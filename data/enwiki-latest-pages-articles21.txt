The Graham River is a river in the Marlborough Region of New Zealand. It arises to the south-east of Mount McCormick and flows north, then west, then north again, and into Whatamango Bay on the south side of Queen Charlotte Sound.

Part of the river valley was subdivided into residential sections in the 1950s. Some of the sections were built on in 2000. Because flooding occurred in the area in November 1994 and July 1998, and to a lesser extent in May 1995, the Marlborough District Council required minimum floor levels and imposed a disclaimer notice on residents.

Unexpected very heavy rain caused a flash flood on the Graham River on 17 February 2004. The rain also caused floods at Waikawa and Picton. Residential land was covered by deep and fast-flowing water. This was estimated to be a once-in-200-years event. Another flood occurred in 2005. The council agreed to remove gravel from the upper reaches of the river, because the gravel had been swept downriver during flooding and would reduce the river channel capacity.

Hapuku River

The Hapuku River begins in the Seaward Kaikoura Range of New Zealand and flows south-east to enter the South Pacific at Hapuka, between Clarence and Kaikoura. The name comes from the Māori word hapuku or hapuka, a deep-water marine fish. Its main tributary is the Puhi Puhi River.

The Hapuku is bridged by a , 1940 bridge on 23 spans of on the Main North Line and by an 11 span, long, wide, 1983 SH1 bridge. The first bridge was completed in 1915, with foundations over deep, though the approaches were a little later.

Whilst other rivers were affected by serious flooding in 1953, the Hapuku rose only at the railway bridge. Presumably this was due to the short catchment, the tectonic uplift of its headwaters and the width of the braided river bed, which is a source of railway ballast. However, an 1868 flood had more of an impact upstream, leaving a bank and a 1941 flood damaged the railway.

Wildlife associated with the area include black-eyed geckos, found near the headwaters of the north branch Hapuku River, and bluff wetas. Banded dotterels breed in the Hapuku. Introduced species include red deer, goats (kept at low levels by culling), pigs and chamois.

There were two DoC huts in the valley; Hapuku Hut and Barratts Bivvy, linked by walking tracks. However, a slip triggered by the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake blocked the river, with water building up behind the slip and destroying Barratts Hut and Bivvy.

Hapuka railway station was open from 13 March 1944 to 29 March 1981. A passing loop and ballast siding remain.

The Makaroro River is a river of the southern Hawke's Bay region of New Zealand's North Island. It flows southeast from the slopes of the Ruahine Range, meeting the waters of the Waipawa River west of Tikokino.

The upper river is the proposed site for the Ruataniwha Water Storage Scheme, also called the Tukituki Catchment Proposal, a dam to create a 93 million m³ storage reservoir. The project was proposed by the Hawke's Bay Regional Council to ensure water sustainability for the region around the dam site. The Council created the Hawke's Bay Regional Investment Company Ltd in 2013 to manage the project. Due to the nature of the Regional Council's relationship, the resource consent was handled by the Environmental Protection Authority, and the Department of Conservation due to some of the land on the proposed site being part of the Ruahine Forest Park.

After the initial approval in 2014, two appeals lodged by Hawke's Bay and Eastern Fish and Game Councils and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand and cross appeal lodged by the Environmental Defence Society were examined by the High Court to reconsider the conditions of consent. On 12 December 2014 Justice Collins ordered the Board to reconsider their decision on an appropriate mechanism for managing the amount of nitrogen that enters the catchment area and giving parties a fair opportunity to comment. The final decision was released 25 June 2015 which included some amendments to the previous consent conditions.
Forest and Bird appealed the decision to allow for the transfer of 170ha of farmland for 22ha of protected conservation land in Ruahine Forest Park which would be flooded for the dam to the Appeal Court. The Court ruled on 31 August 2016 that the Director-General of Conservation was not entitled to revoke the special conservation status of a small portion in exchange for the parkland. This decision was further appealed by the Hawke's Bay Regional Investment Company Ltd and the Minister of Conservation to the Supreme Court on 27 and 28 February 2017. The court ruled on 6 July 2017 dismissing the appeal and upholding the decision that the conservation status could not be revoked under the scheme. In August 2017 Regional Council withdrew its support for the scheme and wrote off $14m it had invested in it.

SH3 crosses the river on a bridge near Otorohanga built in 1966 and near Hangatiki on a concrete bridge built in 1977. The railway follows the east bank for about , crossing only small tributaries, though it did suffer from flooding, for example in 1905.

The river at Otorohanga is classed as being in the worst 25% of similar sites as regards all measured pollutants, though some attempts are being made at restoration.

The reserve of kahikatea forest on the east bank of the river, was purchased by the Native Forests Restoration Trust in 2001.

A major drainage scheme was carried out just upstream from the reserve in the 1930s, including emptying of a lake. The forest floods in winter and flood protection would be uneconomic. Some kahikatea in the reserve are about 120 years old. The reserve also has swamp maire, matai, titoki and pukatea.

Opuiaki River

The Opuiaki River is a river of the Bay of Plenty Region of New Zealand's North Island. It flows north from the Mamaku Plateau into Lake McLaren, to reach the Wairoa River southwest of Tauranga. The river contributes to the Kaimai Hydro power scheme built in the 1980s. A dam was built up hill from where the Ngatuhoa Lodge is now located. From the dam a tunnel was dug,which channels the water into the Ngatuhoa Stream, where it enters just above another dam built there. Provisions are made to maintain some flow in both streams. Digging the tunnel was a challenging operation due to the geology of the area, formed by volcanic activity from various volcanoes, with clay and other sediment in between. Artesian waters also flow between the layers of rock and contribute to the flow of the streams in the area.

The Opuiaki River includes one of the best hidden gems in the Kaimai Ranges, the Te Rere I Oturu Falls.

Te Rere I Oturu Falls

The Te Rere I Oturu Falls are located in the Opuiaki River[1], Kaimai Ranges, New Zealand with the following coordinates: 37° 55' 34.89" S 175° 59' 55.38" E. The name is based on a legend about a member of the Ngati Ranginui hapu.[2]. His name was Oturu and while being pursued by members of his tribe, he jumped from the falls. The falls are about wide and high. The Opuiaki river is mainly rain-fed and the flow can change rapidly during and immediately after a tropical downpour.[3]. The falls can be reached via hiking tracks starting at the Ngatuhoa Lodge. A gravel forestry road runs passed at some distance, from where a hiking track leads to the falls. The river runs through, and is part of, the Opuiaki Ecological Area, created for the protection of native flora and fauna. The Department of Conservation (DOC) carries out pest control and breeding programs, including the Kokako, a native bird listed as an endangered species.

Rees River

The Rees River ("Pua hiri") is a headwater tributary of the Clutha/Mata-Au that drains eastward of the main divide of the Southern Alps of New Zealand. Located at the head of Lake Wakatipu, the Rees River runs 41 km and drains an area of 406 km and discharges into Lake Wakatipu at Glenorchy. Bound by the Richardson ("Whakari") Mountains to the east and the Forbes Mountains to the west, its headwaters exceed 2000 m.a.s.l. and are partially snow covered. The upper parts of the Rees River occupies a formerly glaciated valley that was fed by the Tyndall Glacier, which now drains into the adjacent Dart Valley. Below Rees Saddle the river valley is constrained by a series of steep alluvial fans that are fed from tributary basins. The lithology of the Rees catchment is highly erodible schist of the Aspiring lithologic association. The underlying schist is highly fissive due to its fine-grain, segregated quart-feldspar-mica composition. The Rees valley is covered in indigenous tussock grasses and forest and is a popular location for recreational fly fishing, pack rafting and hiking, including the 4–5 day hike on the Dart-Rees Track. However, the steep topography, easily erodible lithology, proximity to the alpine fault, and intense rainfalls contribute to potential geohazard risks in the region. A debris flow swept away a hiker during a river crossing in an unnamed tributary in the Upper Rees Valley near Cleft Peak in January 2002.

The Rees river and valley get their gazetted name from the high country station, was originally part of the runs established by William Gilbert Rees who was the first sheep farmer in the Wakatipu Basin.  Ownership of the station has been in the Scott family since 1905 and the Rees Valley Station is maintained in perpetuity as a part of Crown Pastoral Lease.  The lower Rees Valley, which continues to operate as a beef and sheep grazing farm, but was also used as a filming location for "", and television drama series "Top of the Lake".

The Tawatahi River is a short river of the Waikato Region of New Zealand's North Island. It flows into the northern shore of Raglan Harbour.

The headwaters are listed as worthy of preservation for their geology - "New Katuku Trig / Pukewharangi Hill Oligocene fossil locality" Most of the rock in the valley is Kotuku siltstone, a massive to crudely bedded, light- to blue-grey jointed, calcareous siltstone. The upper slopes are mainly Mangiti Sandstone and Patikirau Siltstone, also calcareous rocks. All were laid on a deepening mid to outer shelf in the Whaingaroan age, about 41 million years ago.

The river has also been called Burgess's Creek, after the farmer who owned Burgess Point to the west, Kerikeri Peninsula, or Puketutu. James Burgess farmed almost 600 sheep in the late C19th, having previously been a shepherd on Te Akau Station, which had included this area. He had burnt the flax and sown grass on the peninsula.

A 2012 survey found the estuary had a wide band of rushes grading into native forest, with mud crabs, titiko, coastal daisy, makaka, oioi, fescue, marsh clubrush, remuremu, sea primrose, sand buttercup, kowhai, kanuka, miro, tanekaha and hangehange.

Taylor River (New Zealand)

The Taylor River is one of the two rivers that flow across the Wairau Plain into Blenheim, New Zealand, where it joins the Ōpaoa River. It arises near Taylor Pass to the south of the Wither Hills and flows north-east and north. The river and pass were named for Joseph Taylor, a New Zealand Company surveyor who worked in the area from 1842.

At the time Blenheim was settled and for some years thereafter, floods were frequent occurrences in winter at the confluence of the two rivers and occasioned the nickname "Beavertown" for Blenheim because of the fancied resemblance to beaver lodges of buildings in the town when surrounded by floodwaters. The town mascot is a beaver in spite of the fact that none have ever existed in New Zealand, as they are a prohibited animal.

Waitakaruru River

The Waitakaruru River is a river of the Waikato Region of New Zealand's North Island. It flows initially north before turning northwest across the northwestern corner of the Hauraki Plains, reaching the southwestern corner of the Firth of Thames close to the settlement of Waitakaruru.

Grey mangrove, or mānawa, has rapidly colonised the estuary since 1940, due to sediment deposited by the rivers and climate change.

The river should not be confused with the similarly named Waitakaruru Stream, which is also in the Waikato Region, near Morrinsville.

In its lower reaches the river is not fit for swimming, as the nitrogen and phosphorus pollution levels are many times those of the natural river.

Pollution has generally been worsening, as shown in this table -

<doc id="23583901" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23583901" title="Waitangitaona River">
Waitangitaona River

The Waitangitaona River was the name of a single river of the West Coast Region of New Zealand's South Island.

Following a March 1967 avulsion, when it became two rivers, in 2018 they were renamed Waitangitāhuna River, for what had separated into the northern river, and Waitakitāhuna-ki-te-Toka, for the southern river.

Te Rūnanga o Makaawhio asked the New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) to alter the names, after the 1967 flood diverted the river to a new course across an alluvial fan. Most of the southern flow runs into Lake Wahapo, but some was redirected (though the northern river is no longer fed by the southern river) into Graham Creek, which flows into the northern Waitangitaona River at its confluence with Matainui Creek, and then into Tasman Sea.

NZGB accepted the change because major stopbanks erected in the mid-1980s have reduced the possibility of another avulsion of the river back to its former course, there is significant recreational use, so that emergency services sometimes need to identify the discrete rivers and the change recognises the historical significance of each name.

Waitakitāhuna-ki-te-Toka, the southern river, flows for about to Lake Wahapo, initially west, including a waterfall, from its origins in the snowfields of the Tatare Range, south of Whataroa. From Lake Wahapo the water runs through Trustpower's 3.1MW Wahapo power station, built in 1960, to the Ōkārito River. SH6 is the only bridge over the river.

Waitangitāhuna River (translates to sounding, or weeping water), the northern river, flows generally north, then westwards for approximately from its source at the confluence of Graham Creek and Matainui Creek (which flows through Whataroa) to its mouth at the Tasman Sea, just north of Okarito Lagoon. The shorter Waitangiroto River follows a roughly parallel course to the lower Waitangitaona one kilometre to the south. The Whataroa River reaches the Tasman to the north of the Waitangitaona's mouth.
