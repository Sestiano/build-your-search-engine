<doc id="62064162" title="2020 (Richard Dawson album)">
2020 is a studio album by avant-garde folk musician Richard Dawson, released on 11 October 2019 by Weird World, an imprint of Domino Recording Company. Like its 2017 predecessor, Peasant, each song on the album is from the perspective of a different fictional narrator. Through these individual perspectives, 2020 explores modern British citizens' broad social attitudes and anxieties. The album's press release describes Britain as "an island country in a state of flux; a society on the edge of mental meltdown".
With the exception of "Dead Dog in an Alleyway", which featured contributions from Sally Pilkington, Nev Clay, and Rhodri Davies, Dawson played all of the instruments on 2020. For the drums, Dawson recorded each instrument individually, which in his estimation resulted in a "stilted" performance. "It’s the first time I’ve used the rock drum sound and I wanted this to appear as a straighter album, but actually it still needs this awkwardness. So how do I get that? Well, maybe I get someone who can’t play drums to play the drums!"

AM is the fifth studio album by English rock band Arctic Monkeys. It was produced by longtime collaborator James Ford and co-produced by Ross Orton at Sage & Sound Recording in Los Angeles and Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree, California, and released on 9 September 2013 through Domino Recording Company. The album was promoted by the singles "R U Mine?", "Do I Wanna Know?", "Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?", "One for the Road", "Arabella", and "Snap Out of It". It features guest appearances by Josh Homme, Bill Ryder-Jones, and Pete Thomas.
Drawing inspiration from a wide range of genres, including psychedelic rock, blues rock, hard rock, heavy metal, desert rock, R&B, funk and soul, AM notably marks Arctic Monkeys' first venture into a hip hop-influenced sound. The band took a different approach to recording the album in comparison to their previous album, Suck It and See (2011), with more emphasis on creating a "studio album" according to frontman Alex Turner. The band incorporated new instruments on the album, including the piano, organ, Hohner Guitaret, and vintage drum machine. Thematically, the album concerns frustration surrounding tainted romance, sex and loneliness.
Commercially, the album has become one of Arctic Monkeys' most successful to date, topping charts in several countries, and reaching top ten positions in many more. Topping the UK Albums Chart, it sold over 157,000 copies in its first week and also went on to be one of the UK's best-selling vinyl albums of the decade, selling 73,000 units. In addition, the album became the band's most successful in the United States. The single "Do I Wanna Know?" became the first song by the band to enter the Billboard Hot 100, with the album topping four Billboard charts and being certified four-times platinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2023.
AM received critical acclaim, with critics praising its darker and groovier sound in comparison to the band's previous records. It won the Brit Award for British Album of the Year, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance ("Do I Wanna Know?") and the Mercury Prize. Several media publications have ranked AM among the best albums of 2013, of the 2010s, and of all time. NME called it the best album of the decade, and included it on its "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" list. Rolling Stone included it on the 2020 edition of its "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" list.

It was produced in Suffolk, Paris and London by frequent Arctic Monkeys collaborator James Ford, alongside frequent guest musicians Tom Rowley, Loren Humphrey and Tyler Parkford, and arranged by Bridget Samuels, Ford and Turner. Drummer Matt Helders took the picture on the album cover, which depicts a white Toyota Camry in an otherwise empty parking garage on a Los Angeles rooftop. Its title refers to said cover and the abundance of vehicular references in the lyrics.
The Car builds upon the sound from the band's previous album, Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino (2018). It features a wide array of genres that include art rock, orchestral rock, lounge pop, baroque pop, and funk, as well as elements of jazz. It also draws influence from soul music, electronic music, glam rock, bossa nova, traditional pop and vintage film soundtracks. Its lyrical content explores nostalgia and show business, specifically the music and film industries.
The album received critical acclaim upon its release.

It was nominated for the 2023 Ivor Novello Awards and the 2024 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album, as well as being shortlisted for the 2023 Mercury Prize. The single "There'd Better Be a Mirrorball" was nominated for Best Alternative Music Performance at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards.

The album was promoted by the singles "There'd Better Be a Mirrorball", "Body Paint" and "I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am", all of which peaked within the top 25 on the UK Singles Chart, as well as by a global tour and multiple television appearances.

Between albums, Hynes has written and produced music for the likes of Solange, Sky Ferreira, MKS, and more.
Cupid Deluxe shows a more expansive aural palate than the previous release Coastal Grooves, while still retaining the pop sensibilities that Hynes has showcased since his days in Test Icicles and Lightspeed Champion. The album features many guest appearances, including performances from David Longstreth (Dirty Projectors), Caroline Polachek (Chairlift), Samantha Urbani (Friends), Clams Casino, Despot, Adam Bainbridge (Kindness), Skepta and more. The album was streamed in full on Hynes' own YouTube channel on 5 November 2013.
Speaking about the album, Hynes said it was inspired by "New York City, the Big Apple. I lived in Brooklyn for some time and finally made the leap into Manhattan. So a lot of the record is about that, transitions, life transitions. Moving from a stable position to an unstable position. Something we have all been through."
Pitchfork Media ranked the record 35th among their top 200 albums of the 2010s article.
