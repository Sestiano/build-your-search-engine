<doc id="27555054" title="List of doping cases in athletics">
The use of performance-enhancing drugs (doping in sport) is prohibited within the sport of athletics. Athletes who are found to have used such banned substances, whether through a positive drugs test, the biological passport system, an investigation or public admission, may receive a competition ban for a length of time which reflects the severity of the infraction. Athletes who are found to have banned substances in their possession, or who tamper with or refuse to submit to drug testing can also receive bans from the sport. Competitive bans may also be given to athletes who test positive for prohibited recreational drugs or stimulants with little performance-enhancing effect for competitors in athletics. The sports body responsible for determining which substances are banned in athletics is the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
Typically, any athlete who tests positive for banned substances after having served a previous ban receives a lifetime ban from the sport of athletics. Many high-profile sportspeople to receive doping bans have come from the sport of athletics, with significant past cases concerning Ben Johnson, Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery. Furthermore, a number of athletes who underwent state-sponsored doping programmes in East Germany and the Soviet Union between the 1950s and 1980s were competitors in athletics, but the quality of the international anti-doping work was so poor that only one East German athlete ever tested positive. Following allegations of state-sponsored doping in Russia, the IAAF suspended the country's athletes from competition, including the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Wayne John Athorne (7 September 1941 – 4 April 1992) was a national decathlon champion and Commonwealth Games competitor. He was also an Australian rules footballer with Hawthorn in the Victorian Football League (VFL).
Athorne played his early football at Xavier College and trialled at Melbourne before making his VFL debut for Hawthorn in a win over Carlton at Glenferrie Oval in the 1961 season. Hawthorn went on to win their first ever premiership that season. The following year he left football to pursue his love of athletics.
As a decathlon athlete, Athorne finished second to John O'Neill in the 1965 Australian Open Track & Field Championships. He won the decathlon in 1966 at Perry Lakes Stadium in Perth by beating South Australian John Hamann with 30 points.
Having become the Australian champion, Athorne competed in the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games held in Jamaica. He finished fifth in the 120 yards hurdles in 15.34 seconds. In the decathlon he accumulated 710 points before an injury to his right knee sustained during the long jump. The injury forced him to withdraw. The injury meant he was unable to take up a scholarship to University of California, Santa Barbara, which he was offered. 
In 1975, Athorne confessed to taking performance-enhancing drugs for the three months leading up to the 1966 Commonwealth Games. He took Dianabol, an anabolic steroid, which was banned by the International Olympic Committee in 1967.

<doc id="17789359" title="Olutoyin Augustus">
Olutoyin "Toyin" Augustus (born 24 December 1979) is a former Nigerian hurdler who competed in the 100 metres hurdles.
She began her career with a win at the African Championships in Athletics in 2006, easily beating the opposition to the 100 m hurdles title. She went on to represent Africa at the 2006 IAAF World Cup, where she finished in eighth place. In 2007, she added the All-Africa Games title to her continental one, holding off a challenge from compatriot Jessica Ohanaja. She began competing at the global level, making appearances at the 2007 World Championships, 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships and the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, but she did not get past the heats stage at any of the events. She faced strong competition at continental level also, as Fatmata Fofanah took the 100 m hurdles title at the 2008 African Championships, leaving Augustus to settle for the silver medal.
She ran at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, taking part in the hurdles competition as well as the women's 4×100 metres relay race for Nigeria. She reached the semi-final stage in the hurdles but was later disqualified and finished 16th overall in the sprint relay event. At the Berlin World Championships, Augustus was subject to a blood and urine test for the WADA. Her blood sample had no documented negative findings, but her urine sample tested positive for abnormal high levels of testosterone. The IAAF Doctor's opinion stated that "This finding could be compatible with an administration of testosterone and/or related prohormones…"
A series of examinations and tests conducted by an MD specialist in gynecology and reproductive endocrinology at the USC (University of Southern California) Medical Hospital found that Augustus had multiple ovarian cysts which the doctor linked to a disorder called Polycystic Ovary Syndrome or PCOS. PCOS is a metabolic dysfunction causing hormonal disruptions and elevated DHEA, a precursor hormone to other reproductive hormones such as testosterone.
To contest the positive doping test and defend her case, Augustus (a United States resident) was required to attend the B sample testing conducted in Germany. If the B sample was also positive, she would then have to fly to Nigeria to present her case to a committee appointed by her country's athletic federation. This committee would be the ruling body on her case. 
Although the doctor at USC concluded that the PCOS disorder caused the elevated DHEA levels in Augustus’ urine sample, these findings were rejected by the Nigerian committee. Augustus was ordered to serve the two year mandatory ban from IAAF sanctioned athletics competitions.
Augustus’ case was under review for several months, coming to a close in 2010. During this period Augustus continued to compete internationally, but withdrew from a competition in Belgium after notification that her case was rejected. Her ban was extended until February 2012 after it was discovered that she had competed while ineligible.
Toyin has recently been featured in various television spots for Xfinity 3D, Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader? and most notably NCAA where she and other student athletes debunk the myth of the dumb jock stigma.
Her personal best time is 12.85 seconds, achieved in 2009 in Nantes.
She was let go of her role as the Director of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging at Oakwood School in Los Angeles, California in 2023.  Previously, she coached soccer and track at Phillips Exeter Academy.
