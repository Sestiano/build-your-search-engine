This article says Ted Cruz won the support of 551 delegates. Politico and the Wall Street Journal say he won 559 delegates, and the RNC says he won 544. Perplexing. Does anyone have a clue which one is correct? SunCrow (talk) 03:11, 19 November 2018 (UTC)

The article includes a good deal of unsourced material and has been tagged accordingly. SunCrow (talk) 05:33, 17 May 2019 (UTC)

SunCrow I undid your revert because the citations discussing about the GOP's procedures/processes are there: 15, 195, and possibly some others. I also think that we should not remove a large section of a prominent Wikipedia page that has probably been on there for over 2-3 years without a lot of reason to do so besides "remove unsourced". Surely the hundreds, if not thousands of editors prior to this incident agreed or did not find fault with the Processes section. Aviartm (talk) 05:51, 17 May 2019 (UTC)
Aviartm, thank you for letting me know about your edit. I have tagged the "Process" section as needing more sources. Multiple paragraphs are completely unsourced. In your edit summary, you said that the sources for this material were listed in other places in the article. They should be added as inline citations here as well. (With respect, I disagree with you that unsourced material that has been in an article for a long time should not be removed without justification. Per WP:VERIFY, any unsourced material in a Wikipedia article can be challenged or removed. Whether or not other editors find fault with that unsourced material is beside the point.) SunCrow (talk) 07:10, 17 May 2019 (UTC)
SunCrow Great! Thank you for adding the template to the section. I agree that the citations should be located where material is mentioned from it within an article. And I understand what you mean with your last point but something that descriptive, surely it is reputable and verifiable somewhere. And as mentioned, looking at the citations that I mentioned, it appears that some of the Processes are there, if not a majority or all. Aviartm (talk) 22:01, 17 May 2019 (UTC)

Carson and Bush were added to the infobox here only recently, a few days ago. The only apparent reason for this sudden change relates to the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries talk page, where several people, including @Cookieo131: and @Shhhhwwww!!:, argued from Wiki-precedent that only candidates who won at least one contest or 5% of the popular vote were included in the infobox (here, just Trump, Cruz, Rubio, and Kasich). So, apparently to advance their argument than *any* candidate with a few delegates should be in a presidential primary infobox, some folks added two candidates who did not meet the 5%/win contest threshold here. I suggest that these two less-significant candidates be removed from the infobox and precedent restored until some uniform standard can be agreed upon.--Wikibojopayne (talk) 20:12, 31 March 2020 (UTC)

I agree that they should be removed. The standard should be 5% popular vote, 5% of delegate, or winning any contest. Michelangelo1992 (talk) 15:19, 4 April 2020 (UTC)
Funnily enough, the template for a presidential primary infobox actually uses the old 2016 primary box, the one with just four candidates. Agreed on the removal of Carson and Bush by the way. GrapevinePoly (talk) 02:36, 28 April 2020 (UTC)

The close races section is flagrantly against MOS:COLOR and is inaccessible for colorblind readers, and for other readers as well. There is no need to use color in this way to convey the winners of each race. :3 F4U (talk) 17:04, 9 March 2023 (UTC)

Agreed.  I added the winners.  --Spiffy sperry (talk) 17:41, 9 March 2023 (UTC)

In the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries map, American Samoa is showed as won by Jason Palmer because he won the popular vote there, despite tying his delegate count with that of Joe Biden. Here, despite Donald Trump getting more votes than John Kasich, it is shown as a tie. Should one of either articles be fixed? IntervoidWiki (talk) 19:19, 12 June 2024 (UTC)

No change is needed. The situations are very similar, as are the maps. Please note that there are two maps that are relevant here: the popular vote map and the delegate map. On the 2016 Republican page, Vermont is shown as a tie for delegates and an outright win based on popular vote. Same for the 2024 Democratic page. American Samoa is shown as a tie for delegates and a win based on popular vote. There are buttons in the infobox that will allow you to change the map which is shown. Michelangelo1992 (talk) 20:36, 12 June 2024 (UTC)
Ah nevermind, it just starts off on different voting systems per page. No change needed. IntervoidWiki (talk) 15:37, 13 June 2024 (UTC)

I've added Template:more citations needed and Template:primary sources to the article, since there are a few paragraphs with no references and the article heavily relies on the Ryan affirmation. The latter concern is, I think, less critical, but I want to flag it: The Ryan affirmation is cited roughly 40 times—by far it is the most-cited reference in the article. There are a couple paragraph that rely on it almost to exclusion of everything else—the vacatur section, in my estimation, is particularly too-reliant on the affirmation, since the affirmation is being cited as a source for its own contents—again, not an egregious issue, but I think secondary sources discussing the affirmation could likely be found.--Jerome Frank Disciple (talk) 16:28, 31 March 2023 (UTC)

There appears to be a dispute over whether the main template should say "exonerated" or "vacated". I would argue:

That nothing should mentioned in the "accused" section of the template—on that point I actually do feel relatively strongly. I can't find other examples where an outcome is paired with "Accused"—and doing so is putting the cart before the horse. I other cases, we don't say "(all found not guilty)" or "(all found guilty)" on comparable pages. The result of the case, including the ultimate vacatur, is discussed in the Verdict section.
That "vacated" should be the term used. Here, I don't feel particularly strongly, but the technical legal term would be "vacated", and we have reliable sources describing the court as doing just that.
--Jerome Frank Disciple (talk) 17:28, 7 April 2023 (UTC)

Central Park accused Yusef Salaam is currently a candidate for NYC City Council and should get a new article of his own on this.  This fact is a public record.96.39.242.97 (talk) 01:29, 4 July 2023 (UTC)

Even if it wasn't American Justice, l can still recall watching a show on this case before Reyes made his confession. Tnarrud3 (talk) 15:51, 22 January 2024 (UTC)

I saw this appears in the article: "The Central Park events, which were attributed at the time to members of the large group of youths who attacked numerous persons in the park, including whites, blacks and browns and yellows." are "browns and yellows" really the terms wikipedia wants to use? Maapmaay (talk) 02:40, 11 September 2024 (UTC)

I just now reverted that very recent edit.  I’m not aware that reliable sources use the word “yellow” as a noun. Anythingyouwant (talk) 03:20, 11 September 2024 (UTC)
