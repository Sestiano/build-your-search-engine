Prajapathi

Prajapathi "(Leader of the People)" is a Malayalam movie directed by Ranjith.

The music is by Tej Manoj and lyrics are by Girish Puthencherry. The film was shot close to Gopichettipalayam in Tamil Nadu.

Devar Madom Narayanan (Mammootty) is accused of killing his father, for being cruel to his mother, at the age of 13 and serves a sentence in a juvenile home. When he returns, he becomes leader of the people of Perumalpuram village. He ensures the village is devoid of all wrongdoers by expelling them. His enemies are his uncle Kunjambu Nair (Nedumudi Venu) and wife Indrani (Seema). Kunjambu Nair hated Narayanan killing his brother, although Kunjambu Nair and his son Giri (Siddique) tried in many ways to kill Narayanan. At one point Giri almost succeeded in killing Devar madom Narayanan. Narayanan again didn’t react. He was on good terms with Kunjambu Nair’s daughter (Sandhya) and his Murapennu (Aditi Rao). Giri tries to sell his land in Perumalpuram to some outsider whose arrival, Narayanan knew, would destroy the harmony of the village. That is when Narayanan decides to react.

It turns out that Kunjambu Nair was the one who actually killed his father for their wealth. Narayanan helps Ali Raghavan (Sreenivasan), the real son of Kunjambu Nair, to gain his birthright. When Giri finds that he is the stepson of Kunjambu Nair, he kills his stepfather. The family drives him away from home with the help of Narayanan. The rest of the film is about how and if Giri takes revenge on Narayanan.

The film received negative reviews from critics, and bombed at the box office.

The film's soundtrack contains five songs, all composed by Thej Mervin, with lyrics by Gireesh Puthenchery.

Kannamoochi Yenada

Kannamoochi Yenada? () is a 2007 Tamil romantic comedy film written and directed by V. Priya. The film stars Prithviraj, Sandhya, Sathyaraj, and Raadhika in the lead roles and Sripriya, Radha Ravi, and Manobala in supporting roles. The film's score and soundtrack is composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja. The film, a remake of the 2005 American film "Guess Who", which is itself a remake of the 1967 American film "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner", was jointly produced and distributed by Raadan Media Works, UTV, and Pyramid Saimira. The music was composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja with cinematography by Preetha Jayaraman and editing by Sathish Suriya. It released on 8 November 2007 during Deepavali. The film's title was inspired from a song from "Kandukondain Kandukondain".

Harish Venkatraman (Prithviraj Sukumaran), a software architect by profession who lives in Malaysia, is the millionaire nephew of Maheswaran Iyer (Radha Ravi). Having lost his parents early in life, he runs his uncle's business with impressive results. He stumbles upon the psychiatry student Devasena (Sandhya) in the most cinematic manner and falls for her that very instant. Deva is the daughter of Commissioner Arumugam Gounder (Sathyaraj) and Dhamayanthi (Raadhika) in Chennai. As the plot progresses, Deva is being summoned by her parents for their silver jubilee wedding anniversary back home. Notwithstanding the fact he has a flourishing business to attend to and much to the wrath of his uncle - who arranges for his wedding with his business partner’s daughter - Harish takes the next flight to Chennai to accompany Deva. He is subjected to a warm welcome by Dhamayanthi and cold shoulder by Arumugam. To make matters worse, Maheswaran's vicious character assassination – in the name of a complaint he sends to the police commissioner’s office – doesn’t help Harish in the task of gaining enough confidence among his girlfriend’s parents. Will Harish win his love back, now that his chance of impressing Deva’s parents are doomed?


The music was scored by Yuvan Shankar Raja, teaming up with director V. Priya again after "Kanda Naal Mudhal" (2005). The soundtrack was released on 23 August 2007 by Vivek Oberoi. It features 5 tracks, including a retune of the yesteryear hit song "Andru Vandhadhum" from the M. G. R.-starrer "Periya Idathu Penn", being just the second song to be retuned after A. R. Rahman's "Thottal Poo Malarum" from the film "New". Noticeably, singer Shankar Mahadevan lent his voice for three songs. Lyrics were provided by Thamarai.

Yuvan Shankar Raja won accolades for creating an "interesting" and "thoroughly enjoyable" album, which was cited to be "an absolute treat to listen to". "Behindwoods", which described the song "Kannamoochi" as "this year’s one of the most enjoyable songs" and the song "Sanjaram" as a "masterpiece", said, that the Yuvan-Priya duo had even bettered their previous venture "Kanda Naal Mudhal", giving the album four out of five stars.

"Sify" wrote "On the whole, the first half wins you over with its simple charm, its immensely likeable characters, and the intrinsic humour in the writing. But the latter half is too long, contrived and predictable to the extent of being seriously boring. In the final analysis, however, these are a few wrong turns in an otherwise entertaining film that'll bring a smile to your face". "Behindwoods" wrote "To sum it all up, V. Priya's effort is noteworthy, if her first movie was like a morning cup of coffee for the youth, this time she serves well for the whole family".

Pallikoodam (film)

Pallikoodam () is a 2007 Indian Tamil language feature film directed and cinematographed by Thangar Bachchan. Narain, Sneha, Sriya Reddy, Seeman and the director himself form the cast. Narain plays Vetrivel, a collector, while Sriya Reddy is a nurse, Sneha is a teacher named Kokila and Seeman plays Muthu. The film deals with four different periods – 1978, 1983, 1991 and 2004.

The movie revolves around an ailing school in a village in Cuddalore district where the land owner wants to demolish the school while the old students prevent the school from getting shut. Kokila (Sneha) works in the school where she had also studied. The school was constructed by Kokila’s grandfather years ago and dispute arises between her family members, where her uncle wanted to demolish the school and sell the land as the school is in a very bad state.

The school teachers come up with a plan of organising an alumni get together, so that the school can be saved. Kumarasamy aka Kumar (Thagar Bachan) is a poor man who lives in the same village and is the classmate of Kokila. He is sent to Kanchipuram to meet the district collector Vetrivel (Naren) who also happens to be the alumni of the same school. Vetri and Kumar were close friends during childhood and both feel happy meeting after years. Meanwhile, the two also get to meet Muthu (Seeman) who is a film director now and is also their close friend. All the three friends get united after many years.

A flashback is shown where Vetri, Kumar and Muthu were close friends during schooldays. All three belong to poor families and Vetri falls in love with his classmate Kokila, who is a rich girl. Jhansi (Shriya) is a nurse who visits the village for conducting a medical camp. All three boys get closer to Jhansi as she is kind and she looks after them very well. Jhansi takes care of Muthu's education after his father’s sudden death.

Meanwhile, Vetri and Kokila’s love affair is known to her family members and they accuse that Jhansi helped the love and insults her in front of the villagers. Jhansi gets hurt and leaves the village. Muthu also leaves the village along with Jhansi . Vetri goes out of village for undergraduation. Vetri clears civil services and comes back to village with plans of marrying Kokila in a registrar office. But Kokila refuses getting married without her family's consent and requests Vetri to meet her parents once with the hope that they would agree as he is well educated now. But, Kokila's father beat Vetri and his father and in the fight, Vetri's father dies. Kokila's family members lock her in a room. Vetri gets furious that Kokila didn't turn up at the time of his visit and also worries due to his father's death. Vetri decides to leave the village with no plans of returning again.

Coming back to present, all three friends meet and share their old good memories. Muthu is married and he takes care of Jhansi still. Also Kumar is married. Kumar describes the pathetic state of their old school in village and requests them to take some action to prevent it from getting shut. The friends decides to try all means to conduct an alumni reunion. But Vetri is not interested to return to the village as he has been humiliated by Kokila’s family members long time ago. Kumar and Muthu convince Vetri to come to village. Kokila still loves Vetri but Kumar lies to Kokila that Vetri is married which makes Kokila angry. Kokila feels that Vetri has ditched her and started a new life while she still loves him.

An event has been organized to celebrate the 75th year of the school by inviting all the alumni. Vetri and Muthu are invited as special guests as that would make the event more popular. Vetri and Muthu arrive at the village and visit their school. Vetri and Kokila donot talk to each other. The event is organized in a grand manner and this attracts the media attention also. But still the land owner wants to demolish the school. Vetri files a case on behalf of the school against Kokila's uncle and gets the verdict in favour of the school. The event successfully happens and everyone feels happy that the school is saved as many alumni donate for renovation works.

Now Kumar informs the truth that Vetri is not yet married and he just lied so that Kokila will forget him and make her mind for marrying someone else. Kokila understands Vetri’s love meanwhile Vetri also understands that Kokila was helpless and was locked up by her family members while Vetri was beaten. Vetri and Kokila get united in the end.

"Rediff" wrote "while Pallikkoodam lacks the class of Azhagi, you can at least return home with memories of your school life." "Indiaglitz" wrote "On the whole, the movie is good and takes one on a nostalgic journey". "Behindwoods" wrote "Overall the movie is well made and will be lapped up by the urban audience. If you thought Azhagi was a fantastic effort, chances are that you would have the same feeling with Tahnkar Bachaan’s new effort as well. Besides, the emotional aspect of the movie is sure to go down well with the female audience."

After Amar Varma's Siva Balaji accidental death in India, Germany-based Varma Industries is on the verge of collapse. Priya Shriya, Amar's fiancée, is devastated, Amar's dad Vijayachander is in shock and unresponsive towards others while Amar's sister Suhani Kalita and grandmother Sowcar Janaki are in mourning. Inspector who is investigating the case is determined to find the person responsible for the accident despite his superiors' indifference towards the case.

Months after Amar's death, a highly respected and talented business worker named Sekhar Tarun offers to re-build and restore Varma Industries without any compensation, stating Amar met him in India and offered him a job before his death. He is given the chance and goes about the uphill task of making the company viable again. Gradually, Sekhar heals the gaping wound left in the Varma family by Amar's death and they come to accept him as one of the family. What they don't know — except for Sunil Sunil, Sekhar's friend in Germany — is that it was Sekhar's jeep that accidentally had hit Amar after he swerved to avoid hitting an innocent girl who had walked into the road, causing his death. Ridden by guilt Sekhar came to Germany to confess, ask for forgiveness, and do whatever he can for the family.

Abhi is a wealthy Germany industrialist who meets Priya and realizes that she is the right woman for him. He is considering proposing to Priya and helping to rebuild Varma Industries. But Priya has fallen in love with Sekhar. Eventually, a conflict arises between Priya and Sekhar regarding a proposition made by Abhi to take over Varma Industries. Sekhar realizes that Priya does not need his help anymore and decides to return to India.

Priya stops Sekhar while he boards his flight and confesses her feelings for him. Sekhar denies his feelings and boards the plane. Devastated, Priya goes home and gets engaged to Abhi. At the airport arrives inspector Tanikella Bharani, from India in search of the person who killed Amar, and arrests Sekhar. They wait, with Sunil, to board the next flight to India. Sekhar calls Priya and tells her how much he loves her and confesses that it was he who hit her fiancé. While talking to priya, Shekhar meets with an accident.

Priya feels guilty about falling for the man who caused Amar's death and confesses it to Amar's father, who surprises her by speaking for the first time after his son's death. He tells her that Sekhar had told him the truth when he first visited them and he believes Sekhar. Amar's family then makes Priya realize how much Sekhar has done for the family and that he is like Amar to them. Sunil informs them about Sekhar's accident. Abhi tells a skeptical Priya to go back to Sekhar as he is her true love. Meanwhile, Inspector who is in the hospital with everyone, understands that the family needs Sekhar more than the law does and simply closes the case and leave. The movie ends with Sekhar recovering and uniting with Priya while Abhi is left devastated and is comforted by his uncle.

Just Married (2007 film)

Just Married is a 2007 Bollywood film directed by Meghna Gulzar and starring Fardeen Khan, Esha Deol in lead roles along with Satish Shah, Kirron Kher and Mukul Dev in supporting roles.

Abhay Sachdeva and Ritika Khanna are young, modern Indian professionals. They briefly meet at a wedding, and individually make their dislike for arranged marriages known, since they do not understand the concept of marrying a stranger. Unbeknownst to them, their parents meet at the same wedding and compare their horoscopes, which begins the process of arranging a match. Even though they each have strong objections, the couple eventually give in to their parents' wishes and get married. The newlyweds then embark on a honeymoon trip to Ooty. The trip is part of a romantic getaway package where they will be sharing a lodge with other couples.

The first people they meet are Mr and Mrs Chaturvedi, an elderly couple celebrating their anniversary. They constantly bicker and argue, but actually love each other deeply. Abhay and Ritika then meet Shoaib and Anaiya, another newlywed couple. Anaiya is Shoaib's sister's best friend and has always had feelings for him, but Shoaib is unable to think of Anaiya as anything but a childhood friend. Strolling in the forest, the pair meet Rishab and Anu, a couple who are head over heels in love with each other and have come to Ooty on their yearly holiday. They have the perfect romance and the other couples envy them and their amazing relationship. Later, Ritika tries to prolong dinner to avoid spending time alone with Abhay. That night she can't bring herself to consummate the marriage, and after Abhay falls asleep she decides to sleep on the sofa. The next day, the group prepares to go on an outing organised by the lodge management. There they meet A.K. and Sarah, who have arrived late due to delayed trains. A.K. is an explorer who has been out of the country for a long time, and Sarah is his long-term, half-Indian girlfriend. A.K. has proposed many times but Sarah does not see the need for marriage.

The couples spend the day exploring the lake and surrounding town. Later, at a celebratory dinner organised for Mr and Mrs Chaturvedi's fortieth anniversary, the group gets better acquainted by sharing the stories of how each couple met. That night Abhay separates the beds in their room so Ritika does not feel uncomfortable any longer. He explains to her that they need to work on their relationship for it to grow; she is still reluctant but her attitude begins to soften. The next day the pair spend time alone, visiting tourist attractions and getting to know each other. The romantic, happy mood is broken that night when Abhay tries to be intimate with Ritika and she lashes out at him, causing an argument. Their relationship is strained but she puts on a show for the other couples, who all believe that they are adjusting to their arranged marriage well. A few days later, a frustrated Abhay expresses his conflicted feelings towards love and marriage, and Mr Chaturvedi gives the men some advice. Meanwhile, the women give Sarah a traditional Indian makeover as a surprise for A.K. He proposes and she accepts, and the other couples plan them a celebration.

At the party Shoaib is finally able to see Anaiya as his wife, and they decide to have dinner alone together. Sarah notices the tension between Abhay and Ritika and advises Ritika to work things out before the issue escalates. The celebrations are cut short when an employee informs Rishab that his wife has called to speak to him, and the group realizes that Anu and Rishab are having an affair. An emotional Anu decides to leave Rishab and the lodge that night. The next day, the group departs from the lodge as the trip comes to an end. The bus has an accident and hangs off the edge of a cliff. Abhay makes a plan to get all the passengers off the bus, but a scared Mr and Mrs Chaturvedi refuse to leave. Ritika gets on board again to convince them to get off, and the frightening situation brings her closer to Abhay.

As everyone else waits for alternative transport, Abhay and Ritika decide to start afresh, and walk towards the direction of the lodge to begin their honeymoon once again.

Lee (2007 film)

Lee is a Tamil language film released on 16 February 2007. The film starred Sibiraj, Prakash Raj and Nila in the lead roles. The film was produced by noted actor and Sibiraj's dad, Sathyaraj and directed by Prabu Solomon. The film was successful at the box office.

Leelatharan aka Lee (Sibiraj) hangs out with a bunch of merry youths who do practically any work and play football in other times. It is a strong-willed and thick-tied group. Chellama (Nila), a worker in a facility for the mentally-challenged, is also kind of a groupie. Life is all merry and mirth till she espies Lee & co, attempting an assassination of sorts on a minister. The bid fails, but Chellama is shocked and so are we. Why would this bunch want to take a crack at the murky world of politics and cricket?

Well, the answer unspools back into a college where Lee and his team are raring to go as footballers and cricketers. They have a committed mentor in Butthiran (Prakash Raj). Though a coach, he is a friend, philosopher, and guide kind of omnibus figure for the youngsters. Just when the boys are making the right progress, problem erupts in the form of Rangabashyam (Zakir Hussain). He is a scumbag, but also the college principal, and he wants his son to be in this all-conquering team.

The coach, with Chappellesque firmness, says no to this and wants to pick his team on merit, but the principal kicks out the team with its coach out of the college itself, so they gravitate towards another college and again start doing well as a team, and when they win a big and prestigious tournament, Rangabashyam throws up a major spanner in the works.

He scuttles the rise of Lee and Co., and the stifling is so bad that one member commits suicide, and the team slowly disintegrates. On the other hand, Rangabashyam rises up in the big bad world of politics. He ends up as a minister. The rest of the movie deals with the conflicts between the two.


Veteran actor Satyaraj is producing Lee which stars his son Sibiraj in the lead role. Prabhu Solomon, who had done a racy action in Kokki earlier, is directing the film. Sibiraj plays Leeladharan alias Lee, a professional football player. Nila plays the female lead. Prakash Raj plays the football coach in the movie.

Says Sibiraj, "I prepared myself for the role with great difficulty. I ensured that I looked different and changed my mannerism a lot. I grew long hair and beard too."

Since Sibiraj plays a footballer, he underwent football coaching at the YMCA every evening. Director Solomon shot a major portion of Lee in the busy roads of Chennai. The movie was shot in the busy roads without the public even being aware of it.

The soundtrack was composed by D. Imman.

"Sify" wrote "First and foremost the film has nothing to do with football and is another revenge drama. In the end there is a long speech by Lee about how corruption, nepotism have seeped into the game of football in India where cricket rules." "Rediff" wrote "Lee may revert to the standard masala elements at points, especially with regard to some stunts (such as Matrix style jumps from one building to the other and flying Maruti Omnis) but it is still different from any other Tamil movie you might have seen off late."

The film was produced by S. P. B. Charan along with J. K. Saravana, a Singapore-based award-winning producer. The film's score and soundtrack were composed by Premji Amaran and Yuvan Shankar Raja, respectively.

The film is based on street cricket played in India, focussing on various themes as friendship, love and rivalry in a suburban area. Following its theatrical release on 27 April 2007, it received critical acclaim and emerged a surprise sleeper hit, running successfully for more than one year in theaters, whilst going on to achieve cult status in the subsequent years. The film's title is derived from the pincode for Mandaveli, a suburb of Chennai, where the story takes place. The success of the film gained the relatively unknown actors — Jai, Shiva, Premji and Nithin Sathya, newcomers Vijayalakshmi, Vijay Vasanth and the director Venkat Prabhu popularity.

Upon release, the film was dubbed into Telugu and released as "Kodithe Kottalira". The film was also remade in Bengali as "Le Chakka" (2010), Sinhalese as "Super Six" (2012), and in Kannada as "Bangalore 560023" (2015). A sequel for the film, "", has also since been released.

The story revolves around two local cricket league teams that compete against each other in local matches and consider each other as sworn enemies. Royapuram Rockers are on top of the chain and keep bashing the Sharks year after year. The heroes of the movie are the Sharks' team.

The story begins when Raghu's (Jai) parents move from Royapuram to Visalakshi Thottam, Chennai 600 028. Raghu is a member of the Royapuram Rockers Cricket team, and a college student living with his parents. He has no choice but to move with them although he detests the area. He is not very excited at the prospect of living in the same area as his sworn enemies. Raghu is faithful to his teammates, but they ignore him because of the distance. Angered at being replaced by a new guy in the team in one of the matches, Raghu estranges himself from cricket and the Rockers.

Raghu informs of Pazhani's (Nithin Sathya) sister Selvi's (Vijayalakshmi) love for Karthik (Shiva) to him. This incident initiates Raghu's friendship with a few Sharks team players and eventually gets induced into the team. Raghu practices with the Sharks to play against the Rockers in the upcoming Radio Mirchi trophy. Pazhani, who soon comes to know of his sister's and Karthik's love affair is disappointed and then there is a tiff amongst the friends. The team splits up for a while, but Karthik apologizes to Pazhani and they make up. The team is united again and they start practicing for the trophy once again. Unfortunately, Karthik gets stabbed by his brother's enemies and is rendered unfit to play the match. Pazhani replaces Karthik as the captain and the team heads for the match.

Under tight pressure and with a nail biting finish, the Sharks finally defeat the Rockers in the semi-finals of the tournament. In the finals they meet their nemesis, a bunch of school kids named Bad Boys-II who practice by bunking school to play cricket on the beach. The kids are really good and the Sharks know it because they have lost to them once before and that too very badly...

The movie ends with the team really struggling to keep it up in the game.

"Chennai 600028" is the directorial debut of Venkat Prabhu. He initially titled the film as "Enga Area Ulla Varaadha" ("Don't come into our territory"), but lyricist Vaali was critical of the idea, feeling that the title was "negative" sounding. Subsequently, the film was renamed as "Chennai 600028", with the idea of including the area's postcode taken from the title of the American television series "Beverly Hills, 90210". Venkat Prabhu felt the new title was "more apt and universal".

The film's score was composed by Venkat Prabhu's brother, Premji Amaran, while his cousin, Yuvan Shankar Raja composed the soundtrack, which also featured two tracks that were rearranged by Premji. The soundtrack album, featuring 9 tracks, released on 19 February 2007 in India and four days later in Singapore and Malaysia, on 23 February 2007. The audio was launched at the radio station Radio Mirchi, broadcasting all the songs live, which was said to be the first time in India. The lyrics were written by 'Kavignar' Vaali and Gangai Amaran, father of Venkat Prabhu. Also, composer Yuvan Shankar Raja penned the lyrics for the song "Natpukullae", besides singing it. 19 singers had rendered their voice for the songs, including Yogi B, DJ Funky Sathiya and SilveStar, two Singaporean rappers, actor Karunas, director Venkat Prabhu and producer S. P. B. Charan.

The album was both critically acclaimed and gained immense popularity upon its release, being described as, "excellent", a "rocking album" and one of the "aesthetic highlights" of the film. The songs were said to be a big hit as reportedly 25000 CDs were sold on the very first day, "ruling the charts" worldwide. The songs "Jalsa" and "Saroja Saman Nikalo" were "rocking the dance floors".

Chennai 600028 was released on 27 April 2007, and emerged as a major commercial success. Sify in their review stated that "All the guys who acted in the film are candid and have let their hair down. RJ Shiva is the surprise packet in the film. Venkat Prabhu deserves a pat on his back for making a breezy fun movie which highlights the fact that cricket in India which is a religion for many is also won through team spirit and sacrifice. So go ahead, make your matinee and enjoy the match." Filmibeat reviewed it as "Apart from cricket there is enough space for love, friendship, sentiments and decent comedy in the script." Baradwaj Rangan reviewed the film as "A street-cricket saga from a bunch of no-names comes out of nowhere and knocks your socks off." Writing for Rediff, the review stated as "The movie is a result of a perfect team effort in every sense. A perfect entertainer, not to be missed."

The film emerged as a sleeper hit at the box office, and also emerging as the cult status, in coming years. The film's 100th day celebrations, took place on 5 August 2007 at Chennai Trade Centre, with Rajinikanth and Kamal Hassan being the chief guest.

Khamosh

Khamosh (English: "Silent") is 1985 Indian thriller directed and produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra. The film starred Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi, Amol Palekar, Soni Razdan and Pankaj Kapoor.

The film became notable for actors Amol Palekar, Soni Razdan and Shabana Azmi portraying fictional versions of themselves.

Soni Razdan is a budding actress. Naseeruddin Shah is a military man. Amol Palekar is an established actor. Shabana Azmi is a fellow actress. Ajit Vachani is a film producer and Pankaj Kapoor is his mentally unstable brother. Sushma Seth plays Mrs. Bhal, a retired actress now doing character roles and pushing her reluctant daughter into the film industry to obtain fame and fortune.

The filming unit enters Pahalgam in Kashmir for their next film. Razdan mysteriously commits suicide. The police are about to call it an open and shut case when Shah enters the scene. He pretends to be a special officer sent to investigate the case, but subsequently his cover is blown. The police come to arrest him just as he about to accuse Mrs Bhal of Razdan's murder as he had found Razdan's missing earring hidden under Mrs Bhal's mattress in her hotel room. Shah then reveals his true identity as Razdan's estranged brother and states that some days before the "suicide", Razdan had sent him a letter that she had gotten the lead role for a prestigious project. As such, he refuses to believe that she committed suicide. The crew accept that Razdan had indeed got the coveted role, but they are less enthusiastic about co-operating now with the police and investigation of her murder.

The only person who believes that Razdan was murdered is Azmi, who heard Razdan practising her lines until late at night. Azmi realises that Razdan was portraying a village girl who spoke no English, but that she had started shouting something in English before she became silent. She agrees to help Shah catch the culprit, and they join forces but more murders happen - first with Mrs Bhal is killed and then the male housekeeper.

Eventually, all clues point to Vachchani, who confesses that his brother Kapoor killed Razdan in a rage when she spurned his advances. Vachchani confesses that he was just covering for him, because his brother was mentally ill. Kapoor goes on a shooting spree, killing Vachchani in the process. It seems like the mystery has been solved but Shah realizes two things : 1] Kapoor's revolver had already been emptied before he "shot" his brother dead. 2] Vachchani had posted a mysterious letter to his lawyer.

Azmi knows where the actual gun used to kill Vachchani is but finds it missing from the props and costumes box. Who is behind all these murders?

As the film had an unconventional plot, no distributor bought it. Chopra showed the film to many persons but no one was interested in releasing it. After more than a year, he decided to distribute it himself. He rented Regal cinema hall in Colaba, Bombay and showed the film there. He could afford only one print of the film where it ran for many weeks.

Sakkarakatti

Sakkarakatti () is a 2008 Indian Tamil-language musical romantic comedy film written and directed by Kalaprabhu and produced by his father, Kalaipuli S. Dhanu. It featured debutant Shanthnoo Bhagyaraj, son of veteran actor K. Bhagyaraj, in the lead role while Ishita Sharma and Vedhika played significant roles. It featured a soundtrack composed by A. R. Rahman, with the song "Taxi Taxi" becoming a megahit before the film's release. "Sakkarakatti" released on 26 September 2008.

Chennai-bred Yuvraj (Shanthnoo Bhagyaraj) has had four close friends from childhood. He meets and falls in love with Deepali (Ishita Sharma). However, his cousin Reema (Vedhika) is in love with him. After Deepali sees Yuvraj with Reema, she becomes jealous and ignores Yuvraj when he follows her. Then, Yuvraj and Deepali get back together. Later, she sees Yuvraj and Reema together, but it was an accident. Deepali starts ignoring him again. Yuvraj wants to prove that he was not with Reema, so his friends decide to throw a birthday party to mend the trio's fractured relationship. Deepali and Yuvraj finally unite.


The producer Kalaipuli S. Dhanu began launched the film, "Sakkarakatti", at AVM Studios on 30 April 2006 with A. R. Rahman, Vijay and K. Balachandar all attending. The film featured Dhanu's son, Kalaprabhu, in his debut as director whilst Shanthnoo Bhagyaraj, son of noted actor K. Bhagyaraj, was selected to portray the lead role. The film was initially described as a "candy floss love story with a city subject" and was set to feature Ishita Sharma and Sivi in other lead roles, although Sivi was later replaced by Vedhika. During the making of "Sakkarakatti", cinematographer Andrew left the project as his dates clashed with a prior commitment with a Hindi film and was duly replaced by cinematographer Raja.

A song with graphics arranged by Soundarya Rajinikanth's Ocher Studios was shot in May 2007 at a cost of 35 lakh rupees, with the producer then exclaiming that "the song will be the talk of the town" when released. The song "Taxi Taxi" was reshot following the enormous response from the audience after the audio release.

"Sakkarakatti" opened alongside Sun Pictures' "Kadhalil Vizhunthen" at the box office on 26 September 2008 with the media hyping that it was a battle of two films with debutants and successful soundtracks.

Behindwoods cited : "Shanthanu has to play a thinly sketched hero, but he puts energy and charm into everything he does. He is more than promising- he's star material, and he’ll survive this wreck. The debuting heroine, Ishita Sharma, is unimpressive. The second heroine, Vedhika, dances well and at least has some screen presence. ", while Sify said: "Shantanoo has that star quality to him which is so rare to find these days. But he is wasted in a role in which he just romance his heroines and dances", Nowrunning said: "Shanthanoo is fairly convincing as a cool college dude who metro audiences would love. He has not much to do beyond hanging out with his friends and cuddling the two heroines. Though the young hero seems bubbly, Prabhu is not able to tap his potential. Vedhika steals the show with her excellent performance as a jealous "morai penn' out to defeat the other girl. Her face-off with the hero in the climax deserves a big hand. ".

The score and soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman and the album was released on 12 July 2008. Initially Rahman was reluctant to compose the music for "Sakkarakatti" citing he was busy with other projects, but the director asked if Rahman could recycle songs from his Hindi films and he agreed. Rahman reused "Chinnamma Chilakkamma" and "Yeh Rishta" from "" as "Chinnamma Chilakamma" and "Naan Eppodhu." Haza happens to be the alter-ego of singer Chinmayee as per her blog. A reviewer from Indiaglitz.com stated that ""Sakkarakatti" is truly as sweet as sugar candy" in regard to the soundtrack.

Sangamam

Sangamam () is a 1999 Tamil-language musical film co written and directed by Suresh Krissna and produced by V. Natarajan of Pyramid Films. The film featured Rahman and newcomer Vindhya in the lead roles with Manivannan, Vijayakumar, Radharavi, and Vadivelu playing other important roles. The film's music was composed by A. R. Rahman, while Saravanan handled the cinematography. The film was released in 1999 but despite the award-winning soundtracks and rave reviews, the film became a financial failure.

This film depicts the disputes between two forms of the dance styles and music, Classical Indian (in particular Carnatic music and Bharathanatyam danceform) against rural Tamil folk music and dance. The film depicts the misunderstanding and mutual ignorance of the two factions. The parallel plot in the movie is of the children and intended successors of the respective dance doyens falling in love with each other. The climax ends with a consensus of both the music genres as well as the young couple, hence the name Sangamam.

V. Natarajan launched a film to be directed by Suresh Krishna and A. R. Rahman was signed on to compose the music for the film in early 1998, while he was also working with the producer Natarajan in "Rhythm" and "Udhaya". In an interview in August 1998, A. R. Rahman revealed that he was working on " a very small budget movie called "Sangamam" which is based on classical and folk dance". The film would feature his namesake and co-brother, Malayalam actor Rahman in the lead role with newcomer Vindhya roped in to play the lead female role.

During production it was reported that the film would be a remake of the 1968 film "Thillaanaa Mohanambal" which starred Sivaji Ganesan and Padmini, but this was subsequently found to be untrue. The film was briefly delayed in 1999 as A. R. Rahman was too busy to complete the background score for the film, with producer V. Natarajan initially refusing to pay him, causing further delays for the producer's next venture, "Rhythm".

The film's music was composed by A. R. Rahman. The music album of this also made news for the first time rapport of the veteran musician M. S. Viswanathan pairing up with A. R. Rahman. The soundtracks also boasts of prominent singers like S. Janaki, Hariharan, Unni Krishnan, Nithyasree Mahadevan, Sujatha and Shankar Mahadevan. The soundtrack features 6 songs composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics by Vairamuthu. The soundtrack received critical acclaim and Rahman won the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Music Director for the soundtrack he composed.The song "Mudhal Murai Killipparthaein" is composed in Bihag ragam won a national award for lyricist Vairamuthu

The film opened to mixed reviews with a critic writing that "Sangamam is a credible movie with good music by A. R. Rahman and superlative performance by Manivannan". The critic added that "Rahman does justice to his role and has brought a certain dignity and understatement to his character" but that "Vindhya, the heroine is the only weak link". Sandya of Indolink.com mentioned to "see it for the songs, like it for the songs, forget the movie", labelling that Vindhya "couldn't act for nuts". "New Straits Times" wrote "You should see this movie if you like A. R. Rahman's music. It makes for a pleasant viewing". The film was also set to be dubbed and released in Telugu under the same name, but the financial losses suffered had deterred the version.

Due to commercial failure, Sun TV, who bought the satellite rights of the film, premiered within one month after its release that too it was running in few theaters. Few of the Tamil movies like "Mugam", "Kadhal FM" have been telecast in sun tv, while it was running in theaters itself. The music of the film was critically acclaimed and won several awards in 2000.

Her grandmother (Leela Naidu) is so overwhelmed by grief that Ana's engagement is put on hold indefinitely (along with everything else) while granny tries to contact the spirit of her dead husband using her maid Milagrinia as her medium. But her wires get crossed each time and instead of grandpa, she brings forth ghosts of people the family has wronged in the past. Meanwhile, Ana's real love (Dalip Tahil), a pro-Portuguese anarchist, is hiding out in the cellar. As Ana's marriage to Erasmo draws near, she faints dead away because (as he soon finds out) she is pregnant, but not by him. Ruiz was also pursuing Ana who never reciprocates the same. However, Ruiz impregnates Milagrinia Nina Gupta. Ana elopes with the love of her life leaving a letter and later is revealed that is settled in Portugal with husband and her child whom she names after her grandfather. Milagrinia also gives birth to a baby and is later married to and old man from another village.

Agneepath (1990 film)

Agneepath (English: "The Path of Fire") is a 1990 Indian action-drama film directed by Mukul Anand. It stars Amitabh Bachchan as the protagonist Vijay Deenanath Chavan along with Mithun Chakraborty, Madhavi, Neelam Kothari, Rohini Hattangadi and Danny Denzongpa as the antagonist Kancha Cheena. The film was produced by Yash Johar.

The title was taken from a poem of the same name called 'Agneepath' which was penned by Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Amitabh's father, and which is recited at the beginning of the movie and creates a thematic link that continues through the movie, particularly in the climax, both literally and metaphorically.

Agneepath has grown into a strong cult film over the years. It is considered a milestone in Bachchan's career, and in the league of his all-time great movies. Amitabh Bachchan received his first National Film Award for Best Actor at the 38th National Film Awards for his performance. Mithun Chakraborty received the Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award. The film, despite being the tenth highest-grosser of 1990, had collections way below its high budget, and thus, the film recorded as "flop" at the box-office. The film was remade in 2012 with the same title, by Johar's son Karan Johar, as a tribute to his father. This movie seems to have some inspiration from 1983 Alpacino hit movie “Scarface”.

Much-loved village schoolmaster Deenanath Chauhan (Alok Nath) strongly opposes the plans of Kancha Cheena, an underworld don (Danny Dengzongpa) and his band of gangsters to set up a base for heroin smuggling. After being discredited in a set-up scandal and lynched by the manipulated villagers, his family is evicted and made destitute much to Cheena's advantage. Swearing revenge after his father's murder and the attempted rape of his mother Suhasini Chavan (Rohini Hattangadi) go unpunished, and with a burning desire to clear his father's name, his son Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) takes on the responsibilities of caring for his mother and sister Siksha (Neelam) that, by a strange twist of fate, cause him to become a gangster in his own right. Working his way up the ladder and attaining notoriety as an underworld kingpin, Vijay suffers an assassination attempt by fellow gangsters after he refuses to co-operate with their drug-smuggling operations. Left to die, he is discovered by Krishnan Iyer M.A. (Mithun Chakraborty) who transports him to hospital and saves his life, and who eventually finds employment as Siksha's bodyguard. During his time in hospital, Vijay is cared for by Nurse Mary Matthew (Madhavi).

Vijay avenges his assassination attempt by killing his killers one by one, but his mother strongly disapproves of his murderous and gangster tendencies and drives him away from home after chastising him for dirtying the good name of his father. Vijay, hurt and upset, seeks solace in Mary's arms and begins a relationship with her. Siksha is then kidnapped and held in a slum by a gangster who wants to avenge the death of his associates killed by Vijay, and an unsuccessful rescue attempt by Krishnan ends up with the two of them brawling. Vijay hears of this and arrives to kill the gangster in a fit of rage. But this close encounter between Krishnan and Siksha causes a growing intimacy between the two of them and they fall in love with each other. Vijay is outraged and strongly protests against the relationship to his mother, but is rebuffed again when his mother disowns him a second time and considers Krishnan her "good son". Stung and deeply hurt by this slight, he again seeks solace in Mary and later marries her and resolves to do things "in the right way" to gain his mother's favour.

After cutting a deal with Kancha Cheena to allow him access into his old village, Vijay sets in motion a number of strategies that undercut Cheena's criminal operations and gain him the legal ownership of the village. Revenge is a dish best served cold as Vijay informs Cheena of his identity as the son of Dinanath Chavan, lands Cheena in jail and arranges for Cheena's associates to testify against him in court. Vijay returns the village to his mother and finds himself back in her favour, but Cheena ensures his release by arranging for the witnesses to be gunned down and Vijay's family to be kidnapped and held hostage. This is the last straw for Vijay who is forced to return to his criminal ways and to walk the "Path of Fire" in order to rescue them. An almighty struggle takes place as Cheena bombs every building and demolishes the whole village before he is killed by Vijay's bare hands. But Vijay does not survive; he dies of a bullet wound in the lap of his mother at the site of his old house. His mother realises that everything Vijay had done until then had been for the ultimate purpose of restoring the good name of Dinanath Chavan, and she weeps over his body piteously along with Krishnan, Siksha and Mary.


A characteristic feature of the movie was the dark undertones and the grim atmosphere of the film, which was unusual for any of Amitabh Bachchan's films. It was noted that the film was "grim" due to the protagonist, Vijay Chavan's bloodlust and ferocity. The film utilised a lot of dark distortions in the imagery, which were a common theme in some Gangster Films. Mithun Chakraborty's unique role of Krishnan Iyer was inspired by one of his roommates of his struggling days, before he became a popular film star. In his struggling days Chakraborty used to be room sharing with Devio who used to pay 150 Rupees while Chakraborty Used to pay 75 Rupees. Devio had the a bed while Chakraborty used to sleep on the floor, one specific time Chakraborty used his bed whilst he was at work and when Devio came back he scolded Chakraborty. This incident remained with Chakraborty and he put Devio's character on screen. Tinnu Anand, who played the role of the Village Drunkard, shaved his head to obtain the age difference between him and Amitabh Bachchan. The film was shot extensively in Bombay in several locations such as Andheri, Goregaon, and Colaba. The locations and the photography drew positive feedback from critics.

When released, Agneepath was a failure, both at the box office as well as among the critics. However, Karan Johar recounts in an interview how younger city based audiences thought it was a cool film. "Over the top, inane songs", dialogues "veering towards melodrama" and, more importantly, Amitabh Bachchan's experimentation with his voice did not go well with the masses and the critics alike. Film Trade Analyst Komal Nahta wrote thus about Bachchan's voice, : "But the biggest undoing of the film is Amitabh Bachchan’s voice. He has spoken the dialogue in a different voice (inspired by Marlon Brando in The Godfather) which will not be accepted by the audience. Further the mixing not being clear, his dialogues are incomprehensible at places." He further wrote that the film lacked a gripping drama, well-set script, and that even the murder scenes lacked excitement. Satish Naidu in his review noted that the narrative had a slow pace in the last hour. Another fact that worked against the advantage of the film was its weak story. Rediff's review of Agneepath suggested that perhaps, the grim, violent, aggressive and dark portrayal of the underbelly of Bombay's underworld had worked against the film.

However, the National Award for the best actor being bestowed on Amitabh Bachchan changed the perspective in which the film was appreciated. Over the years, favourable reviews trickling in made Agneepath a cult classic. Currently, Agneepath has been rated 7.7 on a scale of 10 in the Internet Movie Database by 7,555 users. In review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 715 user ratings favour the movie. Sanjay Dutt, the actor who plays Kancha Cheena's role in the remake praised the film saying that it was well ahead of its time when asked about the original film- : "I loved the original film and if I was the whole of audience, I would have made it a big hit. I think may be the film was too ahead of times. Mukul is a brilliant director and his vision was so much ahead of his time."
Satish Naidu commented in his blog that Agneepath's direction, camera work and cinematography "had some serious physicality going for the film[there]". He further drove home his opinion, describing the betrayal of a certain "undeveloped terrain below" by the jagged, staccato-like movements of the camera work. Further, Mr.Naidu praised the way in which Mukul Anand portrayed Amitabh Bachchan in the film. An interesting aspect of the film was its cinematography, handled by Pravin Bhatt, which has been described as "marvelous" due to the "beautiful scenes shot in Mauritius. The ship bombing scene was executed well, and that the portrayal of the picturesque scenery of trees and fields in full bloom (in the songs, especially) met with rave reviews. Movie Reviewer Peter Nepstad in his blog, the "Illuminated Lantern" wrote that:
The movie's review in Rediff.com, mentioned that: "Agneepath, despite its amplified sentimentality, strong language and violence works on account of this very dynamism. "

According to trade website Box Office India, the gross collection of the movie was Rs 10,25,00,000, way below the film's budget and so despite being among the top grossers of the year the film was a flop.

The film featured great background music, but songs were rather not exciting. Rather unusually, for a Bollywood film of the time, a West African track was used in the film. Guinean singer Mory Kanté's hit Yé ké yé ké appears in the film, but is not on the soundtrack. The lyrics were penned by Anand Bakshi.

In an interview with The Times of India, Karan Johar explained that he had the intention of remaking the original Agneepath ever since the film released 22 years ago, because according to him, the failure of the film broke his father's heart. The idea of the remake materialised on the sets of Johar's film "My Name Is Khan" in which Karan Malhotra was an associate director. Johar told Malhotra his desire to remake the original film and asked him to revisit it again, to which he agreed immediately.

Hrithik Roshan played the lead role of Vijay Deenanath Chauhan and Sanjay Dutt plays the role of the antagonist Kancha Cheena. Priyanka Chopra was the female lead. The character of Krishnan Iyer played by Mithun Chakraborty in the original was removed and Rishi Kapoor played a newly introduced negative character, Rauf Lala. Other members of the cast include Om Puri and Zarina Wahab among others.

Shooting of the film mostly took place in Diu and Mumbai's film city. Originally slated for release on 20 January, "Agneepath" was postponed by a week to 26 January 2012. Unlike the original, the remake opened to positive responses from critics and the audience. "Agneepath" collected Rs 217.5 million (US$4.34 million) on the opening day. According to review aggregator Review Gang, professional critics have given the film a rating of 6.5 stars out of 10. The film did fantastic business at the box office and entered the 100 crore club.

The film was also modified and remade in Tamil as Sivasakthi, starring Sathyaraj and Prabhu Ganesan directed by Suresh Krissna.

Vetrimaaran who earlier worked as an assistant to Balu Mahendra, prepared a script for Dhanush, who was the lead hero of the films he worked in, and Dhanush immediately accepted the offer after hearing the story. The film titled "Desiya Nedunchalai 47" was initially launched with Yuvan Shankar Raja as the music director and Ekambaram as the cinematographer. After he found trouble finding producers with A. M. Rathnam and Salem Chandrasekhar leaving the project after initial interest, Dhanush's sister Dr. Vimala Geetha agreed to produce the film, but she also dropped the film. Dhanush's father Kasthuri Raja finally agreed to produce the film and Kirat Bhattal was signed as heroine, while Harris Jayaraj was selected as music director. However, after two days of shoot the film was shelved and Dhanush opted to pursue other films after the surprise success of his "Thiruvilayadal Arambam". The film's collapse saw Vetrimaaran approach producer Kadiresan and narrated to him the stories he had prepared but the producer did not like "Desiya Nedunchaalai 47", but agreed to work on another project titled "Polladhavan".

Vetrimaaran has since described that he had "ample time" for his production works of "Polladhavan" as "Dhanush had confidence in him". Production designer Durai helped him rope in G. V. Prakash Kumar to score the film's music, while Dhanush also recommended cinematographer Velraj to Vetrimaaran after the pair had worked together in "Parattai Engira Azhagu Sundaram". Vetrimaaran chose Kannada language actor Kishore to make his Tamil film debut after his assistant gave him rave reviews of the actor's performance in the unfinished Prashanth-starrer "Petrol". The team held test shoots with both Kajal Aggarwal and Poonam Bajwa for the film and released the stills to the media, but Vetrimaaran was still unsatisfied and finished two schedules before finalising on Divya Spandana. The director revealed that there was initially an issue with the actress after she got offended by his words and did not come for the shoot for three days, before Durai intervened. The film's story was inspired partly by the lost bike of his friend Andrew and the variety of experiences he had tracking down his vehicle. Vetrimaaran revealed that when he wrote the script, he made many changes to suit the visual medium and for Dhanush on his physical attributes while playing an action hero. When questioned about its relevance to "Bicycle Thieves", he stated that it "is a disgrace to "Bicycle Thieves" if it is compared with "Polladhavan"".

The critic from Sify.com stating that "Vetri has made his mentor proud, and his style of narration and takings are very similar to the ace director "Balu Mahendra". The reviewer from The Hindu stated that "at no point does "Polladhavan" sag and that writer-director Vetrimaran has slogged through his screenplay and the result shows." Nowrunning wrote:"'Polladavan' is a typical Dhanush flick, which is not even distantly related to Rajinikanth's "Polladavan." The script is obviously tailor-made for Dhanush but it is no different from gangster movies, which make audiences feel jaded".


Polladhavan was remade in Kannada as "Punda" and in Telugu as "Kurradu" starring Varun Sandesh but it could not repeat the success of the original version. It was remade in Sinhala as "Pravegeya".This film was also remade in Bengali film Borbaad (2014) directed by Raj Chakraborty with debutant Bonny Senguta and Rittika sen and in Hindi as "Guns of Banaras".

The soundtrack consisted of five song, three of them composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar, while rapper Yogi B and Dhina composed each one track. The song "Engeyum Eppodhum" is a remix of the same-titled song from the 1979 film "Ninaithale Inikkum". Responding to allegations that the song "Minnalgall Koothadum" was a rip-off of Akon's Smack That, Prakash Kumar stated "I may have been inspired but I did not just copy that song".

The film released on 26 October 2000 and was a Super hit at the box office. This film is the Tamil remake of the 1996 Telugu film "Pavitra Bandham" starring Daggubati Venkatesh and Soundarya.

Viswanathan (S. P. Balasubrahmanyam) is a rich industrialist whose only son is Vijay (Vijay). Vijay returns from abroad after education and is heavily influenced by the Western culture and prefers to enjoy the life instead of getting married and managing businesses. Viswanthan plans to get Vijay married so that he will become responsible in life. But to his shock, Vijay agrees for marriage provided that the marriage should be valid only for one year beyond which it is to be decided by Vijay. Viswanthan worries as no girl will be ready to accept for such a kind of agreement and then explains his situation to his personal secretary Priya (Simran) and requests her to marry Vijay, as Priya is more responsible and matured. Viswanthan believes that if Priya gets married to Vijay, then there are chances that Vijay's character will get changed.

Priya hesitates initially, but she is the only breadwinner for her poor family. She has to look after her mother, elder sister who needs a heart surgery, younger sister who needs to get married, and brother who is jobless. So she decides to sacrifice her life for her family's sake and agrees to marry Vijay, accepting the agreement. Vijay and Priya become good friends after marriage. Vijay gets to know about the money siphoning made by his office employees Manohar (Thalaivasal Vijay) and 7 Times (Kazan Khan). He dismisses them and lodges a complaint with police following which they both get arrested. They decide to kill Vijay and plan for an accident. Vijay gets injured and Priya takes care of him very well, following which he recovers.

On the day of their first wedding anniversary, to everyone's surprise, Vijay says that his marriage life has ended as per agreement and drops Priya at her home. Priya gets deeply hurt by Vijay's behaviour. One day, Vijay sees a beggar in a traffic signal carrying his physically challenged wife on his back and begging. Hence Vijay realizes his mistake, learns the Eastern (Indian) culture and feels guilty that even a beggar takes care of his wife well which he did not. So Vijay rushes back to Priya's home and calls her back. But Priya refuses to come with Vijay as she is hurt by his behavior.

Priya gets employed with a new company. On knowing this, Vijay takes over that company to woo Priya. But Priya does not talk to Vijay in office. Priya gets pregnant and a baby shower function is organized by Priya's family for which Vijay and Viswanathan are invited. During the function, in front of her new colleagues, Priya insults Vijay by revealing that he is her husband and he left her after a year as per the agreement. Vijay retaliates immediately that even Priya married him knowing about the agreement is only because she needed money for her elder sister's operation, younger sister's wedding, job securement for her brother. Vijay accuses that Priya utilized his wealth to improve her family's ailing situation and leaves the place.

Vijay and his friends now plan to play a trick to impress Priya. They decide to lie to Priya that Vijay is stabbed by his ex-employees whom he had sent to jail before so that Priya will change her mind and unite with Vijay. Priya comes to know about Vijay and his friends’ plan and she goes to meet Vijay and scold him for his plans. But things take a turn where Manohar and 7 Tens really escape from jail and stab Vijay. Now Priya knows that Vijay's condition is really serious and rushes to save him, but she slips and falls down and is unable to move as her delivery date is due. Vijay manages to bear his pain and takes Priya to a hospital where both get admitted and treated. Priya gives birth to a baby boy while Vijay's life is also saved.

The film is a remake of Muthyala Subbiah's 1996 Telugu film, "Pavithra Bandham", which featured Venkatesh and Soundarya in the lead roles. It was also made in Hindi as "Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rehte Hain" in 1999, with Satish Kaushik directing Anil Kapoor and Kajol. Vivek was signed to play a comic role in the film and wrote his scenes. Vijay's son, Jason Sanjay, was born during a schedule of the film with Vijay unable to attend his birth. Singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam reprised his role as the hero's father from the original.

The film teamed up with Coca-Cola for their publicity campaign after Vijay had signed on to the soft drink company as a brand ambassador.

A reviewer labelled it as "a clean family entertainer that with its Indian culture-versus foreign culture theme would appeal to family audiences" and mentioned that "the script is cleverly crafted", and that "Vijay neatly underplayed his role with Simran as the perfect foil." The film won particular praise for Simran's portrayal of her character. She won Cinema Express Award for Best Actress – Tamil and nominated for Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Tamil, with her dubbing artist Savitha Reddy securing the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Female Dubbing Artist .

Professor Kurian Fernandez (Nedumudi Venu), a convict, escapes from jail along with Raghu (Ganesh Kumar), his cell mate. After a failed attempt to chase and nab the duo, the officials draw up several plans to capture both. Police authorities strongly feel that Fernandez will land up in Bangalore and may try to meet up with his only daughter. Unnikrishnan (Mohanlal) and K. Purushothaman Nair (Jagadish), two inspectors from Kerala Police, are sent to Bangalore to follow the activities of Gaadha (Girija Shettar), daughter of Fernandez. Upon reaching Bangalore, Unnikrishnan meets Peter (Mukesh), his college mate, who is also now an inspector with Karnataka Police. Unnikrishnan and Peter make up a team and sideline Purushothaman Nair, who struggles hard to cope up with Kannada language. The police team stays at a room just opposite to where Gaadha stays as a paying guest. Gaadha, working at an advertisement agency as a copy writer is staying along with Maggie Aunty (Sukumari), who is constantly in a fight with her son (Kuthiravattom Pappu). Unnikrishnan and Peter, who are born flirts, are more interested in drinking and playing cards than investigating. K. P. Nair tries to report this to the authorities, but fails in getting both in control. Unnikrishnan slowly develops a crush towards Gaadha, which gets transformed into a full-fledged passion, but Gaadha never accepts it. Unni befriends Maggie aunty and tries all ways to woo Gaadha. Meanwhile, Unni and Peter finds out that Fernandez is in the city and is constantly in touch with Gaadha. The police commissioner (M. G. Soman) is in all efforts to nab Fernandez. Unnikrishnan decides to use Gaadha to reach out to Fernandez. Gaadha reveals to Unni about the past of Fernandez, when he was a college professor, who was loved and cared for by the students. The sincere professor questioned the college authorities on many administration malpractices, which made him a dust in their eyes. The sons of the local Member of Indian Parliament (Janardhanan (actor)), who was corrupt and the police commissioner were punished by the professor, which led to a serious fracas in college and authorities were forced to take action on them under severe protests from students. In retaliation, they and their friends attacked professor Fernandez while he was traveling with a female student after a college event in the night. The girl was raped and later committed suicide and the professor was falsely convicted in the case. Now, the professor is out of jail to avenge on it. Unnikrishnan tries to convince the professor with the help of Gaadha, but he fails to give up. Meanwhile, an elderly and wealthy businessman (Thikkurissi Sukumaran Nair), who is a client of the ad agency, where Gaadha works, likes her and asks her to join him as his secretary abroad. Gaadha, who had by then developed a soft feeling towards Unni, lets him bring his mother (Kaviyoor Ponnamma) to see her to fix their marriage. At the same time, The professor succeeds in killing the sons of the commissioner and the M.P, as well as their dishonest lawyer (Cochin Haneefa), who had fabricated the professor in the rape case. The Commissioner orders "shoot at sight" at Fernandez. The professor loses mental stability and decides to plant a bomb at the city stadium, which might kill hundreds of civilians. Raghu parts ways with the professor as a result of the latter's deteriorating mental equilibrium, but is shot dead by him when he decides to foil his plan of bombing the stadium by revealing it to the police. Unnikrishnan asks Gaadha to make her father give up this heinous plan, but he refuses. That evening, Fernandez plants the bombs in the stadium, but the police team under Unnikrishnan corners him and takes him to the tower. The professor, despite repeated requests, refuses to explain how to defuse the bomb. But Unnikrishnan successfully defuses the bomb, thereby saving the lives of hundreds. In the stampede and chaos that had ensued in the stadium amongst the spectators of the football match after the news of the bombs had been leaked, a revengeful Fernandez stabs the M.P to death, and is finally captured back by the police. Unnikrishnan safely and successfully rescues Gaadha from the police, who had captured her on the orders of the commissioner who wanted to take revenge from Fernandez for killing the former's son. To save her from the future actions of the commissioner, Unni and Gaadha decide to leave for Kerala together to get married. But due to their ill-fate, Gaadha, who actually wanted to join with Unni, couldn't join with him and decides to go with the old man to London.

The only trademark he remembers from it is a mole which is situated next to her navel (bellybutton). He then becomes determined in looking for his "dream girl" with the help of his uncle (Manivannan) and brothers-in-law (Charle and Halwa Vasu). On the other hand, his father arranges him to get married to a village girl named Savithri (Devayani), which Gokul (often referred to as "Mapillai") objects to, but Savithri loves him. Gokul later sees his dream girl, Swapna (Rambha), at a wedding where he spots the mole on her navel. He then sings to her, impressing her, but she leaves abruptly. He later sees her at a music class which he teaches, and from then on, they love each other.

Kannukkul Nilavu

Kannukkul Nilavu (English: "The Moon in My Eyes") is a 2000 Indian Tamil-language romantic psychological thriller film written and directed by Fazil. The film features Vijay, Shalini and Kaveri in the leading roles, while Raghuvaran, Srividya and Ponvannan play other supporting roles. It was Vijay's 25th film and his first film of the new 2000s millennium. In 2017, the film was dubbed into Hindi as "My Duty" by WAM India Movies.

The film is about a person who suffers from a neurological condition that results in partial retrograde amnesia and delusions due to a head injury and his subsequent recovery thanks to a kind girl and her psychiatrist father.

The film opens to Gautham Prabhakar (Vijay) searching all around Pondicherry in vain for a girl named Gayathri. He encounters a group of friends headed by Hema (Shalini) and requests their help in locating Gayathri, who appears to be Gautham's lover. The group members are initially hostile to him but eventually decide to help him after Gautham pursues them aggressively and Hema realizes that he may be suffering from a neurological condition resulting in amnesia and delusions. Hema's father Dr. Rajashekar (Raghuvaran) is a psychiatrist who discovers Gautham's real condition and the dangers it poses.

It is revealed that Gautham was actually a musicologist. About six months earlier, he had traveled to a hill resort in Tamil Nadu for his research on musical patterns in the sounds of nature. While in that trip, he encountered three men - Prakash (Shajin), Soundar (Ponvannan), and Shanmugam (Thalaivasal Vijay) - who all hailed from Pondicherry. Gayathri (Kaveri) was a local girl who was teased frequently by the three men. Gayathri regularly ran up to Gautham to seek refuge from the men's pursuits. Then, one day, the three men got drunk and began molesting Gayathri. Hearing her screams, Gautham and his friend Balaji attempted to rescue Gayathri. In the ensuing fight, Balaji's knee was struck with an axe, Gayathri dropped unconscious, and Gautham was hit hard on the head with the blunt end of the axe. The way Gautham remembers it is - the three men had molested and murdered Gayathri and then had left Gautham for dead after striking him on the head. Gautham, in his hypnotic state, swears furiously to Rajashekar that he will avenge Gayathri's murder by capturing and killing the three men responsible. As it is revealed later in the film, Gayathri had not died but had merely passed out.

Rajasekhar explains to Hema and her friends the reason why Gautham kept viewing Gayathri as his lover in his delusional state, even though she actually had no relationship with Gautham and he was merely trying to be a Good Samaritan. He also explains that if Gautham was treated and his memories brought back, then it could potentially create a new Gautham, a violent and aggressive one, who goes on a killing spree. Unable to make a decision on the next step forward, on Hema's suggestion, they decide to delay any action until Gautham's mother (Srividya) arrived from Malaysia. It is revealed through intermittent scenes that the mother, having not had contact with her son in all of the previous six months, is already out of her home, searching desperately for her son in India.

Until the mother arrived, the kind Hema takes care of Gautham. Gautham, for unknown reasons, becomes fond of Hema and believes deeply that Hema is the only person who can help him, and in return Hema also begins to develop feelings of affection and love towards him. Hema even wonders if it would be possible to bring Gautham back to normal by showing him enough care and affection that he forgets about Gayathri altogether. This strategy fails, as once the mother arrives, Gautham's past memories come flooding back to him and he turns into a reckless revenge-seeker, terrorizing both his mother and Hema, and swearing to kill the three men who had supposedly murdered Gayathri.

The remainder of the film is about how Hema and Gautham's mother put up with the new villainous Gautham, while Rajashekar devises and implements an ingenious plan to cure him. Rajashekar manages to contact the three men, who reveal the truth - Gayathri was still alive. The three men are innocent, and the only terrible mistake they had done was drunkenly striking Gautham on the head, resulting in this whole mess. While Gautham manages to capture Prakash and Soundar for his revenge, Rajashekar and Shanmugam manage to trick him successfully into entering Gayathri's current home by giving him a chase. Gautham is initially dumbstruck at seeing Gayathri still alive, but then reality eventually sinks into him, and he is cured completely. He apologizes to his mother, Shanmugam, and Hema for his torturous acts, reveals the location where he held the other two men captive, and profusely thanks Rajashekar and Hema for their efforts. Hema looks on sadly as she wonders if this is the last she would see of him. Rajashekar senses this and gives a non-verbal consent for Gautham to take his daughter with him. Hema is overjoyed and the two, along with Gautham's mother, drive back.

Mohan Natarajan brought together the team of the successful 1997 film, "Kadhalukku Mariyadhai", in director Fazil and leading pair Vijay and Shalini with the venture. Anandakuttan was signed on to handle the camera and Ilaiyaraja to compose the music, while Shekar took charge of the editing, while the art direction was handled by Mani Suchitra. The filming took place in and around Chennai, Pondicherry, Krishnapatnam Harbour, Vizag Harbour, Tuticorin Harbour, Alappuzha, Kochi and the hilly area of Wagamon.

The film was released on 14 January 2000. Kannukkul Nilavu opened to positive reviews with "The Hindu" claiming that it was a "tremendous comeback vehicle for Vijay, wherein he portrays an entire gamut of emotions". The reviewer added that the film was "subtle in scenic presentation and characterisation, suspense without melodrama and spontaneity in reactions are plusses", while mentioning that Shalini was "flawless" in her role. Rediff.com described it as a "film worth seeing", labelling that "the highlight of the film is actor Vijay's power-packed performance". The critic described that the "actor has shown laudable skill both in the way he has handled this complicated role and in expressing various shades of Gautham's tormented mind. Especially from the moment he becomes aggressive, with the violent streak predominating and eyes blazing with manic fury." K. N. Vijiyan of "New Straits Times" noted that the film "offers something different from usual love stories and should appease Vijay's fans".

Cinematographer Ananda Kuttan won the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Cinematographer for his work in the film. The film was awarded with a clean 'U' certificate by the Indian Censor Board. The satellite rights of the film were purchased by Sun TV.

The film's score and soundtrack is composed by Ilaiyaraaja, while lyrics written by Palani Bharathi. Although he did not sing any of the songs in this film, Vijay did playback sing brief snippets of “Iravu Pagalai Theda” and “Chinnanchiru Kiliye” in two scenes.

Thulladha Manamum Thullum

Thulladha Manamum Thullum () is a 1999 Indian Tamil-language romantic drama film directed by debutant Ezhil. The film stars Vijay and Simran, while Manivannan, Dhamu and Vaiyapuri among others play supporting roles. The film, produced by R. B. Choudary, has its score and soundtrack composed by S. A. Rajkumar and cinematography performed by R. Selva. The film received positive reviews and ran for more than 200 days at the Tamil Nadu box office, eventually becoming a commercial success. The film also won two awards at Tamil Nadu State Film Awards with Simran winning Best Actress and Vijay wining the MGR honorary award.

The film begins with Kutty (Vijay) waiting at the Pune rail station for the train back to Chennai. As he continues to wait, he tears off a paper scrap from a pillar that reveals a carving of the name "Rukmani". The train arrives and Kutty boards a cabin that is boarded by college students from Chennai who are musicians. During the train journey, Kutty starts singing "Innisai Paadivarum", which catches the attention of everyone and they all begin to sing along with him. After finishing the song, the students applaud Kutty for his singing and ask him whether he's a professional musician and his reason for coming to Pune. Kutty denies this and reveals that he's an ex-convict, having been released from jail after 8 years. When asked why he was imprisoned for so long, Kutty explains the reason for his conviction as the film goes for a flashback.

Kutty is an aspiring singer while working as a local cable provider run by Mani (Manivannan) in Chennai. His songs are appreciated by a college student Rukmani alias 'Rukku' (Simran) and she wishes to meet him. But every time they meet, circumstances place Kutty in situations where Rukku dismisses him as a rowdy, unaware that the person she hates and is accusing of being a rowdy is the same person whom she admires. Kutty learns about Rukku's admiration for him and tries to reveal his identity to her, but he still ends up in situations that portray him as a transgressive element. One day while chasing after a pickpocket who stole his wallet, Kutty ends up in Rukku's college where he locates the pickpocket at the other side of a lab room that Rukku happens to be in. Kutty runs into the lab room in front of Rukku, and accidentally knocks over a flask containing reactive chemicals that fall into the ground, causing Rukku to go blind. Kutty doesn't learn about Rukku's loss of sight until one rainy day, when he sees her and tries to reveal his identity.

After learning that he became the cause for Rukku's blindness, Kutty is wracked with guilt and decides to devote himself to her from then onwards attending to her every need. Kutty begins to fall in love with Rukku and he regularly writes to his mother about the development of love he has for her. Rukku in turn learns to respect and love Kutty too, thinking that he is the singer she admires and not knowing that he is the same person she thought was a rowdy and the one who caused her eyesight loss. When Kutty's mother dies - much to his grief - she offers her eyes to Rukku. To meet the cost of the eye transplant, Kutty offers his kidney to a Pune-based rich man and travels to Pune with Rukku promising that she will never forget him and will wait for him to return. While at the Pune rail station waiting for the train back to Chennai, Kutty carves Rukku's name on one of the pillars (the same carving that was seen in the beginning of the film). Unfortunately, Kutty is arrested by the police after unknowingly agreeing to look after the luggage - which turned out to contain explosives - of another man.

Back in the present day, the students ask Kutty whether he was able to get in touch with Rukku during the past 8 years to which Kutty replies he wasn't able to and misses her a lot. The students assure Kutty that he will find Rukku and wishes him the best of luck as the train arrives to Chennai. When Kutty arrives to the area he used to live, he finds that everything has changed during the past 8 years save for a shrine. While contemplating where Rukku might be and the changed environment around him, Kutty sees a passing ambassador car and finds that Rukku is riding in it. Kutty chases after the car while calling out to Rukku and ends up at a Collector's office where it is revealed that Rukku, who had studied for IAS, became a Collector. Kutty calls out to Rukku while being held by an officer whom he accidentally bumped into. However Rukku, having regained her eyesight, still thinks of Kutty as the rowdy who caused her eyesight loss and orders her officers to arrest him. A shocked Kutty is then knocked unconscious and dragged into the police jeep by the officers. As the jeep reaches the office gates, it collides with a rickshaw that happens to contain Kutty's father Mani. Finding Kutty at the back of the jeep and learning that Rukku gave the order to arrest him, Mani goes to the Collector's office entrance and angrily questions Rukku about Kutty's arrest. During the confrontation, a travelling bus full of people, who accompanied Kutty during his trip back from Pune, sing "Innisai Paadivarum". Rukku hears them and orders the officers to stop the bus chasing after it with Mani tailing behind. As Rukku boards the bus, she asks the passengers if any of them are Kutty. One of the students then reveals to Rukku that Kutty has come back from Pune and is looking for her. Just then Kutty, who regained consciousness and got out of the police jeep, begins singing "Innisai Paadivarum". Everyone hears him and runs towards him. As Kutty continues singing, Rukku realizes that the person who she accused of being a rowdy and accidentally caused her blindness and the person who she admired as a singer and took care of her when she was blind has been Kutty this whole time. After Kutty finishes singing, a guilt stricken Rukku expresses her joy of finally being able to meet him after so long and tearfully begs for his forgiveness. Kutty forgives her and the two reunite with each other.


The film saw director Ezhil, an erstwhile assistant to Robert-Rajashekhar, Panneer and Parthiban, make his debut as a film-maker under R. B. Choudary's production house. The film's concept was inspired from Charlie Chaplin starrer "City Lights" which Ezhil had watched during a film festival. Earlier version of the script showed Vijay's character as a painter. Initial title for the film was "Rukmanikkaga". But producer RB Chaudhary told the director that he "wanted a title like Paarthaal Pasi Theerum" and it was titled as "Thullatha Manamum Thullum".

Initially, Ezhil wanted comedian Vadivelu to play the lead role. Vadivelu, who was impressed with the story, has said to Ezhil that the story line was too good and he doesn't know whether it will work with him in the lead. Vadivelu also asked Ezhil to wait for six months, if he didn't get anyone hero then he will act in it then he was replaced by Vijay. On the suggestion of his friends, he decided to make it with a commercial hero and changed the entire script retaining only the emotional core of City Lights. Murali was also considered for the lead role before Vijay was selected. Prior to release, the role of Vijay's mother in the film was kept under wraps with the media speculating who would play the role. Eventually, no actress played the role although the character played a pivotal part in the film. Vijay took a pay cut for the film, accepting only 30 lakh instead of 50 lakh, as he had signed the film before the release of his film "Kadhalukku Mariyadhai". Rambha was initially supposed to do the project, but as the project underwent changes, the actress opted out before she was replaced by Simran.

The film’s shoot began with the "Dhuddu" song as the director felt it would give the team some time to gel. This was the first Vijay song which Raju Sundaram choreographed. The story takes place in Triplicane because Ezhil had lived there for a while in his uncle's house. The team scouted for long to find a suitable location that fit the story’s requirements however a chance visit to the set of a Malayalam film at Murugalaya Studios convinced Ezhil that erecting a set would be far more cost-effective and thus set resembling Triplicane was erected.

The soundtrack of the film was composed by S. A. Rajkumar, while lyrics were written by Vairamuthu and Muthu Vijayan. Rajkumar agreed to compose the music for this film after coming to know that Ezhil had assisted Robert-Rajasekaran, the duo who introduced him in films. 

The song "Meghamaai Vandhu" which was supposed to be the theme song of the film was inspired from Arabic song "Saiyoni" as Ezhil wanted Tamil version of it. But after the song was recorded, he came to know that Deva had used the same tune for "Salomiya" from "Kannedhirey Thondrinal". SA Rajkumar told him not to worry and gave him the tune of "Innisai Paadi Varum".

A critic from the Deccan Herald mentioned that "the experience of seeing the film is simply thrilling", mentioning that the success comes from "the naivete, the simplicity, the absolute lack of sophistication, and from the delightful hero (Vijay)".


Owing to its success, the film was remade in Kannada as "O Nanna Nalle", in Telugu as "Nuvvu Vastavani", in Bengali as "Sathi", in Odia as "I Love You" and in Bhojpuri "Pyar Jab Kenhu Se Hoi Jala" (2008).

The success of the film led to more offers for Simran, who with "Thulladha Manamum Thullum" and "Vaali", established herself among the leading actresses in Tamil films. Vijay and Simran were also paired together in several other films after the success of "Thulladha Manamum Thullum", with projects titled "Priyamanavale" and "Udhaya" launched weeks after this film's release.

Nilaave Vaa

Nilaave Vaa (English: "Oh moon, come to me") is a 1998 Indian Tamil-language romantic drama film directed by A. Venkatesh and produced by K. T. Kunjumon. The film stars Vijay and Suvalakshmi in the main lead roles, while Sanghavi, Raghuvaran and Manivannan play other supporting roles. The film opened in August 1998 to negative reviews and was declared as average at the box office. It was later dubbed in Hindi as "Ek Aur Sikander".

Siluvai (Vijay) is the son of Cruz (Vinu Chakravarthy). They are Christians living in a fishing village. In another town, Perumaal (Jaiganesh) is the father to Sangeetha (Suvalakshmi) and Gauri. Sangeetha comes to the small fishing village. Siva (Raghuvaran) is proposed (and later engaged) to marry her. However, Gauri falls in love with Siva's friend, and after hearing that Perumal does not want to accept the Hindu-Christian marriage, she decides to elope with her lover. This leads to the breakup of Sangeetha and Siluvai's love affair. However, Siva, upon hearing Siluvai's story, gives a great speech to the villagers and unites Siluvai and Sangeetha.

This low-budget production was jointly produced on Vijay's home banner and K T Kunjumon who was still reeling under the failure of "Ratchagan". Initially Rakshana was signed on as heroine but was subsequently replaced by Suvalakshmi. Mansoor Ali Khan had signed to be the villain in "Nilaave Vaa", but the actor later returned the advance of 50,000 and took back his 40 days of call sheets, with Anantharaj consequently replacing him.

A critic from Indolink.com concluded that the film was "not impressive", while mentioning that "Vijay rocked as usual" and that Raghuvaran "has given a good performance as usual". Vijay mentioned that he had expected the film to do good business, but its box office earnings were average.

The film score and the soundtrack were composed by film composer Vidyasagar. The lyrics were written by Vairamuthu. The songs proved to be successful, despite the average performance of the film.

Kadhal Sadugudu

Kadhal Sadugudu is a 2003 Indian Tamil-language romantic drama film written and directed by Durai and produced by S. S. Chakravarthy. The film features Vikram, Priyanka Trivedi, Prakash Raj, and Vivek in the leading roles. The music was composed by Deva with editing by Suresh Urs. The film released on 11 April 2003 to mixed reviews and became a box office flop. 

The film starts off by showing Chithambaram (Prakash Raj) and how he is an important man in the village. He is an adamant and always sticks on to his decisions. When the temple festival starts, Chithambaram's daughter Kausalya (Priyanka Trivedi) goes to her grandfather's (M. N. Nambiar) house to celebrate. There, she meets Suresh (Vikram), and they fall in love. Chithambaram gets into many conflicts with Suresh, not even knowing who he is. All the things that Suresh does were unintentional, but Chithambaram does not realize this. Therefore, Chithambaram ends up with a very negative opinion of Suresh. One day, everyone in Kausalya's grandfather's home finds out that Suresh and Kausalya are in love, unbeknownst to Chithambaram. On seeing this, they try to get Chithambaram to agree to the wedding. Chithambaram, however, stubbornly sticks to his decision that the marriage should not take place.

Suresh asks Chithambaram what would make him happy, and Chithambaram says that he would be happy if Suresh dies. Realizing that arguing further would be futile, Suresh decides to go back to Madras. Meanwhile, Ilavarasu gets attracted towards Kausalya's physique and begins molesting her. She somehow manages to escape and reports it to her father, but she feels that she is insecure and needs a companion. Kausalya tries to join Suresh at the railway station to go with him, but Suresh refuses, saying that if he marries her, it will be with her father's permission. At that time, Chithambaram arrived at the station to prevent his daughter from eloping with Suresh. He hears this conversation and finally decides to accept Suresh as his daughter's love, and Suresh agrees.

The film was developed under the title of "Adhisayam", with director V. Z. Durai revealing he insisted on Vikram being cast in the lead role. The project was also meant to mark the Tamil film debut of actress Priyanka Trivedi, but delays meant that two other films released beforehand. The film began schedules in early 2001 and Vikram put on weight for the role, after going on a diet for his portrayal of a police officer in "Dhill" (2001).

The film opened to mixed reviews, with Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu noting that the film is neither "action packed nor a haunting family drama", adding that time you wish it "were a little more brisk and dynamic". A further reviewer with BizHat.com wrote that the film was a "disappointment" and left "no impact" on viewers. Post-release, the film's comedy track by actor Vivek has garnered appreciation from film critics.

The film performed poorly at the box office, coming after several successful films for Vikram during the period. Vikram later claimed that he was taken for a "royal ride" and that the story went through several changes after the initial narration. He also alleged that the producer S. S. Chakravarthy was increasingly loyal to another actor, Ajith Kumar, and was not interested in portraying Vikram in good light. The film was later dubbed into Hindi and released in 2014 under the title "Aparichit 2", though it had no connection with the first part of "Aparichit" (2005).

Music for the soundtrack was scored by Deva. Lyrics written by Vairamuthu.

King (2002 film)

King is a 2002 Indian Tamil-language drama film directed by Prabhu Solomon and produced by Krishnakanth. The film featured Vikram and Sneha in the lead roles, while Vadivelu, Nassar, Janagaraj, and Santhana Bharathi play supporting roles. Dhina scored the film's music, and G. Ramesh handled the cinematography. It released in September 2002. The film was later dubbed and released in Telugu as "Remo".

Raja Krishnamoorthy (Vikram) is the only son of Shanmugam (Nassar). One day while travelling, their car meets with an accident, and both get admitted to the hospital. Dr. Cheenu (Santhana Bharathi) is their family doctor who diagnoses their blood and finds Shanmugam is infected with multiple sclerosis. Cheenu, being a close friend of Shanmugam, tells Raja that Shanmugam’s life is expected to last for 60 days and requests Raja to keep his father happy, to which Raja agrees.

Raja insists his father get back to India to meet his family. A small flashback is shown where Shanmugam married a girl by his choice, which made him leave home with his wife. Shanmugam relocated to Hong Kong and set up a business there. Shanmugam’s wife died when Raja was born, and Shanmugam took care of Raja. Raja knows that his father longs to meet his family again, so he decides to get the family united. Raja and Shanmugam leave to India to meet their family members. Everyone in the family is surprised upon seeing Shanmugam. They share some memories with him, except his father (Janagaraj), who is still angry at him. Raja is skilled in magic tricks and mimicry and impresses everyone in the family with his skills.

Tamil (Sneha) is Shanmugam's niece. She is responsible, loved by everyone in the family, and also takes care of everyone with love and affection. Raja decides to love Tamil after knowing that his father likes her. Raja proposes his love to Tamil, but she declines and says she will marry only the man as per their family’s wish. Raja creates a scene that Shanmugam's father should talk with Shanmugam, and if not, Raja will commit suicide. Shanmugam also gets united with his father. 

Raja keeps on frequent touch with Cheenu to keep him updated with Shanmugam’s condition. One day, Raja gets a headache and becomes colorblind. Shanmugam’s mobile gets a call from Cheenu. Raja modulates as Shanmugam on the call. Raja actually understands that the disease is actually for him and not his father. Raja continues speaking like his father to confirm the symptoms related to the disease but tries to behave normally. Raja feels sad knowing that he has only a few more days to live but does not disclose this to his father and Cheenu. Cheenu calls Raja and informs about a research going on for multiple sclerosis in Europe and insists him to take Shanmugam there to get treated, which might provide a chance for revival. Raja understands that the therapy is intended for him. 

Raja convinces his father to get back to Hong Kong, for which he agrees. Everyone in the family does not want Shanmugam and Raja to leave and insist them to stay with them. Raja says that there are some pending works and that they need to get back immediately. On the day of leaving, Tamil proposes her love to Raja, for which he does not reply. The movie ends with both Raja and Shanmugam leaving for treatment.


"King" was the first production venture of S. K. Krishnakant, who had earlier worked as the production executive for Lakshmi Movie Makers. The film was written and directed by A. X. Solomon who had directed the Arjun-Sonali Bendre starrer "Kannodu Kanbathellam" in 1999, under the name Prabhu. However, as that film did not perform to expectations at the box office, the director wanted to be credited as A. X. Solomon for his second Tamil film. He has since gone on to make a career under the name of Prabhu Solomon.

The film was initially titled as "Vikadan" with Suvaluxmi being the first choice of lead actress. 

During the same period Vikram had accepted another film titled "King" where he was set to play dual roles, but the film eventually was shelved, hence the title "King" was chosen to replace "Vikadan" in this project. 

Vikram took up magic lessons and learned how to roller-blade for his role in the film.
The soundtrack was composed by Dhina. All lyrics written by Vairamuthu.

The film did not fare well commercially. Post-release, Solomon revealed that he was unconvinced about Vikram portraying the lead role, feeling that he was too old to play Nassar's son, but the actor insisted that the project go ahead. Delays in the production in the film meant that Vikram's star image had risen and reviewers labelled the film as a disappointment upon release. The director noted that the story was written with the expectation of a small-time actor in the lead role, and hence Vikram's sudden popularity worked against the film. He revealed that his early career in film involved making significant compromises and was strictly against the type of cinema he had actually ventured to make.

Kasi (film)

Kasi is a 2001 Indian Tamil-language drama film written and directed by Vinayan. The film has Vikram playing the eponymous character of a blind village singer. A Tamil remake of the director's own 1999 Malayalam film "Vasanthiyum Lakshmiyum Pinne Njaanum", the film has Kaveri, reprising her role from the original and Kavya Madhavan making her Tamil debut in supporting roles. The film was produced by Aroma Mani for Sunitha Productions. The film score and soundtrack was composed by maestro Ilaiyaraaja.

The film was released on 14 November 2001 and won positive reviews from critics upon release. Vikram won the Filmfare Best Actor Award and Cinema Express Award for Best Actor – Tamil.

Kasi is a tale about the deception of appearances. Kasi (Vikram) is a blind poet and singer who supports his family by his songs. He has an older brother Sevalai (Thalaivasal Vijay), who is a drunkard; an abusive, crippled father; and a younger sister Lakshmi (Kavya Madhavan). When the local landlord Raghupathi (Rajeev) returns to the district, he brings along with him Dinesh, the CM's son and his wife Radhika (Aishwarya). Raghupathi has a reputation as a God in the area because of his charitable works, and when a specialist eye doctor arrives, he promises to pay the fees for an operation to give back Kasi's vision. Elated by this news, Kasi learns that he has to find an eye donor. His sister Kaveri (Kaveri), who cannot speak, offers one of her eyes. Unfortunately, something happens that shows that the 'God-like' Raghupathi and Dinesh are not what they seem. Blissfully unaware of the sadness of those around him, Kasi looks forward to his operation.

Simran was offered the role of Lakshmi, Vikram's sister but she refused the offer because she didn't want to act in a supporting role. Then Malayalam actress Kavya Madhavan accepted the character after being impressed by its original Malayalam version. The shooting was completed in just 45 days. Vikram had rolled up his eyes to look convincingly blind in the film for this role of an innocent, rural, struggling blind lead character. Because of this, his vision was affected and he needed glasses in order to correct it. For the movie, he sunbathed on the terrace of his beachside home in Chennai for a sunburnt look and got dizzying headaches while practising to look blind.

The soundtrack album was composed by Ilaiyaraaja. All the songs have been sung by Hariharan.

The audience saying "The magic touch, in the music of the maestro (Ilaiyaraja) is brilliant in "Kasi"".

The film received mostly positive reviews from critics. "The Hindu" applauded the off-beat attempt stating, "A film without predictable ingredients is a rarity. The "Kasi" team has to be appreciated for its boldness, in telling a story, in a simple, straight forward manner without the evitable distractions". While Vikram's portrayal was appreciated, "As a blind man, with his eyeballs completely in and with facial twitches so typical of the visually impaired, his portrait is realistic", the two lead actress too received acclaim, "Kavya Madhavan and Kaveri, have excellently expressive eyes, which have been put to good use". S. R. Ashok Kumar said, "As the blind Kasi, he touched a chord". "Sify" noted, "Vikram, it goes without saying that he is the life and soul of Kasi. As the blind singer, he brings laughter, tears and a lump in one’s throat. Vikram has given an extraordinarily detailed performance, which only a Kamalhassan can do!" and summed up saying it's an emotionally powerful movie. Balaji Balasubramaniam wrote, "The movie is populated with characters that have a big effect, both positive and negative, on us".

"Kasi" was commercially successful as well.

A shooting schedule took place at the AVM Studios in Chennai, where Vikram celebrated his birthday on the sets, with the unit members and Sharat Kumar. In an interview to Hindu in 2008, Vikram has mentioned his displeasure at being a part of the film, claiming that he had arguments with the director for every single shot and that "everything in that film, right from the first shot was wrong. From the beginning, the film was considered a certain Deepavali release. But the director Rajakumaran failed to utilize the call sheets of Sarathkumar to optimum use. Sarath got wild because of this. He too caused some delay in finishing off the shootings. Rajakumaran dragged and finished the film in two years causing delay.

The film created a hype and sensation in media due to the marriage of Devayani and the film's director Rajakumaran.

The music composed by Sirpy.

The film was finally released on March 2001 and got hit in the box office. RB Choudhary incurred huge loss through this film and dubbed film "Paapa" later he gained profits through films like "Aanandham" and "Samudhiram", both films starring actor Murali.

The film received positive reviews. Hindu wrote:"Director Rajakumaran has taken special care in the choice of songs and locations to make the film entertaining. He should have paid more attention to the first half and more important, must have extracted more work from Vikram, who has the potential, and Devayani, for whom it is a cakewalk".

Chinna (2005 film)

Chinna () is a 2005 Indian Tamil romantic action thriller film directed by Sundar C. It stars Arjun and Sneha in the lead roles. It did reasonable business at the box-office. The second half is partially inspired by the Hindi film "Darr" (1993) which has Sunny Deol, Shahrukh Khan, and Juhi Chawla in lead roles. It was dubbed in Telugu as "Koti".

The film begins with Gaythri (Sneha) marrying an irrigation engineer (Vikramaditya) against her wishes. As she conducts her marriage with mechanical unconsciousness, her sunken heart reflects her past. Gayathri, a marine student, goes to Rameswaram to study coral reefs and marine ecosystems while staying with her uncle (Vinu Chakravarthy) and her cousin in a fisherman hamlet. There she witnesses Chinna (Arjun) and his assistants (Mansoor Ali Khan and Ponnambalam) - local mobsters working for a gang - committing pitiless and violent crimes. Though she wanted to report these crimes to the local SP (Vijayakumar), her uncle and cousin dissuades her. Meanwhile, she asks her uncle for a guide to take her to locations rich in marine life. Her uncle asks Chinna to help Gayathri in her pursuit. After a couple of close encounters with Chinna, Gayathri understands his soft, childlike nature and vows to reform him as a socially acceptable man. Later, love blossoms between them. Even as Chinna tries to make his life straight, a violent feud ensues between him and the local gang. Trying to save Gayathri, Chinna kills the gang leader and is sentenced to life imprisonment. Taking advantage of Chinna's absence, Gayathri's parents marry her to the irrigation engineer. As the story ploughs through in the second half, Chinna, characterized by the obsession with "Gayathri", kills people working against his goal to attain his ladylove. At the end, after much drama, when Chinna almost killed Gayathri's husband, she shot him in order to save her husband. Chinna asked her if she had feelings for him before this, at least for a second. Just after she shook her head saying yes, he jumped off the building. The movie ends there indicating his death.

The soundtrack was composed by D. Imman.

Balaji B of "Thiraipadam" wrote "Chinnaa takes over the crown from Anbe Sivam for being the most un-Sundar.C-like Sundar.C film ever! Confusion, chaos and comedy, atleast [sic] one of which is always a trademark of his films, are nowhere to be seen here." "Indiaglitz" wrote "Sundar C has a penchant for comedy capers that are low on logic but high on entertainment. Chinna is unlike Sundar C's film, which is not just very serious but also lacks his trademark humour. However thanks to a fast narration and good performance by Sneha, Chinna manages to leave an impression with the audience."

Aayudham (2005 film)

Aayudham ("Weapon") is a 2005 Indian Tamil action film directed by Murugesh. It features Prashanth and Sneha in the lead roles, while Vadivelu, Subbaraju, Rajesh, and Janagaraj play supporting roles. Featuring music composed by Dhina, the film released in 14 January 2005 to average reviews from film critics.

Siva (Prashanth) is admitted to a medical college in Chennai. His father (Rajesh), a police constable, gets a transfer to Chennai, as well, so that he can keep an eye on his son. Siva soon develops a liking towards Mahalakshmi (Sneha), his collegemate. However, Naga (Subbaraju), Maha’s servant-maid’s son, is obsessed with making Maha his own.

The film was directed by Murugesh, who had previously directed the film, "Indru Mudhal" (2003). Sneha was selected to play the lead female role and began work on the film in May 2004. A major portion of the film was shot at Chennai Trade Center at Nandambakkam near Chennai, while few songs were filmed in London. The first schedule of the film commenced in Chennai, where a dance number was shot at a lavish set costing Rs 40 lakh at the AVM Studios, where Prashanth and fifty dancers took part. The second schedule of forty days was held at locations in Madurai, Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli, Kanyakumari and Nagercoil. Dance choreographer Dinesh choreographed two dance numbers - one in which Prashanth and Mumbai's Minal took part, the other where he danced with Rasna, a Mumbai model. Fifty girls from the musical, Bombay Dreams, were selected to feature in Sungadi saris during a song shoot at Trafalgar Square.

The film opened to mixed reviews in January 2005 alongside three other Tamil films. Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu noted that "it's all very fine if you are not looking for anything innovative in the entertainment offered", adding that "Prashanth is too experienced an actor to goof up the role. He plays Siva with ease. And as always he is more at home in action" and that "Sneha makes proper use of the couple of scenes that offer her a little scope to perform."

The film performed poorly at the box office. The film's release was hampered by the Boxing Day Tsunami which also hit Chennai.

The film score and the soundtrack were composed by film composer Dhina. The soundtrack was released in 17 December 2004 and received a positive response, with a critic labelling the album as "enjoyable".

Bose (film)

Bose is a 2004 Indian Tamil action thriller film written and directed by Senthil Kumar. It stars Srikanth and Sneha in the lead roles and Kalabhavan Mani, Nagesh, Thalaivasal Vijay, Manikka Vinayagam, and Kalairani in supporting roles. It did reasonable business at the box office. Upon release, the film was dubbed into Telugu as "Rakshana" and released in 2005, the film was also dubbed in Hindi as "Commando - The Force". The film was also remade in Kannada as "Yodha" and released in 2009. Bose follows the path of a soldier after he is fired after an incident where he injures a politician attempting to rape a girl. The politician hires thugs to take him down while the soldier attempts to take down the greedy politician.

Bose (Srikanth), the eponymous hero, is an Army commando. When Union Minister Kottaiperumal (Kalabhavan Mani) is kidnapped by terrorists, Bose goes on a daring rescue operation and manages to pull it off. Because of this, Kottaiperumal makes Bose his personal security guard. Up close with Kottaiperumal, Bose gets to know his other real side. When Kottaiperumal tries to misbehave with a college girl named Charulatha (Sneha), Bose rises up in anger. In trying to save Charulatha, he ends up shooting Kottaiperumal. Though Kottaiperumal escapes with some injuries, he gets Bose sacked from the Army. Distraught and disconsolate, Bose lands in Chennai and meets Charulatha, who is a student in Kalashektra. Upon meeting her, the duo falls in love. However, Kottaiperumal is waiting for revenge and has his goons on Bose and Charulatha's track. After some fights, Kottaiperumal's men bump off Bose's father (Manikka Vinayagam) and kidnap his family members and Charulatha. By then, Bose also stumbles upon the links of Kottaiperumal with terrorist outfits (the first kidnapping itself was a stage-managed one to win voters' sympathy), so he goes on a fight to finish. All ends well, and Bose is also reinstated in the Army.

This was the third and last time that Srikanth and Sneha were teamed up - after the successes of "April Maadhathil" (2002) and "Parthiban Kanavu" (2003).

Some action scenes were picturised on Srikanth, Jasper, and some stuntmen at a factory in Ennore. It took eight days to shoot the scene involving 23 stunt artistes. It was choreographed by stunt master Peter Hein. Srikanth, for the role of a commando, had trained under Major Ravi, who supervised the army scenes. Some of the locations for the film are Chennai, Thalakulam, Bangalore, Delhi, and Kerala. Two of the songs have been picturised in Russia.

The soundtrack was composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja and released on 9 August 2004. It features 5 songs with lyrics written by Pa. Vijay, Na. Muthukumar, Thamarai and Snehan.

"Bose" did not make it to the screens as scheduled on October 9 (Saturday) due to a last minute financial dispute. The prints left the lab on Sunday morning and made it to the screens in southern districts of Madurai and beyond only for matinee show. In Chennai and surrounding areas, the film opened with noon shows on Sunday. Nearly 5 lakh worth of advertisement was spent for the opening weekend. Trade lost almost 40 lakh due to missed opening.

Indiaglitz wrote:"Director Senthilkumar manages to hold your interest for most part. But lets slip his guard towards the end and the climax peters on predictability". Bizhat wrote:"The film is an action entertainer without any sluggishness". Sify wrote:"story is pure balderdash. Perhaps to compensate for the lack of a coherent script, the director tries to pack in as much commercial elements like songs, crass comedy and lots of action into the storyline. The first half is crisp while the latter half drags a bit. Still the high-octane action drama is watchable". Behindwoods wrote:"The first half of the movie is good, and takes phase with decent action, but the story line sags in the second half of the movie, as unnecessary violence is let loose on the goon squad". Hindu wrote:"The first half just whizzes past. It is the second half that stretches a little and also has scenes ending rather abruptly".

He also scolds Ganesh for spending all the hard earned money for the sake of his friends. But Ganesh remains positive about his friends’ talent and believes that they will succeed one day in life.

Nandhini (Preetha Vijayakumar) and Priya (Sneha) are Selvam's classmates. Nandhini loves Selvam but he does not reciprocate. Meanwhile, Priya is the daughter of Raja Shekar and she is none other than Bomma who is Ganesh's would be.

One day while watching a film called "Seeta Aur Geeta", he realises that two people can be at different places at the same time if they are twins.

However, Tony escapes and hides out at the house of Shekhar and Seema. When Shekhar realises that Tony and Jojo are wanted criminals, he tries to contact Vijay. But Tony and Jojo find out and kill Shekhar and Seema. Vijay is devastated by the loss of his two best friends and is comforted by nightclub dancer Sapna (Amrita Singh), whom he falls in love with.

Sandhya makes up her mind that she would never fall in love, and her ambition is to get a gold medal in her college degree. One day, Ganesh spots Sandhya and falls in love with her at first sight. Even though Sandhya catches a good glimpse of him, she tells her friend Fathima that she likes no one. Ganesh goes to the bus stop everyday to see Sandhya. He tries to get advice from his friends Ravi (Sriman) and Peter (Karan) to convince Sandhya to marry him. Their advice goes in vain as she does not care about him. She confronts Ganesh one day and tells him not to waste his time on her.

Ganesh gets hold of Sandhya's friend Preethi (Manthra), and she tries to talk to Sandhya, but she is unmovable. Vasudevan becomes suspicious of Ganesh and Sandhya and uses physical force on Ganesh. He also verbally abuses Sandhya, though she tries to explain her innocence. Sandhya is forced to leave town because of this.

The film generally received positive reviews. Prabha and Pady Srinivasan of Indolink.com appreciated the film due to "its different ending", and said Vijay and Suvalakshmi both sparkle in their respective roles. The film became one of several successful films in the romantic genre with Vijay featured in throughout the late 1990s. The success of the film prompted the director and actor to come together again immediately for a film titled Priyamudan, however the title was later used by Vijay for a different project.

It was remade in Hindi as "Kya Yehi Pyaar Hai" with Aftab and Amisha Patel which was released in 2002. Dwarakish remade the film in Kannada as "Majnu" starring his son Giri in lead role.

"Shakalaka Boom Boom" is based on conflicts and the power game involved in the functioning of the music industry. The film was partly shot in South Africa. Upon release the film was panned by critics and flopped at the box office, though the acting of newcomer Upen Patel was very praised, as well as Bobby Deol's role as a first-time villain.

"Shakalaka Boom Boom" follows the tale of a jealous, selfish and greedy music artist, AJ (Bobby Deol). AJ is one of the finest music artists in the industry and is currently under a stop since he can't think of a new project. AJ is in love with the hot and sexy Ruhi (Kangana Ranaut) and hopes to tell her how he feels. However, a wannabe singer, Reggie (Upen Patel) appears who falls in love with Ruhi and woos her before AJ can. 
Therefore, AJ swears to destroy Reggie's career and hence comes into Reggie's life as his friend. Getting him drunk, getting him smoking, is all that AJ has been doing to Reggie, and Reggie even loses control and passes out. One day, AJ finds out all Reggie's secrets and gets him so drunk that he has liver-fail. While Reggie was in the state of dying, AJ takes all his music-notes and beats and flees from the place. Then Ruhi shows up and takes him to the hospital. He is placed into the operation section due to liver failure, and then Ruhi plans to destroy AJ's career just like he did to Reggie.

Though Ruhi does not know that AJ isn't alone, he also has his hidden agenda with Reggie's ex-girlfriend Sheena (Celina Jaitly) who is now a bigshot due to AJ. AJ and Sheena together publish Reggie's music as their own, and it goes onto becoming a big hit. At the music-signing, Ruhi gets her gun out, though it doesn't seem to work. She seems that's it, though Karma has a different plan in mind. Due to her gun not working, she leaves and as she leaves, a disco ball randomly falls on top of AJ's head. He is placed into the hospital, and the doctors declare him 'deaf'. The ending shows him going to hell, and Reggie waking up to a better life, as he and Ruhi have now proved that the music is really his.


All songs are composed by Himesh Reshammiya and lyrics are penned by Sameer.

Because it had a controlled budget the film didn't do too badly but only grossed about 4.5 crores in the first week and its total net gross was 6 crores altogether. "Boxoffice-india" declared the film a flop.

"Shakalaka Boom Boom" attracted negative reviews from top critics of India. Mayank Shekhar of "Hindustan Times" rated the film with 1 out of 5 stars. Shakti Salgaokar of DNA gave movie a one and half stars and wrote in his review, "It's simple — sexual innuendo, potshots at popular films, bad mimicry, foreign locations, a generous dose of overacting, an item song and a gora villain. And as he magnificently presents the climax of the film. Spare us the comedy, please?" Nikhat Kazmi of "Times of India" said, "This one's definitely not for the fastidious, choosy viewer but for those who don't mind losing it for a bit, "Shakalaka Boom Boom" works like an average Bollywood musical. Performance-wise, it's one big circus with the guys hogging most of the limelight. The girls — Kangana and Celina — are mere confetti" and gave it 3 out of 5 stars. Taran Adarsh also gave it 3 out of 5 stars, saying "It's a well-crafted entertainer and lives up to the expectations of its target audience — the youth. At the box-office, its business at the multiplexes will help it generate good revenue, making it a profitable proposition for its investors."

Maanbumigu Maanavan

Maanbumigu Maanavan (English: "Respectable student") is a 1996 Indian Tamil-language action drama film and was directed by S. A. Chandrasekhar. The film has Vijay and Swapna Bedi in the lead roles, while Chinni Jayanth, Manivannan, Vijayakumar, Mansoor Ali Khan and Shrinath play other supporting roles. Music was composed by Deva. Vijay had a completely different hair and beard style, and an image makeover in this movie. This was the debut movie for Swapna Bedi. The songs were a big hit but the film ran for more than 50 days in theaters in Tamil Nadu. It was a moderate success at the box office.

The film is dealing with student strength. Shivaraj (Vijay), a college student, is leading a happy-go-lucky life, having a nice time with his friends, until two of his friends fall in love with each other. Facing stiff opposition from the girl's father, all the friends get together and get the couple married. Unfortunately, the married girl is gang-raped in the college campus by Madhan (Kalyan), the son of a ruthless politician Desingan (Mansoor Ali Khan). Unable to get justice in court, Shiva, along with his friends, now takes it upon himself to avenge his friend's death but pays a very heavy price. His mother is killed by Desingan, and they lose at court. Shiva is determined to get justice in his own way. He kills Madhan and Desingan and is sentenced to a normal jail punishment for six months for killing a corrupt advocate Mani Iyengar (Manivannan) and refusing Judge Ganapathi's (Jai Ganesh) words. After his release, he reunites with his ladylove Sneha (Swapna Pedi) by the help of her father Aavudaiyappan (Vijayakumar), who is the new police officer of Chennai.

Chandrasekhar initially wanted Devayani to pair with Vijay but she was replaced by newcomer Swapna Bedi.

Initially, "Maanbumigu Maanavan" was awarded with an 'A' certificate by the Indian Censor Board due to its violent action scenes. However, the committee later revised it to a 'U'certificate. The satellite rights of the film were purchased by Sun TV.

Naalaiya Theerpu

Naalaiya Theerpu () is an 1992 Indian Tamil-language action drama film directed by S. A. Chandrasekhar and produced and written by his wife Shoba Chandrasekhar which marked the debut of their son Vijay in the lead role alongside Keerthana and Easwari Rao. The film which also featured Srividya, Radharavi and Sarath Babu, had music composed by newcomer Manimekalai, cinematography by R. P. and editing by Gautham Raju. The film released was subjected to mixed reviews on 4 December 1992 and had poor box office return. The film was dubbed in Hindi as "Faisla Uparwale Ka" in the same year.

Mahalakshmi (Srividya) is molested by her husband Arun Mehta (Radha Ravi). Arun Mehta has affairs with many other women. Mahalakshmi has a son Vijay (Vijay), whom she raises on her own. However, things change when her son grows up.

Vijay made his debut as a leading actor with the film, aged eighteen.

Vijay being a fan of Rajinikanth told Chandrasekhar that he wanted to headline a movie. Vijay enacted a scene from "Annamalai" (1992), the one in which " Rajinikanth" challenges Sarath Babu. “He did it exactly the way it was in the film, especially the line mark this date in your calendar,” Chandrasekhar recalled. “That’s when I realised that he had talent, a fierce passion.”

Despite Chandrasekhar's confidence, "Naalaiya Theerpu" underperformed at the box office. “To be honest, I shouldn’t have made that film for him especially when he was just 18,” Chandrasekhar said. “I thought now that my son is also becoming an actor, I could continue to practise my style of filmmaking and pass on socially relevant messages to the audience through him. Maybe the timing wasn’t right.”

The music was composed by M. M. Srilekha, under the name of Manimegalai at the age of 12. The film featured lyrics written by Pulamaipithan, P. R. C. Balu and music director Bharani. The latter went on to become a popular music composer.

"The Indian Express" wrote "Many tongue-in-cheek remarks on the prevailing political and economic climate makes the film worth watching".

After the Release of "Naalaiya Theerpu", a famous Tamil Weekly quoted "Intha Moonjiya ellam Kaasu Kuduthu Paakanuma".

<doc id="9683846" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9683846" title="Roadside Romeo">
Roadside Romeo

Roadside Romeo is a 2008 3D Indian-American computer animated romantic comedy film written and directed by Jugal Hansraj in his directorial debut., produced by Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra of Yash Raj Films and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures in United States, United Kingdom and India. The film follows a dog living in Mumbai, as voiced by Saif Ali Khan, and his girlfriend, Laila, voiced by Kareena Kapoor. This was the first voice-over in an animated production for both actors.

It was released on 24 October 2008 in the United States and India. An Arabic dub was released in Kuwait on a day earlier. This was the second Bollywood film to receive a North American release by a Hollywood studio, following Sony Pictures' "Saawariya" (2007). The film received generally negative reviews from critics, with most of the criticism focused on the film's script, predictable plot, Hansraj's direction and overuse of cliches.

Romeo is a dog who once lived in luxurious surroundings. One day his owners decide to migrate to London and he is left at the mercy of the servant of the house, who dumps him on the streets of Mumbai. Left to fend for himself, he is soon cornered by the local gang – Guru, Interval, Hero English and a dog-wannabe-cat, Mini, who tell him that this is their domain. Romeo does not know the street lingo and is at a loss for words at first, but he manages to win the gang over with giving them haircuts. They love their new looks and accept Romeo as part of their gang. Together, they set up a successful dog-grooming business until Chhainu, the right-hand of gangster-dog Charlie Anna, arrives to collect "weeklies" (weekly protection money) in the form of bones. Romeo throws Chhainu out, and the others, terrified, go to Charlie to plead their case. Charlie threatens them with his trio of female ninja dogs, whom he calls his Angels, but Romeo tricks Charlie into allowing his friends to leave unhurt.

Romeo then meets Laila, who is singing from a rooftop, they dance and he falls in love. To win her over, Laila tells Romeo he must dance with her in front of everyone at the "Moonlight Club" where she performs. Romeo says yes, unaware that Charlie has long wanted her, and anyone who dares go near her is punished. However, Romeo braves the odds and dances with Laila to win her heart. As Laila starts falling in love with him, Charlie, in a fit of rage, captures and terrorizes Romeo. Romeo then promises that he would make Laila fall in love with Charlie. Romeo does not intend to lose Laila but plans to deflate Charlie's ego by having a disguised Mini pretend to be Laila and make it clear she's not interested. This only ends up exacerbating Charlie's ire, and Romeo promises him a second meeting with Leila.

The night of the appointment, however, Chhainu catches Romeo kissing Laila, who then shouts at Romeo telling Laila of Romeo's deal with Charlie and she angrily slaps him and says she never wants to see him again despite Romeo's pleas and forgiveness. In a pursuit, Charlie's Angels are wooed by Guru, Interval and Hero English, Chhainu is cornered by a mouse (and smashed with a "jumbo jet") and Charlie is chased and caught by the city dogcatchers. But just before Charlie is caught with a net, Romeo pushes him under the dog-catchers van to escape while Romeo goes, Charlie then convinces Guru, Hero English, Interval and Mini to create a distraction to get the guard away from the van, they all succeed and Charlie jumps on the van and says he will free Romeo using a pin in his chain to pick the lock, but the van begins to drive and he falls off, after which Charlie races after the van, losing the pin in the progress, but thankfully one of Charlie's ear hairs suffice.

They escape but Romeo feels there is no point staying as Laila said she never wanted to see him again, and Charlie badly wants her. The next morning, Romeo throws his sack onto an open train boxcar about to leave the station but Charlie arrives with Laila and the others. Charlie tells Romeo that he is a fool for leaving Laila when she still loves him, that he explained everything to her and says she is Romeo's and no one else's. He lets go of her hand and Laila begins to run after the train, while Romeo holds his hand out for her. Resembling a famous scene from "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge", Charlie remarks "where have I seen this before?". She reaches for his hand and grabs it but the handle Romeo was holding had lost its top screws, making him fall off with Laila, after which they raise their heads to each other and say "I love you" in sync. It then goes to the "Moonlight Club" where everyone is back singing a reprise of "Main Hoon Romeo" in party-remix.


As a fan of animation, Jugal Hansraj teamed up with Aditya Chopra to write their first cartoon. Nothing came of the collaboration, the writer/director recalls, "till this one day, I was waiting at the traffic signal and saw these dogs playing in the dirt... un-cared for, scruffy looking gang, totally "mast" in a garbage pile, and I instantly knew the characters of my story." The alliance by producer Yash Chopra and Disney chairman Dick Cook is a first in the field of animation. This also is the first mainstream CGI feature film to come out of India. Visual Computing Labs (VCL), a division of Tata Elxsi Ltd., another computer animation studio, similar to Walt Disney Animation Studios, was involved with everything from visual conceptualisation, character design to animation and final output. Production commenced in January 2007, continuing for two and a half years and involved 150 crew members; twenty-one months were spent on the animation. It also benefited from the use of Tata Elxsi's EKA, one of the world's fastest supercomputers. Though the company did not publicly release the film's budget, Britain's "Guardian" reported it to be about US$7 million. The first trailer, shown on 12 October 2007 with the release of the film "Laaga Chunari Mein Daag", shows the film's crew holding an audition for Romeo; another trailer was later shown with Laila's audition
. Though the release was originally scheduled for the summer of 2008, the release was put off to Diwali. The costumes for the lead characters were made at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida for the film's Indian promotion. Yash Raj Films worked with "Hot Muggs" for producing licensed merchandise for the film. Hot Muggs integrated an inaugural concept of incorporating one-liners from the movie like "Tension Not," "Stay Cool" and "I'm Good Na" on coffee mugs. Though many Bollywood actors promoted the film, the two main stars of "Romeo", Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan did not do much promotion. Kapoor told the producers she would be busy promoting her other Diwali release, "Golmaal Returns". Khan simply made himself inaccessible.

Yash Raj Films, for the first time ever, held a pre-release screening for film exhibitors on 18 October 2008. It was then released exclusively across local multiplexes on 24 October 2008. During the weekend of its release, the film faced competition from "Heroes", hence it opened to a poor response of 40- 45%, which improved two days later to 60–70%. Its first-week gross of Rs. 45 million (US$912,316) made it an Indian record for a Disney production. The film was declared disaster at the Indian box office. In the United States and Canada, the film debuted in as many as 40 theatres on the same day. On the first weekend, it made US$41,770 (Rs. 2,080,000) and placed 49th. The following week, its gross income came to US$55,202. The film opened with similar results in 23 British theatres, grossing £31,576 (Rs. 2,470,000). The movie fared poorly in Australia with an income of only US$13,233 (Rs. 652,000) from 9 venues; and in New Zealand it brought in US$604 (Rs. 29,792) from 2 venues. In Kuwait, the film opened on 23 October 2008 and grossed US$14,549 in the first week.

Upon its theatrical release, "Roadside Romeo" received negative reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh gave the film three stars out of five, citing its borrowing from the masala films of 1980s and a predictable story. Another factor he said went against the film was its lack of good music. Though the title track and ""Chhoo Le Na"" were publicised, they lacked impact. Though the film was targeted at children, he said Charlie Anna's south Indian accent was hard to decipher and comprehend even for adults. Despite the drawbacks, he cited the animation's good quality which could even be compared to international standards. "The New York Times" criticised the movie saying, "The animated dogs in "Romeo" aren’t particularly appealing. They mostly walk on two legs and, unlike Disney characters, don’t wear anything beyond neck gear. They look oddly naked and move awkwardly, which flattens the dance sequences and keeps the film earthbound."

The film's soundtrack was released on 1 October 2008 by director Jugal Hansraj and actor Jaaved Jaffrey at "The Club" in Andheri, Mumbai. The music was composed by Salim-Sulaiman, and lyrics have been penned by Jaideep Sahni. Joginder Tuteja from "indiaFM" gave the film's soundtrack 2 out of 5 stars and noted, "The songs in themselves are no great shakes and, except for a track or two, the remaining just passes muster. [The] Delayed release of the album would take a further toll on the sales of "Roadside Romeo". Overall, "Roadside Romeo" is a barely an okay album where one's hope only rests on the state of art animation (as promised by the makers)."

The film starts with a voice (Kader Khan) narrating a small town of Mumbai. A gangster named Kanta (Sadashiv Amrapurkar) wants to destroy the town and is in a battle with Karanjia (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), who wants to replace the town with a shopping mall. Ramesh "Rama" Kulkarni (Samir Soni) returns to his town after several years and is greeted by all of his friends, neighbors and youngest sister, Pinky (Mamta Mishra). It's only Rama's father, Vinayak Kulkarni (Govind Namdeo), a school teacher, who does not greet him and is angered with Rama.

A few days later, Rama's younger brother, Satish (Faisal Khan) returns after completing his studies. Rama begins guarding his town from the gangsters of the town. Karanjia hires Rama and gives him some money and weapons for his protection. Rama buys gifts for his family, but everyone refuses to take the gifts and they refuse him into his family. Rama decides to marry Madhu (Sanober Kabir), a girl who has fallen in love with Rama.

During a festival of Shi'a Muslims, Kanta and his gangsters start terrorizing it. Rama and his friends began fighting Kanta's gangsters, until Rama is killed by Kanta's gangsters. Karanjia hires Satish, who decides to take the revenge of his brother's death. Satish is in love with a girl named Priya (Shama Sikander), whom Karanjia treats like his daughter. Satish's family gets destroyed, when his sister Pinky is raped by the Minister (Pramod Moutho) and his father is heartbroken at hearing the news. Pinky commits suicide and Satish's father dies by a heart attack. Satish is outraged and kills Police Commissioner (Ranjeet), who is replaced by the new Commissioner of Maharashtra, Jabbar (Rajendra Gupta).

Karanjia has an evil plan to finish Kulkarni family and rule over the town, where his partnership with Kanta is revealed. Karanjia's goons set out to kill Satish, where Priya saves Satish and gets shot in heart by herself. It is thought that Satish is also dead. One day, Kanta and his goons start spreading terror in the town, until Satish fights with them and kills Kanta and his goons and is arrested for the murders by Commissioner Jabbar.

After that, Vijay takes it and as he looks at it he knows that those aren't love letters, they're all Anitha's new address in Chennai.

Vijay tries to find her. One day Vijay goes to a restaurant in Chennai to eat and he asks the server where the washroom is. The server tells him that there are two washrooms, one on the upstairs and another on the current ground floor. The server tells him to not go upstairs because it's dangerous. Vijay goes upstairs to the bathroom to expose himself to the Chennai people, but there, he finds an illegal sex film shoot happening.

By this, they blame Vijay for the death of the restaurant owner (who tripped) and Vijay just has to escape. This news reaches Anitha's father who is a police officer. He tries to capture Vijay. But at last, Raghavan understands Vijay's innocence and unites Anitha with him. Finally, Vijay kills the villain also, who was really responsible for the restaurant owner's death.

The film won numerous awards including National Film Award – Best Actor for Naseeruddin Shah, while Sai Paranjpye got the Best Screenplay. At the Filmfare Awards, it won the top two: that of Best Movie and Filmfare Award – Best Director, plus a Best Dialogue Award for Sai Paranjpye. Further, Shabana Azmi was nominated for Best Actress, which she eventually won for the film "Bhavna".

This film is about the blind, in particular about the lives and feelings of blind children and the principal of their school. "Sparsh" refers to the sensation and feeling of touch upon which blind people rely in the absence of sight.

The story opens with Anirudh Parmar (Naseeruddin Shah) as the principal of Navjivan Andhvidyalay, a school for the blind that educates about 200 blind children. Anirudh has a dark and lonely existence for the most part. One day, while on his way to the doctor, he hears a lovely song and ends up mesmerized at the singer's door instead of the doctor.

The voice belongs to Kavita Prasad (Shabana Azmi), a young woman recently widowed after three years of marriage. Kavita, too, prefers a secluded existence. Her childhood friend Manju (Sudha Chopra) is about the only friend she has.

Manju throws a small party where Kavita and Anirudh meet again. He recognizes her from her voice. During the conversation, he mentions that the school is looking for volunteers to read, to sing, to teach handicrafts and spend time with the children. Kavita is reluctant, but she is urged by Manju and her husband Suresh to strongly consider it. Kavita decides to volunteer.

As Kavita spends more time at the school, she begins forming a friendship with Anirudh. The friendship grows stronger over time and they become engaged. But their personalities and feelings are different. Anirudh is of strong character: He firmly believes that the blind need help but not pity or charity. (When once, in his office, Kavita attempts to assist him with coffee, he gets enraged at the thought of his guest offering to overcome his obvious difficulty with hospitality.) Kavita, recently bereaved, looks to the school (and Anirudh) as a way towards an ideal, one of sacrificial service. Anirudh gets wind of this and assumes Kavita is simply seeking to fill the void in her life with this form of service. He assumes she accepted the proposal, not out of love, but as a sacrifice towards a way out of her dark life. During this time, Anirudh's fellow blind friend Dubey (Om Puri) laments that his recently deceased wife was not happy in their marriage.

Anirudh is shaken, confused and disturbed by all this. He breaks off the engagement (but does not mention the reason to Kavita). She accepts his decision.

Kavita, now a salaried employee of the school, continues to help the children. The initial coldness between her and Anirudh gives way to friction and eventually, over a series of events at the school, brings up the feelings they were not able to discuss before. The situation spirals downward and one of them must leave the school.

The movie ends with Anirudh and Kavita being 'touched' by the depth of their feelings for one another and finally seeing a way out.


Filming

Much of the film was shot at the Blind Relief Association in New Delhi and the character of Anirudh is modelled on Mr Mittal, who was the headmaster of the Blind Relief Association.



"Sparsh"'s music is by veteran music director Kanu Roy and lyrics are by Indu Jain.

Aanch

Aanch is a 2003 Hindi movie directed by Rajesh Kumar Singh. Nana Patekar, Paresh Rawal, Suchindra and Sharbani Mukherjee played the lead roles. It's an epic love story set against the background of a crime ridden area of rural Uttar Pradesh. Sanjeev-Darshan scored the music for the movie.

Mahadev Thakur (Nana Patekar) and Jawahar Pandit (Paresh Rawal) belong to two different villages Mandaur and Amirpur respectively. They hate each other for reasons best known to them. Diwakar's (Suchindra Bali)'s father (residing in Amirpur) and Vidya's (Sharbani Mukherjee)'s brother Shiva (Deep Raj Rana) (a resident of Mandaur) decide to get Diwakar and Vidya married.
The preparations for the marriage ceremony begin and neither the boy nor the girl knowing what the other looks like. In the meanwhile, the two villages get ready to confront each other in case of a quarrel. The wedding ceremony is underway when the revelry between the two village heads starts and the guns roar. The bride and the groom come separately to the town for studies oblivious of each other. They are happy to escape the brutal world of rural India to find their own careers and future. They first bump into each other in the train while on their way to the town, then in the college, completely unaware of all facts. For Diwakar, its love at first sight, but Vidya doesn't respond to his overtures. Later she packs her bags and heads straight for her village Mandaur. In the meanwhile, Diwakar learns that Vidya is his legally wedded wife and he decides to get her back from the clutches of two warring villages. It is not easy for them to unite since both village heads Mahadev and Jawahar and their coteries object to their uniting due to bitter hatred. They do unite ultimately but after a lot of blood-bath and struggle.

Ninaithale

Ninaithale is a 2007 Tamil movie starring Suchindra and Nargis Bagheri in the lead roles. This movie is the remake of the Telugu blockbuster movie "Anand". It is Suchindra's first Tamil movie as hero. The film is directed by Viswas Sundar who is also the producer for the films "Adhu" and "Chanakya".

The story opens with a car accident in which Rupa's (Nargis Bagheri) parents are killed due to the carelessness of a drunken driver. She becomes an orphan, but friends and neighbours support her, and she gets a good job. She falls in love with Rahul, her colleague, and she accepts to marry him. On the other side, there is Anand (Suchindra), who has returned from the United States and is forced to attend a family friend’s wedding. On the wedding day, he meets the bride Rupa, and it is love at first sight for him, but soon, the wedding is called off because of some arguments between Rupa and her future mother-in-law. Anand is very happy because of the marriage getting cancelled. He talks to Rupa and admires her for her boldness. He completely falls in love with her. To win her love, he does lots of things like shifting his house nearer to hers, gradually developing friendship with her and finally entering into her heart. However, when she starts to love him, she comes to know that Anand's father was the murderer of her parents. The rest of the story is about if the lovers will be united.
This film is a remake of Sekhar Kammulas Anand (2004 film).


The movie was earlier entitled "Sweet". However, Sundar changed the title because of the announcement of the Tamil Nadu Government that Tamil films with Tamil names will be exempted from entertainment tax. The shooting of the song "Naanthaanaa Naanthaanaa" took place in Golkonda, capital and fortress city of the Qutb Shahi kingdom, near Hyderabad. Another important scene was shot in Kushaldass Garden in Chennai.

Soundtrack was composed by Vijay Antony.

The film received generally positive reviews but failed to create any impact at the box office due to non-prominent cast. Cinesouth reported the movie was 'sweet'. One India website reported that the movie was average, praising the acting of Nargis. Apun Ka Choice also gave good reviews.

Kannodu Kanbathellam

Kannodu Kanbathellam (English: "All that is seen by the eyes") is an Indian 1999 Tamil romantic thriller film written and directed by Prabhu Solomon in his directorial debut. The film has Arjun and Sonali Bendre in the lead roles, while Suchindra, Ruchita, Manivannan, Crazy Mohan, Anu Mohan, Kovai Sarala and Nizhalgal Ravi portray supporting roles. Music was composed by Deva. The film was released in August 1999 along with poor reviews and was declared flop at the box office. The film was dubbed in Telugu as "Prema Gharshana". The film's name is based off a song from "Jeans".

Seetharam (Arjun) is a well-respected businessman who lives with his PA Muthuswamy (Anu Mohan) in Chennai. Although being a short-tempered and tense person, Seetharam is good at heart and helps people in need. He soon meets and falls in love with Kalyani (Sonali Bendre). After a couple of meetings she sees his good nature and falls in love with him.

But, Seetharam faces problems in the form of another loving couple, Akash (Suchindra) and Akhila (Ruchita) due to an argument between Akhila and Akash and Akhila acts as Seetharam's fiancé so that she can get rid of Akash just before he proposes to Kalyani. Kalyani, being an innocent, believes her words and goes away from Seetharam. Hence, Seetharam becomes the main antagonist of the film to make the lives of Akash and Akhila miserable. An enraged and betrayed Seetharam therefore seeks revenge against Akash and Akhila by separating them. But, he fails in all of his attempts. He also attempts to stop the love marriage between Akash and Akhila, which is arranged by Madana Gopal (Manivannan), Akash's father.

But, when Akash and Akhila meet and ask apologies to him, but Seetharam does not forgive them and sends goons to kill them. To his horror and sad shock, Seetharam meets Kalyani with her blind husband (Nizhalgal Ravi). She tells him that Akash and Akhila met her and apologized for their behaviour, but she learnt the good heart of Seetharam after her marriage. Seetharam also informs this matter to Akash and Akhila, and saves them from the henchmen who have not seen Seetharam and don't know that he was the one who hired them to murder. Seetharam bids goodbye to both of them. Hence, the movie ends with the moral that "Too much of anything is good for nothing."

After sending goons to kill both Akash and Akhila, Seetharam had a change in mind and decides to forgive and save them from the henchmen. A fight ensures when Seetharam asked the henchmen to leave both them for which they refuse, since they didn't know that he was the one who hired them to murder Akash and Akhila. After the fight with the henchmen Seetharam forgives and bids goodbye to both of them. Unexpectedly as a sweet surprise Seetharam meets Kalyani at the airport with her blind brother (Nizhalgal Ravi). She tells him that Akash and Akhila met her and apologized for their behaviour and she learnt the good heart of Seetharam. Finally the movie ends with Seetharam and Kalyani uniting.


Anbalaya Films offered debutant Prabhu Solomon an opportunity to direct a film for their production house, after he had helped them complete the post-production works for "Murai Mappillai" (1995) when director Sundar C walked out. Prabhu Solomon chose to feature Raghuvaran and Bhanupriya in the leading roles, though the producers Anabalaya Films were reluctant to cast a character artiste in the lead role. Prabhu revealed he met Arjun in Thenkasi during the making of "Mudhalvan" (1999), at the insistence of his producer and actively tried to make a poor impression. Arjun, nonetheless, was keen and worked on the film.

Soundtrack was composed by Deva and lyrics written by Vaali, Kalaikumar and Thamarai.

"New Straits Times" felt that film would have done by "someone more experienced".

First Love Letter

First Love Letter is a 1991 Indian film directed by Shiva and starring Vivek Mushran and Manisha Koirala in the lead roles with Chunky Pandey making a special guest appearance.

"First Love Letter" is a Pahlaj Nihalani film in which Vivek Mushran and Manisha Koirala made their original debut in a romance and action scenario showing that love transcends all barriers. Since Subhash Ghai was introducing the stars in "Saudagar (1991 film)", Pahlaj Nihalani had to wait for the release of his film, which was completed before "Saudagar".

The story opens with Radha, Manisha Koirala wanting more from life than just being a rich heiress to her father Thakur Ajit Singh's, Danny Denzongpa fortunes and wants to relocate from her home to the hilly locales of Palampur, where her father has a house. This is not liked by her father, but he has to relent due to the intervention of his younger brother Thakur Shrikant Singh, played by Dalip Tahil, who is living the life of a recluse after the murder of his lady love Kasturi.

In the hilly locales, Radha is mesmerized one day to the melodies of a flute, which she follows and meets Shyam, Vivek Mushran, who also saves her life when she is about to fall in the deep gorges of the valleys. They meet again and slowly develop a bond of inseparable love, both being drawn to each other's youth and simplicity. Radha does not disclose her true identity, at first and when Shyam comes to know that she is the daughter of Thakur Ajit Singh, he feels cheated as he considers him to be a tyrant landlord. To top it, Thakur Ajit Singh also dislikes this growing intimacy between a local milk seller, which is the profession of Shyam and his only daughter. So he fixes the marriage of his daughter to Thakur Ambar Singh, Chunky Pandey.

Meanwhile, Radha is attacked by seasoned killer Bheema, Gulshan Grover, who wants to molest her, but is timely saved by Thakur Ambar Singh, who also now falls in love with her. His mother Uma Devi, Sushma Seth makes him all the more happy when she tells him that Radha was the same girl that she has fixed his marriage with. This alliance when revealed to Radha by her father and mother Beena Banerjee, is rejected by her, but she is forcibly married to Thakur Ambar Singh. Radha on her part, leaves the marriage ceremony and tells Thakur Ambar Singh that she loved Shyam and had secretly married him.

Thakur Ajit Singh now gets Shyam embroiled in a false police case and gets him imprisoned from where he jail breaks with none other than the killer Bheema. Bheema is hired as a contract killer by Thakur Ajit Singh to kill Shyam. What follows is a bloody encounter with Thakur Ambar Singh, Bheema, Radha and Shyam, where like a true Rajput, Thakur Ambar Singh wants to leave Radha for Shyam, seeing their love, and is horribly wounded in the prospect.
The end sees Thakur Ajit Singh realizing his mistake of separating the true lovers and unites them in holy matrimony. The movie is an eye opener on teenage love.

Bazaar (1982 film)

Bazaar (; ) is a 1982 Indian drama film directed by Sagar Sarhadi and starring Naseeruddin Shah, Farooq Shaikh, Smita Patil and Supriya Pathak. The film set in Hyderabad, India, highlights the issue of bride buying in India, through the tragedy of a young girl being sold by needy parents to affluent expartraite Indians in the Gulf.

The movie opens with Najma (Smita Patil) decking herself up in a flat in Mumbai. She soon entertains a guest, Akhtar Hussain, who turns out be her love interest. He talks of an argument at his house with his father who had asked him to marry the daughter of an affluent cement factory owner. Akhtar claims that he refused the offer and had told his father that he will marry the woman of his choice. At being asked when they would get married by Najma, Akhtar reveals that in order to marry against the wishes of the family it is necessary that he start earning his own living. He further assures the crestfallen Najma that one Shakir Khan,a middle-aged man working in the gulf area, who would soon be coming to their place, would help him with the money to set up some business. Najma is apprehensive of Shakir Khan's stay with her but Akhtar says that there is no other way as after all, the flat has been provided for by Shakir Khan himself. As the evening proceeds, it is revealed that Najma has received many letters from her home for the past 6 years however, she never reads them as she still hasn't forgiven her family for forcing her into selling herself in order to earn some money for the family. She had been willing to engage in some other work but her mother had insisted that the pride of the Nawaabs that they had once been would be tarnished if she becomes a working woman and so it would be better to sell the body instead as it is only about a night and can be accomplished secretly. As Akhtar spends the night at Najma's, she remembers how on one of his visits Akhtar had offered to take her with him with a hope of marrying her soon and she too had run away with him.

The next day Najma is visited by Salim, a renowned poet, who has been in love with her for the past 6 years however, she hasn't accepted his love. The two share a friendly relationship and are very comfortable with each other. Salim once again reiterates that he often thinks about her and that though he couldn't marry her 6 years ago, he is quite capable of so today. Salim tells her that she is living a life of lies as Akhtar only visits her to spend the night and has no intention of marrying her.
Najma and Akhtar receive Shakir Khan at the airport. The next morning Shakir questions Najma on the whereabouts of Akhtar, hinting at the promiscuous nature of their relationship and eyeing Najma the whole time. Najma reaffirms her love for Akhtar at which Shakir says that he always wanted to see her settled and would be happy to help Akhtar in his endeavours. He further expresses his intention to marry a woman like her which leaves her a bit taken aback.

Shakir Khan asks Najma to throw a kind of party in the evening where he separately tells Akhtar of his wish to marry a woman as he misses the comfort of home and family. A flashback shows Shakir Khan having his own wife and children however, it is apparent that he was abusive and so not welcome in his house. He wants Najma to find him a bride for him from her home city, Hyderabad. When Akhtar tells Najma of this she feels revolted however, she agrees to find a beautiful bride for Shakir at the prospect of this deed helping her and Akhtar to set up their life as a couple.

The scene changes to Hyderabad where Sarju and Shabnam fall in love with each-other. Sarju asks Nasreen, who secretly loves Sarju, to help set up a meeting with Shabnam who happens to be her friend. Nasreen is heartbroken but in the face of reality she decides to keep her feelings to herself as both Sarju and Shabnam were much in love. Meanwhile, Najma buys the jewellery and other articles that will be necessary for the wedding and the wedding party, including the common friend, Salim, departs for Hyderabad. While they travel in the train, a flashback reveals how Salim used to visit Najma at her home in Hyderabad and express his feelings but Najma refuses time and again saying that she is that golden bird for her family whose secret is unknown to him. She says that she cannot marry him and that it would be better that he forget her. She promises to acknowledge him as a friend shall their paths ever cross again.

Back in Hyderabad, Shabnam's mother has to let go of a good match for her eldest daughter as she cannot afford to fulfil the demands of the groom's side. Hajjan Bi, the middlewoman, chides Shabnam's mother as in this way they would never find a match however, she leaves promising to tell her if a good match comes her way. Meanwhile, Najma, now in Hyderabad, sets out in search for a bride. She ends up in a place where the poor are literally showcasing their daughters hoping to get their young girls, even some who have just touched puberty, married and receive some amount of money in return. Najma is horrified by this and questions her role in this whole wedding plan.
Anywhow, she decides visit her family in Hyderabad and finds her mother all sentimental to see her back. She also meets Sarju, her childhood friend whom she considers her younger brother. He tells her that he has found a girl he wishes to marry. Najma feels very happy and promises to help him get married and that too quite grandly. As she leaves, she comes across Nasreen and asks her if she has come to meet Sarju to which she replies in the affirmative. Najma ends up thinking that Nasreen is the girl Sarju was talking about.

At a small gathering, consisting of the wedding party from Mumbai, Sarju, Nasreen and Shabnam, Shabnam sings a beautiful song at which Shakir Khan seems quite impressed. He later expresses his wish to marry Shabnam which shocks Najma as Shabnam is quite young and not yet 16. However, Akhtar persuades her to set up the wedding as even if she refuses to, the poor parents will be more than happy to get one of their daughters married to such a rich man. The bride's family accepts the offer but sets up their own demands asking for 5000 rupees for the family (to be used for the elder daughter's marriage) and 101 rupees as bakshish for the middlewoman, Hajjan Bi. With the wedding being set up, Salim is horrified at the whole thing and in a drunken state expresses his anger at how the girls are being sold off to the rich because of poverty. He equates the setting up of the wedding to the system where humans are auctioned. When Sarju gets to know of the wedding, he confronts Shabnam's parents asking them that how they could do so knowing that he and Shabnam loved each other and that he was working hard to earn a living with the intention of marrying her. He points out that they have auctioned her happiness and swears that he will either not let this wedding take place or destroy himself. On the other hand, Najma is not able to deal with the whole situation and constantly questions her role in it. Salim tells her that marriage is but a socially acceptable way of selling and buying humans and that she too has been a victim of a similar market. He tells her that as long as she is dependent on a man she will only be a toy but once she stands on her own will be when she becomes her own person, with her separate identity. At that point, Sarju comes over to Najma and tells her that she had set up his love with Shakir Khan. Najma feels terrible and tries to get the wedding cancelled but to no avail. She breaks down and apologises for messing it up. Sarju takes matters into his own hands and pleads Shakir Khan to break off the wedding relating all his troubles but only gets thrashed by him in return with Akhtar and some of the others from the wedding party as mute spectators.

Shabnam is revolted by the relationship her family had set up but has no choice. She pleads not to get married but all her pleas fall on deaf ears. She goes to the mazaar and unties the thread which she had once tied with the wish to have Sarju as a husband. She points out that she had asked for life when she had tied this thread of wish at the mazaar but now only takes back the dead body of all her wishes. Sarju meets Shabnam for the last time with the help of Nasreen and the two feel sorrowful at the turn of events. Shabnam gets married to Shakir Khan. Salim decides to go back to Mumbai while Najma plans to stay put. She rejects Akhtar, who was quite elated as now it meant that Shakir Khan would surely help him set up a good life. Najma points out that if he could commit such a thing for money then he could perhaps even sell her off one day for his benefit. Akhtar breaks down and says that he will be destroyed without her to which she replies that he has already destroyed himself by being a pawn in Shakir Khan's endeavours. On the wedding night, Shakir Khan finds his new bride dead on the bridal bed. Shabnam had committed suicide by poisoning herself. Sarju is heartbroken at the news. Najma feels guilty and catches the train to Mumbai through which Salim was leaving. She faces Salim and relates the news of Shabnam's death at the end of which she owns up to being a part of this unfairness, this crime.


Nearly 10 years after the film's release, song "Karoge Yaad To Har Baat Yaad Aayegi" was used in the 1995 album Saadgi.

Prema Pusthakam

Prema Pusthakam () is a 1993 Telugu language romance film which was partly directed by Gollapudi Srinivas before his death on the set of the film; it was later finished by his father, Gollapudi Maruthi Rao. It featured newcomers Ajith Kumar and Kanchan in the lead roles, with Devendran was the music composer. This film is Ajith Kumar's only Telugu film to date as his previous Telugu film did not release after the director passed.

The film was written by Gollapudi Srinivas, son of noted director Gollapudi Maruthi Rao, in early 1992 and Ajith Kumar was signed on to feature in the lead role in August 1992. However, during the ninth day of the shoot, the debutant director died after succumbing to injuries suffered during a water accident on sets in Vizag, Andhra Pradesh. The death led to creation of the Gollapudi Srinivas Award, with the director's father Gollapudi Maruthi Rao giving the award to promising debutant directors to continue his son's legacy. The film was duly delayed and later completed by Srinivas's father and only released in 1993.

The film went on to win the Nandi Award for Best Screenplay Writer in 1994 for Gollapudi Maruthi Rao. The film has been described by commentators as an "eminently forgettable" debut for Ajith Kumar, due to the problems faced during production. It was later dubbed and released in Tamil as "Kadhal Puthagam" in 1997.

The Last Lear

The Last Lear is a 2007 Indian drama film directed by Rituparno Ghosh. The film won the National Award of India for Best Feature Film in English in 2007. The film stars Amitabh Bachchan, Preity Zinta, Arjun Rampal, Divya Dutta, Shefali Shah and Jisshu Sengupta. Shefali Shah won the Best Supporting Actress National Award for her role in the movie. It was produced by Arindam Chaudhuri of Planman Motion Pictures.

Basing the script on Utpal Dutt's semiautobiographical play "Aajker Shahjahan", Rituparno Ghosh penned it in 2006, and turned to the actors in February 2007, all of whom accepted the offer. The film began shooting from 28 February 2007 to 10 April 2007; principal shooting took place in Kolkata and some shooting took place in Mussoorie, Uttarakhand. Dubbing for the film ended on 31 August 2007.

"The Last Lear" premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival on 9 September and received a significant reception, earning many accolades after being showcased at a Gala Presentation.

The film was later showcased at the London Film Festival, and the International Film Festival of India in Goa. The film was received positively by critics with many saying that Bachchan has given a career best performance.

The story revolves around Harish Mishra (Amitabh Bachchan), a retired Shakespearean theatre actor who spent precisely thirty years and nine months on stage and then suddenly quit, and his first and last act as a cinema artist. He is immensely passionate about Shakespeare, believes that nothing even comparable can ever be written, knows all his plays by heart, lives in those stories, condemns modern cinema and considers theatre as a much higher artform for directors and actors to convey their message to an audience.

It is Diwali, a time when box offices are flooded with new releases and Shabnam (Preity Zinta) has to attend the premiere of her latest movie: "The Mask". However, she decides to visit her co-star Harish and heads to a cubbyhole of old Kolkata where Harish is bedridden in a coma. He is being taken care by Vandana (Shefali Shah) and a nurse, Ivy (Divya Dutta). Vandana treats Shabnam with spite as she blames her and the entire cast and crew for Harish's condition. But soon they are seen bonding over tea and are involved in a conversation about Harish. In flashbacks, their story and equation with Harish emerges.

The movie sees parallel narration from Goutam (Jisshu Sengupta), a journalist who recalls his encounters with the veteran actor. He had suggested Harish for the lead role to his elder brother Siddharth (Arjun Rampal) who happens to be an ambitious perfectionist director. After a casual meeting with Harish, Siddharth realizes that to convince Harish to act in his film, he has to win his trust and establish a relationship with him. And, hence, the impatient young auteur attempts to win the trust and collaboration of the aged performer, who sits raging against the modern world from the sanctuary of his study.

Harish finally agrees to act in the film. Shooting happens on the stunning Himalayan foothills of Mussoorie. On the sets he befriends Shabnam and teaches her lessons on acting, life and Shakespeare. As the story unfolds one gets to know his relationship with Vandana, the reason behind his quitting theatre and last but not the least the reason for his illness. "The Last Lear" becomes a captivating reflection on the comparative artifices of stagecraft and cinema.


Nirpal Dhaliwal of "The Guardian" called it "The most god-awful film I have ever seen", criticizing its use of rather hammy English language then Hindi and mentioning that the main actor, Amitabh Bachchan, is a combination of Steve McQueen, James Stewart and Sean Connery all rolled into one but in this film he is closer to Bruce Forsyth and Derek Jacobi.

Janet Gruttsman of Reuters mentioned that the film doesn't have no music or dance routines which is common with many Bollywood films. IndiaGlitz praised the film's cinematography and acting but criticized its screenplay, especially the ending. Sukanya Verma of "Rediff.com" gave it 3 out of 5 stars saying that "[The problem with "The Last Lear"] is that while Ghosh builds Harry's aura to perfection, everyone around him fails to reach out."

Jab We Met

Jab We Met (English: "When We Met") is a 2007 Indian romantic comedy film written and directed by Imtiaz Ali. The film, produced by Dhillin Mehta under Shree Ashtavinayak Cinevision Ltd, stars Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor in their fourth film together with Dara Singh, Pavan Malhotra and Saumya Tandon in supporting roles.

Primarily based in Mumbai, Bathinda and Shimla, "Jab We Met" tells the story of a feisty Punjabi girl, Geet Dhillon, who is sent off track when she bumps into a depressed Mumbai businessman, Aditya Kashyap, on an overnight train to Delhi. While attempting to get him back on board when he alights at a station stop, both are left stranded in the middle of nowhere. Having walked out of his corporate business after being dumped by his girlfriend, Aditya has no destination in mind, until Geet forces him to accompany her back home to her family, and then on to elope with her secret boyfriend, Anshuman.

Released in the United Kingdom a day before its worldwide release of 26 October 2007, the film became a hit at the Indian box office as well as overseas. The distributors of the film, Shree Ashtavinayak Cinevision Ltd, announced that "Jab We Met" would be remade by corporate entity Moser Baer in four other Indian languages: Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. However, eventually it was remade only in Tamil as "Kanden Kadhalai".

The film fetched several awards, among which was a National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer awarded to Shreya Ghoshal for the song "Yeh Ishq Haaye", which remained a chartbuster for many weeks.

Aditya Kashyap (Shahid Kapoor) is a wealthy industrialist struggling with his business and personal life. With his company in a bad condition and his girlfriend marrying another man, he becomes depressed and wanders aimlessly until he boards a train, wanting to get away from his life. Inside, he meets another passenger, Geet Dhillon (Kareena Kapoor), a bubbly, talkative Sikh girl. Irritated by her talkativeness, he lashes out at her, but she thinks nothing of it, understanding that he is upset.

When Geet sees that Aditya has gotten off the train, she disembarks to let him know the train is leaving but ends up missing it herself. Aditya reluctantly helps her get to the next station by driving the taxi himself but Geet misses the train again. Now stranded, she announces to the exasperated Aditya that she won't leave him alone until he drops her back home and the duo embark on a road trip to reach her house in Bhatinda. During the trip, they bond and Aditya begins to feel better, enjoying himself with Geet. At her home, he meets her large family, who shower him with affection for taking care of Geet and make him stay for a week. After her family tries to get Geet engaged to someone else, she decides to run away, as she has already confided in Aditya about the man she loves, Anshuman (Tarun Arora). Sure that her family wouldn’t agree to their marriage, her plan is to run away, marry Anshuman, then come back and beg for forgiveness. That night, the two flee, and her enraged family assumes she has eloped with Aditya. The two head to Manali, where Anshuman lives. She tells Aditya to come meet Anshuman with her, but Aditya, now in love with her, bids her farewell.

Nine months later, Aditya’s company is now a lot more successful and Aditya is more positive about life, having been influenced by Geet. He launches a calling card in Geet's name, which her family sees on TV. Believing Geet and Aditya are together, her uncles angrily confront Aditya, revealing that Geet has not contacted them for nine months and they have no idea where she is. Baffled by this revelation, Aditya promises that he will bring her back. He travels to Manali to meet Anshuman and discovers that Anshuman coldly rejected Geet the day Aditya dropped her off at his house.

Having learned that Geet is in Shimla, Aditya travels there and is shocked to find her as a depressed and quiet schoolteacher. He cheers her up by making her call Anshuman and swear at him, taking out all her anger. Guilt-ridden, Anshuman asks to get back together. Geet reluctantly patches up with him after Aditya advises her, though she is visibly distressed. The three of them drive back to Bhatinda and to their shock, Geet's family welcomes Geet and Aditya as a couple since they believe the two eloped, taking Anshuman to be Aditya's friend. Geet sees how Aditya and her family get along while Anshuman is rather standoffish and annoyed by them. She gets a chance to tell her mom the truth about Anshuman but can’t bring herself to do it. The preparations for their wedding begin.

The next day, Anshuman explains to Geet how the two of them will go tell her family about him and remove Aditya from the picture. As an oncoming train drowns out his words, Geet has an epiphany - she loves Aditya and he is the one for her. She runs after Aditya, who is leaving, and declares her feelings and the two finally unite. They get married and have twin daughters.


Pre-production work on the film began in early 2007 when Shree Ashtavinayak Cinevision Ltd announced that director Imtiaz Ali would be directing the then real life couple Shahid and Kareena Kapoor in their first "full-fledged romantic drama". When Ali began casting for the film, Preity Zinta was the director's first choice to portray the role of Geet Dhillon whilst actor Bobby Deol was the first choice for the role of Aditya Kashyap but Shahid replaced Bobby after Ali met him and discovered the actor was more than a poster boy, while when Preity refused to do the film the role went to Kareena. On the two lead actors, Ali commented, "I wanted a girl who could look natural in scenes where she misses the train. She had to be without make-up, someone who could be hyper, talkative and interesting but not irritating. I was never a fan of her [Kareena] and hadn't seen too many of her flicks, but I just knew Kareena was perfect as Geet [...] [On the other hand], When I met him [Shahid], I realised he wasn't the forgettable actor that he comes across in several of his movies. He has gone through a lot in life and that maturity had never been brought out. He was perfect for the role of a young, mature, quiet guy."

The film was shot throughout the Punjab region, and filming started on 20 March 2007 in Chandigarh and later headed to Shimla and Manali, where the crew filmed a song on the Himalayas and the Rohtang Pass. Manish Malhotra served as the costume designer. The summer shots in Punjab of the haveli were filmed in Nabha near Patiala. While shooting the last schedule of the film in Mumbai, sources had indicated that the lead pair had broken up. Though the media projected it as a publicity stunt for the film, it was later confirmed that the couple had indeed parted ways. The title of the film was decided by a popular vote; moviegoers had a choice between "Punjab Mail", "Ishq Via Bhatinda" ('Love via Bhatinda') and "Jab We Met".

To promote the film, the actors appeared separately on different television shows. Kareena Kapoor appeared as guest judge on the singing talent contest "Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2007" whilst Shahid Kapoor appeared on "Amul STAR Voice of India" and "Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa"; they later appeared together on the television show "Nach Baliye". Apart from this, the producers also painted two full local trains in Mumbai from the Western and Central lines with "Jab We Met" imagery, where Shahid Kapoor chatted up with fellow passengers and informed them about the movie. On the night of 23 October 2007, a special preview of the film was organized at Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai for those associated with the film and their families.

The film opened to positive reviews on 26 October 2007 with a fairly good opening of 70% all over India and later increased to 90% during the weekend. Making a total first week net business of 11.75 crores from 350 cinemas, the film went into the second week with very strong collections and saw a massive increase with 40%-50% increment in shows worldwide.

Continuing its strong march in week two with collections of over and a two-week total of , the film was declared a "hit". During its third week, "Jab We Met" managed to add another to its collections but suffered a setback due to the arrival of Farah Khan's "Om Shanti Om" and Sanjay Leela Bhansali's "Saawariya", which resulted in the number of shows for the film being reduced. Due to popular demand and the poor performance of the latter,
the following week saw an increase in the number of prints for the film across the country, and resulted in a 50% increase of the film's collections. Completing fifty successful days at the box office on 14 December 2007, the film received a "hit" status by "BoxOffice India" and continued running successfully in cinemas with greater number of shows than the much later-released, "Om Shanti Om".

As of February 2008, "Jab We Met" has made a net business of over ₹710 million (US$10.9million), and has emerged as one of the biggest hits of the year. On 30 January 2008, it was announced that to celebrate the success of its 100 days run at the box office, PVR Cinemas in Delhi would have a special screening of the film on Valentine's Day.

Meanwhile, "Jab We Met" also opened well overseas especially in the U.K., where it was released a day before its worldwide release of 26 October. Debuting at number 10 in the U.K., the film grossed £11,488 on its previews night and £144,525 on its opening weekend, collecting a total of £156,013 from 31 screens. The film continued to do strong business and garnered excellent collections during its second week, making a two-week total of £325,996. Over the next five weeks, "Jab We Met" collected a total of £43,529 from 54 screens and made a grand total of £424,681.

Upon release, the film opened to positive reviews. Critics praised the film for its simplicity, its romance, saying that it was "one of the finest romantic films to come out of Bollywood in 2007". The film's direction and performances were particularly appreciated. Taran Adarsh from "indiaFM" gave the film a 3.5 out of 5 rating saying it is "as refreshing as an ice-cold watermelon juice in scorching heat." Subhash K. Jha wrote, "..."Jab We Met" is the kind of cinematic experience that is hard to come by in this day and age of smoky cynicism and borrowed rage." Rajeev Masand from "CNN-IBN", who gave the film 3 stars out of 5, described it as "a film bursting with the kind of lovely little moments that'll bring a smile to your face. Khaled Mohamed, of the "Hindustan Times", gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying the film, "is quite a delight, particularly for the chirpy-chirpy-cheep-cheep girl and the retentive, moan-groan boy. Directed with a flair for garnishing even the most abject of circumstances with humour and irony, here’s a feel-cool movie. Wonderful.

Most critics agreed that the main highlight of the film was the leading pair and Shahid and Kareena's chemistry. Rajeev Masand further explained, "The real magic of this film lies in the performances of its two main leads who seize your attention from the moment they first appear on screen." Taran Adarsh commented, "Shahid delivers his career-best performance in "Jab We Met"... Kareena is in top form as well. "Jab We Met" is a turning point in her career [personally as well as professionally]. Fantabulous -- that's the right word to describe her work this time. The confidence with which she handles the contrasting characterization speaks volumes. This film should do for her what "Kuch Kuch Hota Hai" (1998) did for Kajol." Subhash K. Jha approved the chemistry as well, "...there are sparks...and the ones between Kareena and Shahid are so unselfconsciously genuine that you end up looking at the characters rather than the two actors going through a series of brilliantly conceived and energized incidents..." "The Times of India" gave the film 4 out of 5 stars concluding, "The film belongs to Shahid and Kareena who pitch in memorable performances and lend a whole new meaning to the boy-meets-girl story." Joginder Tuteja from "indiaglitz.com" gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, described it as "Shahid-Kareena's "DDLJ"", and concluded that "...it would be a pain if any of the two actors do not get awarded and rewarded for their performances..."

Reviews towards the director, Imtiaz Ali, were favourable as well. "Indiatimes" wrote, "After his much appreciated "Socha Na Tha" (2004), Imtiaz goes bigger and better and the result is nothing but flying colours".

"Jab We Met" remains one of the most popular romantic films in Bollywood. The film helped bring Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor's acting careers to a whole new level. The couple was named onto "Bollywood Hungama"s list of the top 10 best romantic couples of the decade. Yahoo! Movies India listed the film as one of the Bollywood's top 10 most romantic movies. The film's remake is the Tamil film Kanden Kadhalai , the film's plot inspired the Hollywood film Leap Year and television show "Love U Zindagi".

Kareena Kapoor, who had before enjoyed only some success in her films, had catapulted herself to becoming one of Bollywood's superstars. Her character, Geet Dhillon, has become one of the most popular and recognizable heroines in Bollywood. She later went on to say about her role, "To play a character like 'Geet' doesn't happen all the time; it just happens. When you begin working on a film, you of course know about the story and your character. However, no one knows how audiences would eventually react to it. 'Geet' did strike a chord with the audiences and became a household name." Kareena Kapoor, for her performance, was ranked number 66 in "Filmfare" magazine's 80 Iconic Bollywood Performances list. According to Hindi Film News, she was number 5 in the critic's top ten and number 4 in the popular top ten for the finest performance by a Bollywood actress for the decade. She was also named by Rediff as one of Bollywood's most beloved characters.

On 7 December 2007, the film was officially released on DVD in the U.S., U.K., UAE and other international markets. A single disc collector's item in an enclosed box, the DVD contained English, Portuguese, Arabic, and Spanish subtitles.

"Aaoge Jab Tum is Composed by Sandesh Shandilya and lyrics penned by Faaiz Anwar, the film's soundtrack was released on 21 September 2007 by lead actress, Kareena Kapoor on the musical show "Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2007". Joginder Tuteja from "IndiaFM" gave the music 3.5 out of 5 stars saying, "In 2007, Pritam may have been come up with good music in number of films [...] But if there is one album that impresses most after "Life in a... Metro" and turns out to be most satisfying experience, it is "Jab We Met". The album is a perfect example of how to get a quality soundtrack which mixes songs for different segments of audience." Movietalkies.com rated the album 4 out of 5 stars, describing the album as "certainly one of the better albums that have come out this year ... Pritam has shown a depth and width of imagination in the manner in which he has used so many different genres and mixed them together to create a fascinating journey of music."
The film's soundtrack debuted at number 8 and later jumped up to number 5 during its second week. Over the next several weeks, the album steadily began climbing up the music charts and saw the album sales increase after the film's release. During the week of 19 November the album replaced the soundtrack of "Om Shanti Om" and moved up to number 1 but fell back to number 2 the following week. Despite competition from the release of newer soundtracks, the album stayed at the top for over nine weeks. According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 19,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's second highest-selling.

88 Antop Hill

88 Antop Hill is a 2003 mystery thriller Hindi film. The story, screenplay and direction are by Kushan Nandy; dialogues by Ashish Deo. The film is a murder mystery and is loosely based on James Hadley Chase's novel "Tiger By The Tail".

The film opens with the brutal murder of Neeraj Shah (Sachin Dubey). His body is dumped in the trunk of a car. This crime isn't committed on impulse: Whoever did it had good reason.

We then enter the life of a bank executive Pratyush Shelar (Atul Kulkarni). He gets home late on his anniversary because he had to console an old college classmate about her marital woes. His own marital woes are worsened when his wife Antara (Suchitra Pillai) kicks up a big fight and leaves their home with their daughter Saanjh.

Pratyush is upset about this. His colleague Aslam Durrani (Harsh Khurana) picks up on this and suggests an exotic dancer Teesta (Shweta Menon). Pratyush is too upset to be interested. But Aslam is determined; later that night he calls Pratyush and pretends as though some thugs are about to kill him. He asks Pratyush to come immediately to a certain location.

That location is 88 Antop Hill.

Pratyush arrives. 88 Antop Hill is a halfway house mainly occupied by exotic dancers and escorts. Pratyush walks into the flat Aslam had mentioned; it is Teesta's lair. She attempts to seduce him but he refuses her advances. Upon her request, he takes her to the Moksha club and buys her a drink. (He doesn't drink.) She remarks that the bartender Sol (Rahul Panday) knows all her secrets. While leaving the bar, their car is attacked by an apparently drunk man, who seems to know Teesta. Teesta urges Pratyush to leave fast. When he brings her back home, he realizes that his car keys are missing. He waits as she looks for them.

When Teesta gets into her bedroom, she is mysteriously murdered. She stumbles into Pratyush's arms, fatally stabbed, and collapses. Scared and confused, Pratyush leaves immediately. One of the neighbors, a weird and on-and-off senile old fellow called Murli Mansukhani (Shauket Baig) sees him leave.

When the cops begin to investigate, they find that Teesta had a roommate Sonali (Jasmine) and that Sonali is engaged to a prominent businessman, K.K. Menon (Sanjay Singh). The investigating officer, and the hero of this movie, Inspector Arvind Khanvilkar (Rahul Dev), starts his work. The prime suspect is an unwitting Pratyush because he was the last person to see Teesta alive.

A somewhat convoluted plot evolves. Sonali has several dark secrets and a good-for-nothing brother Prashant (Subrat Dutta). Teesta was somehow connected to Sonali's dark past. Menon knows this and wanted to wipe out everything, including Prashant. He has Prashant kidnapped, and later he tells Sol to bump off Prashant. There is a three-way fight among them. Pratyush arrives upon the scene and witnesses two more murders. A dying Prashant advises Pratyush to go to Sonali at the earliest. In the meantime, the weird old man of 88 Antop Hill, Murli, recalls that he had seen Pratyush and follows him to blackmail him. When Pratyush asks him to get lost, he goes to Sonali's house and tries to blackmail her. Aslam Durrani visits Pratyush and, seeing him, thinks he has probably committed the crime, saying that Pratyush would better leave the city and that he wouldn't want anything to do with the latter anymore.

Pratyush contacts the cops but a dimwitted cop sternly asks him to surrender, as the police have found the murder weapon and a blood stained shirt, with Pratyush's diary stating 88 Antop Hill on the fateful date at his house. Pratyush panics and goes to Sonali to convey Prashant's message to her. She does not listen to what he says. Here Menon and the good inspector show up as well.

The crux arises — the inspector says that he has found out that Sonali is actually "Sonali Shah", and she was married already to the deceased Neeraj Shah; it was Sonali who killed him because he wouldn't give her a divorce to marry Menon. He also says that Neeraj's house was ransacked by Sonali to find the marriage certificate.

Arvind goes to the fridge and finds Murli Mansukhani lying stabbed in it! The truth is then out. It is known that Sonali murdered Neeraj and hid his corpse in the fridge and murdered Murli because he opened the fridge out of curiosity and found Neeraj's corpse. Arvind also reveals that Sonali killed Teesta. Sonali says it was because Teesta knew about her marriage with Neeraj, and used to blackmail her, saying she will make it known to Menon. It was Sonali who had followed Pratyush and Teesata on the fateful night back to 88 Antop Hill, secretly climbed into Teesta's bedroom and slit her throat. She further followed Pratyush and leaves the knife in his house to implicate him. It is then revealed that Menon has murdered Prashant, at which Sonali is shocked.

Menon makes a last effort to save himself and Sonali. He tries to bribe Arvind with 10 million, saying that he must arrest poor Pratyush on charges of all the murders. To this, Arvind agrees and shoots Pratyush in the shoulder. But the wounded Pratyush releases gas from the cylinder nearby and threatens to light his cigarette lighter. While he grabs Arvind's phone and tries to call police, Menon attacks him and stabs him on the sofa, and Arvind quickly turns out the gas. But the wounded Pratyush pulls out Menon's revolver, kicks him off and shoots him through a cushion.

A dumbfounded Sonali picks up a pistol and threatens to kill Pratyush. Arvind tells her not to, but she pulls the trigger — only to find that the gun is empty.

Arvind then apologizes to Pratyush, saying he had to wound the latter or else Menon would've killed Pratyush. Sonali is then arrested on charges of multiple homicide and attempt to kill Pratyush.

The film ends with the inspector relieving Pratyush of all charges in the case and requesting him to take care of a pet dog. Pratyush's wife and child return.

Baaghi (1990 film)

Baaghi: A Rebel for Love is a 1990 Bollywood romantic action drama film, starring Salman Khan, Nagma and Shakti Kapoor, which was released on 21 December 1990. It was Nagma's first role in Bollywood; as the opening credits note, she was 15 years old when the film was released. The DVD cover has a warning noting that the movie is "suitable only for persons of 15 years and older," presumably because the plot revolves around prostitution. The subtitle "A Rebel for Love" does not appear on the DVD box, nor in the Hindi titles or license at the start of the movie. According to BoxOfficeIndia.com, "Baaghi" is reported to have been Bollywood's seventh highest-grossing film in 1990, despite its release in mid-December holiday.

The movie opens with a dedication, which reads: "In this year of the girl child, we dedicate our film to those women, who have been victimised by lust and greed and are subjected to social rejection and also laud those who strive to uplift them." The movie was a hit. The story of "Baaghi: A Rebel for Love" was Salman's idea, for which he was given due credit.

The story centres on Saajan, the son of a colonel in the Indian army, and Kaajal, a modest girl from a respectable family. The film opens with Saajan travelling in a bus, when he catches a glimpse of Kaajal on another bus, and they are both smitten. They do not formally meet and, since Saajan is off to start at college, he does not think he will ever see her again. But his new friends at college, Buddha, Tempo and Refill, one night insist on visiting a brothel in a seedier part of Bombay. Saajan only reluctantly agrees, but ultimately refuses to select a prostitute — until he hears a new girl being beaten by her pimp and decides to protect her. To his surprise, it is Kaajal (called Paro at the brothel), who has been kidnapped by a pimp after she was tricked by a job offer in Bombay.

Kaajal, who has only very recently arrived at the brothel and is still a virgin, has adamantly refused to be a prostitute. This is why Jaggu, who runs the brothel, is beating her. When finally alone with Saajan as a paying client (although he does not do anything with her), Kaajal explains to him how she was forced to look for work after her parents' deaths: This ultimately led to her travelling to Bombay and being kidnapped by Dhanraj and forced to work in Jaggu's brothel. Thanks to Leelabai, the madame who helps run the brothel, Saajan is able to spend time with Kaajal, and Kaajal is somehow able to resist becoming a prostitute. Saajan and Kaajal fall in love, and he tries to find a way to get her out of the brothel before Kaajal gives up hope.

When Saajan is finally able to introduce Kaajal to his parents, they — not surprisingly — reject the idea of his marrying a girl from a brothel, even if she was taken there against her will and is from a respectable family. Since Saajan's father, Col. Sood, was already angry with his son for refusing to follow family tradition to join the Indian army, this is the last straw. Saajan is kicked out of his house. He becomes, in his own words, a rebel, a word which is repeated several times in the movie. Since Kaajal is already rebelling against Jaggu because she believes in love, they are now both "rebels for love." Saajan's college friends help Kaajal escape the brothel and flee to Ooty, near where her grandparents live. But just as they are about to be married with Kaajal's grandparents' consent, if not Saajan's father's, police arrive and take them back to Bombay, where they claim he's wanted for kidnapping "Paro".

Saajan's father, on hearing of his heroics fighting Dhanraj's men to rescue Kaajal, has a new-found respect for his son, who had previously been a lazy drifter. With the help of Saajan's friends, Col. Sood finds his son outside Jaggu's brothel. There the "police" (who are actually working for Dhanraj) have returned Saajan and Kaajal to Dhanraj, who is preparing to punish them for her leaving the brothel. The intervention of Leelabai on Kaajal's behalf leads to yet another fight, with several people switching alliances.


The soundtrack has nine songs composed by Anand-Milind, with lyrics by Sameer. The music was hugely popular when it released and enjoys the honour of being played on radio stations even today. The most popular song of this film is "Kaisa Lagta Hai," sung by Anuradha Paudwal and Amit Kumar. Abhijeet and Anand-Milind went on to record several songs together since. Music was

The songs "Tapori" and "Chandni Raat Hai" were lifted from Illayaraja's movies, "Agni Natchathiram" and "Pudhu Pudhu Arthangal", respectively.

Anand-Milind were nominated at the Filmfare awards for Best Music, but lost to Nadeem-Shravan for "Aashiqui". A minor controversy arose when singer Amit Kumar was mistakenly nominated for "Chandini Raat Hai" at the Filmfare awards ceremony.

<doc id="9890983" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9890983" title="Drohkaal">
Drohkaal

Drohkaal () is a 1994 Indian crime drama film directed and produced by Govind Nihalani, which deals with India's fight against terrorism. The film examines the mental and psychological trauma that honest police officers go through in their fight against a group of ruthless terrorists. It was remade simultaneously in Tamil and Telugu languages as "Kuruthipunal" and "Drohi" produced by Kamal Haasan and directed by P. C. Sreeram, which was India's official entry for the 68th Academy Awards Best Foreign Language Film category.

Indian cities are being terrorized by a group of people who want the government to give in to their demands and are willing to go to any extent for that purpose. Honest, experienced and diligent cops Abhay Singh (Om Puri) and Abbas Lodhi (Naseeruddin Shah) are part of the anti-terrorism task force set up by the government to eliminate the menace.

Abbas Lodhi comes up with the idea of "Operation Dhanush", which involves sending two undercover cops, Anand (Manoj Bajpai) and Shiv (Milind Gunaji) among the terrorist group, so that they shall be part of them and learn all about them, and can call him through radio and transmit all the information under the code name Dhanush. Only Abbas and Abhay know about this operation.

Anand, one of the undercover cops, is exposed by the terrorists a few years later. However, he dies by consuming cyanide before they can get any information from him. Now Shiv is left alone in the gang. He soon wins the trust and respect of everyone in the gang, including the mastermind Commander Bhadra (Ashish Vidyarthi) himself.

Bhadra is captured and tortured by the police. But try as they may, he does not reveal anything to Abbas or Abhay. When Bhadra is in jail, the gang appoints one of their sharpshooters to kill a minister as he is approaching the city in his car, which he does successfully. This man is apprehended and interrogated by Abhay. He agrees to help the police for the safety of his family, but soon is poisoned in jail itself by a corrupt cop, Inspector Tiwari (Shrivallabh Vyas).

Soon one of Abhay and Lodhi's trusted and highly respected officers, and good friends, IGP Pathak (Amrish Puri), commits suicide when the CBI come to arrest him on charges of being linked with the terrorists. This comes as a rude shock for Abhay and Lodhi. They now realize that there are people all over who seem to be linked with the terrorists. Now Bhadra offers Abhay the chance to join with and help the terrorists, or else his family will be in danger. Abhay does not oblige. The terrorists shoot the family dog, killing it, shoot at Abhay's son's leg and injure him, and send messages directly and indirectly to threaten him.

Abhay finally agrees. Bhadra asks for Abhay to sham a fake kidnap drama and allow him to escape, which he unwillingly does. Lodhi is shocked at Bhadra's escape, but he does not understand why Abhay is acting strangely.

Now outside, Bhadra soon send two people, Surinder (Annu Kapoor) and Mala to stay in Abhay's house, and asks the latter to accommodate them. The two of them keep Bhadra informed about everything, and threaten to kill Abhay's wife and child if he were to try anything funny at any time. Only Abhay knows about their true identity.

Soon Bhadra meets Abhay, and under threat of his wife and child being killed by Bhadra's signaling to the couple at their house, Abhay reveals that it was Lodhi who had arranged for two undercover cops to be sent to the gang, and only he knows 'who' Dhanush really is. Abhay also comes to know that Inspector Tiwari, who was supporting Bhadra, has been eliminated.

The gang attacks Lodhi. He almost starts to finish them off, when he sees that one of the people sent to capture him is Shiv, so he goes along with them. Lodhi is beaten, but he does not reveal who the inside man is. Soon he is killed accidentally by Bhadra's pistol. The shock of all that is happening is too much for Abhay to bear. He tells everything to Sumitra (Mita Vashisht), who tells Abhay that as a Police officer, he had taken an oath to protect the nation, and he must go by that. She also says that she will take care of everyone and everything if he were not there.

Consoled, Abhay is then called for a late night meeting by Bhadra again. When he leaves for Lodhi's house first, Surinder tries to attack and rape a girl being taken care of by Abhay and his wife. At this point, Mala orders Surinder at gunpoint to leave the girl, but Surinder shoots Mala. Sumitra sees all this, and in order to save him, seduces Surinder. Once in the bedroom, she pushes Surinder off, and kills him with her own gun.

Abhay Singh is informed and he returns home, and consoles his family and bids them goodbye. He goes to meet Bhadra, where he attacks the criminal and is overpowered and bound to a chair. With only Shiv in the room, Commander Bhadra asks Abhay about the inside man, and suddenly points the pistol at Shiv. Abhay jumps off, attacks Bhadra, breaks free and stabs him in the neck with the broken wood of the chair. On hearing the commotion, as the entire gang comes from outside to break into the room, Abhay tells Shiv to shoot him, because then it will appear as though Abhay was killed when he attacked Bhadra, and Shiv being highly trusted, would become the new gang leader. A reluctant Shiv does so, just as the gang breaks in. Shiv declares himself to be the terrorist gang leader, and the others accept his leadership. Abhay Singh passes away in peace.


A. R. Rahman was supposed to debut as music director in Bollywood with "Drohkaal", but his computer which contained the music for the film crashed and he never got to start over.

Ashish Vidyarthi won the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor. His performance was cited as "bringing credibility to his role with strength and total conviction". In 1996, Mita Vasisht won the Star Screen Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 1995, Nihalani won the Best Director Award at the Damascus International Film Festival for the film.

Yaarana (1981 film)

Yaarana () previously titled Yaar Mera is a 1981 Indian musical drama film directed by Rakesh Kumar, starring Amitabh Bachchan, Amjad Khan, Neetu Singh, Tanuja and Kader Khan. This was one of the films where Amjad Khan plays a positive role. Nearly all of his other films with Amitabh Bachchan have been had him playing a villain role. This movie was a 'Runaway Blockbuster. One of the highlights of the film was its music by Rajesh Roshan and lyrics by Anjaan. Three songs, "Chhookar Mere Mann Ko," "Tere Jaisa Yaar Kahan," and "Saara Zamana Haseeno Ka Deewana" were super-hits and are still loved. "Saara Zamana Haseeno Ka Deewana" is particularly noteworthy because of Amitabh Bachchan's dance with clothes fitted with electric bulbs, which he himself operated from under his clothing, maintaining complete synchronization while dancing.

Kishan and Bishan are childhood friends. Kishan is an orphan, but is self-sufficient and hard-working, while Bishan comes from an affluent background. The friendship between the two is extremely strong and is the bane of Bishan's uncle, who has his eyes on his widowed sister's wealth. In a bid to separate the two friends, the uncle manipulates his sister into sending Bishan away to the city and then abroad for further education.

When the two friends reunite years later, Bishan (Amjad Khan) discovers that Kishan (Amitabh Bachchan) has a great voice. Bishan is now a successful businessman and he wants to promote Kishan's singing talent. Kishan goes to the city with his friend, where Bishan asks Komal (Neetu Singh) to groom him to be a performer and a gentleman. Kishan tries to get expelled from the process by being uncooperative and disruptive. In the meantime, Bishan discovers that the family wealth has been systematically looted over the last 18 years by the uncle and his son. He is forced to borrow by mortgaging his remaining assets in order to ensure that Kishan becomes a successful singer. This causes a major rift between Bishan and his wife, who is convinced that Kishan will turn his back on his friend if he were to ever succeed. Kishan's debut concert is a huge success and he goes on to donate the proceeds of his earnings and consequent record deals in order to rid his friend Bishan of his many mortgages and in order to help woo his estranged sister-in-law and lovable nephew (Bishan's 10-year-old son) back into the house.

Kishan proceeds to become a star and Komal (Neetu Singh) - his trainer professes her love for him. Bishan in the meanwhile falls into a conspiracy further set by his treacherous uncle (Jeevan) and cousin (Ranjeet). He is kidnapped alongside several hostages - primarily children on his shipping vessel, brainwashed, tortured and forced to sign a confession that all the misdeeds have been done by him. Bishan loses his mental stability and goes into shock.

He is then thrown into an asylum after he has a breakdown and experiences amnesia. Kishan pretends to be mentally ill and admits himself into the asylum by tricking the authorities and saves his friend by reviving his memory successfully by feeding him rotis as he used to when they were children.

The climax follows the typical action confrontation formula reminiscent of films in that era where there are big explosions and the heroes single-handedly take on hordes of goons. The movie ends with the children - hostages being saved, the family uniting and the treacherous mastermind (Ranjeet) being sent to jail.


The soundtrack was composed by Rajesh Roshan. The song "Sara Zamana" was recreated as "Haseeno Ka Deewana" for the film "Kaabil" by Rajesh Roshan, and this was the first time to recreate his own song, which was the first song of first two own recreations.

Anarkali (1953 film)

Anarkali is a 1953 Indian historical drama film, directed by Nandlal Jaswantlal, and written by Nasir Hussain and Hameed Butt, based on the historical legend of the Mughal emperor Jahangir (Salim).

Shahenshah Jalal-ud-din Akbar is the grandson of Babur, and the son of Humayun. He is known to have ruled over Hindustan with a humane and just heart. He knew in order to garner the support of the Hindus, he must treat them sensitively, allow them to worship freely, and in order to maintain this peace, he married Jodha Bai, a Hindu Rajput, the sister of Raja Bhagwant Das. Through this marriage they became the proud parents of Shehzada Salim (Jahangir). Akbar first met Nadira in the Anar garden, while she was awaiting the arrival of her lover. So pleased he was with her that he wanted to reward her, but she only asked for an Anar, so he ended up bestowing her with the name of 'Anarkali'. He met her the second time when she was able to revive Salim, who was seriously wounded in a war in Kabul. Once again Akbar was pleased with her, wanted to reward her, but again she turned him down. The third time she ended up annoying Akbar when she sang and danced in his court under the influence of alcohol, and he has her imprisoned. The very foundations of Akbar's palace will be shaken to the roots, and his manner of meting out justice will be put to the extreme test, when he finds out that Salim is in love with Anarkali and wants to marry her. While Akbar may have been successful to end the strife between Hindus and Muslims, but will be able to break down the wall between the rich and the poor?


The composer Vasant Prakash was initially appointed as the Music Director of this film, but fell out with the film producer S. Mukerji after having recorded just one song with Geeta Dutt. Prakash had intended for all of the female songs in this film to be given to Geeta Dutt. The composer C. Ramchandra took over the project, and insisted not only that all of the female songs be sung by Lata Mangeshkar, but that the Geeta Dutt number also be removed from the film. Although the Filmistan group agreed, the Geeta song stayed in the movie, the famous "Aa Jaan-e-Wafaa".

Vedhicka, Rajkiran and Rahul Dev among other play supporting roles, while the film's score is composed by S. P. Venkatesh, while the songs were composed by Bharathwaj. The film released on 9 March 2007 along with a Telugu dubbed version of same name and gained positive reviews and huge box office collections. Later, it was dubbed into Hindi as "Pratisodh: Ek Real Revenge" in 2011. In 2011, a sequel titled "" was released by Raghava Lawrence. It was the first installment in the "Muni" film series.

Ganesh (Raghava Lawrence), a young man with a deep fear of ghosts who refuses go out after 6PM, moves into a new house with his mother (Kovai Sarala), father (Vinu Chakravarthy), and wife Priya (Vedhicka). All of a sudden, Ganesh is possessed by a ghost and starts behaving in a rude manner; his family cannot understand his behaviour, so they seek the help of a priest named Andaiyar (Nassar).

Ramanaa

Ramanaa, also known as Ramana, is a 2002 Indian Tamil-language vigilante action film written and directed by A. R. Murugadoss, starring Vijayakanth, Ashima Bhalla, and Simran in the lead roles. The film is about a man named Ramana who decides to abolish corruption completely with the help of his ex-students who are working in various government offices. The film received positive reviews from both film critics and audiences. It was awarded the 2002 Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Film and A. R. Murugadoss won the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Dialogue Writer.

In 2015, the film was dubbed into Hindi as "Mar Mitenge 3".

"Ramanaa" begins with the abduction of 15 Tahsildars. After three days in captivity, 14 officers are released, but one is murdered. The police find a tape recording and a file on the dead officer's body that provide significant evidence concerning the kidnapping and subsequent murder. The file suggests that the crimes were committed by members of the self-proclaimed "Anti-Corruption Force" (ACF), a citizen militia seeking to eliminate corruption through vigilante acts. The militia, acting as a kangaroo court, "sentenced" corrupt officials in the area to death, beginning with the captured revenue officers who were apparently engaging in criminal activity.

The film's setting then shifts to M. Ramanaa, a mild-mannered professor at National College, who lives in a house with four adopted kids. While treating his adopted child at a big private hospital, Ramanaa discovers that the officials at the facility are engaging in extortion and fraud. After collecting evidence of the hospital staff's deception, Ramanaa turns them over to the authorities. The ringleader is the hospital dean, Rishi, who commits suicide when this is discovered. His grief-stricken father, a big and powerful construction magnate named Bhadrinarayanan, vows to take revenge on the man responsible for his son's death. Meanwhile, the ACF goes on kidnapping the top 15 corrupt officials each month and then killing the #1. Those officials include officials from transport, PWD, revenue, sports, health, etc. Then, suddenly, Devaki, a college girl and friend of Ramana's kids, finds out about him being the leader of the ACF. She questions him about this immoral activity.

Seven years ago, Ramana was a college professor with a small cute family, of him, his nine-month pregnant wife Chitra, and his daughter. During the festival of Deepavali, Ramanaa's apartment building collapses due to heavy construction work near-by, killing many residents including Chitra and his daughter. Recovering from the incident, he demands to know who was responsible for the building's collapse. He discovers that the building was built and owned by Bhadrinarayanan, who knowingly constructed the complex on loose soil. When Ramanaa confronts the District Council with evidence, Bhadrinarayanan walks in and boasts about all the bribe he has thrown to the top district officials including the collector. he gives Ramanaa a chance to call any two top officials in the state and get him arrested, but both the officials who are called immediately hang up. Frustrated, Ramanaa seals the room and attacks all officers, and as he is about to kill Bhadrinarayanan, he is beaten badly by his men, and is thrown on a highway. He is then rescued by National college students, who were on a trip. In response to Bhadrinarayanan's actions, and the general corruption in the region, Ramanaa forms the Anti-Corruption Force (ACF). Ramanaa and the ACF ultimately capture and hang Bhadrinarayanan, along with other corrupt government officials.

Meanwhile, a local police constable, frustrated for being not promoted, as he could not bribe officials, begins secretly building the case against the ACF. The constable eventually realizes that the ACF is primarily composed of people who do not take bribes. He visits multiple revenue offices, but his superiors neglect him due to him being their low associate. Then, a message comes saying that civil supply officers are going to be taken. All corrupt officials try to get police protection by proving their corruption, but at the last moment, the ACF switches to Police department. All corrupt civil supply officers are arrested, and the government promises to employ 25,000 youngsters within a week. 15 district police chiefs are kidnapped. The police officer is killed, and everyone is frustrated. An IPS Punjabi officer is flown from Delhi to head the case.

Meanwhile, Bhadrinarayanan is trying to re-corrupt the officials. As the final stroke, the top 15 dons are kidnapped. Ramanaa personally comes to Bhadrinarayanan. As was done to him, he gives the same lifeline to Bhadri, to call any two people within India. This time, Bhadrinarayanan fails, and is kidnapped and later killed. Then, the constable reveals his plan to his superiors, and the IPS officer is delighted.

The officer takes swift action against them. The ACF members are captured and tortured by the police but refuse to reveal Ramanaa's identity. Ramanaa is overcome with guilt over his students' sacrifice and surrenders himself, on the condition that all the other members of the ACF be released. He is tried and convicted of being the mastermind organiser behind the murders of Bhadrinarayanan and 14 other government officials, and is sentenced to death. Public pressure from the sympathetic community and family makes the Chief Minister offer Ramanaa a pardon appeal, which will definitely give him complete freedom. However, Ramanaa refuses, stating that only he must face the consequences of his actions, and is hanged the next day. The constable is offered a promotion for his role in disbanding the ACF, but he refuses out of guilt.

Yugi Sethu replaced R. Madhavan in a role in the film.

"Ramanaa" was remade in a variety of different languages and casts. The Telugu version "Tagore" was an instant blockbuster along with its Hindi version "Gabbar is Back". The 2015 Bangladeshi film "Warning" was an unofficial remake of this movie.The 2005 Kannada film "Vishnu Sena" was an official remake of this movie.The 2007 Bengali Film "Tiger" was an official remake of this movie.

The film was a critical and commercial success. It served as a trendsetter in later years. The film had a strong cult following till date.

The "Ramanaa" soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja, and is the only collaboration by Murugadoss and Ilaiyaraaja. The soundtrack has 8 songs.

Ek Phool Do Mali

Ek Phool Do Mali is a 1969 Indian Hindi film directed by Devendra Goel. The film is based on the book "Do Kadam Aage" by Sampat Lal Purohit. The film became a hit at the box office in 1969. Balraj Sahni earned a Filmfare nomination as Best Supporting Actor. The story was miscredited to Mushtaq Jalili, and is said to have been an inspired adaptation of the Hollywood classic Fanny (1961), which is debated.

Sonam is a poor woman living with her widowed mom, Leela, in the mountainous region of India and Nepal. She makes a living working on the apple farm of the wealthy widower, Kailash Nath Kaushal. Kaushal also runs a mountaineering school where Amar Kumar is one of his students. Sonam and Amar meet, fall in love and decide to get married shortly after Amar returns from a climbing expedition. A few days later, following an avalanche, they get the news that Amar and the other climbers have been killed.

A devastated Sonam is molested by Shamsher Singh. Kailash comes to her rescue and offers to marry her when he finds out that she is pregnant. They get married and Sonam gives birth to a boy, Bobby. Shamsher is arrested and sent to jail for 6 years. Kailash, who is unable to have children after an accident, is thrilled to be a father. He adores and is inseparable from Bobby. Five years later, Sonam and Kailash, while celebrating Bobby's 6th birthday, get a shock when Amar shows up at the party.

Bobby loves his father (Kailash) but can't help but become close with Amar, his biological father, much to Sonam and Kailash's dismay. Sonam forbids Bobby from meeting Amar, but Kailash supports him and tells Sonam all he wants is to see Bobby happy. Sonam confronts Amar and confesses that she does not want him to visit anymore. Amar is distressed by this and vows to stop seeing Bobby.

During a walk with Kailash, Bobby sees Amar and tries to catch up to him, but ends up in a dynamite zone, injuring himself in the process. At the hospital, the doctor states that his condition is bad as he has lost a lot of blood. Kailash offers to give blood, but his type does not match. Amar then offers his blood, which saves Bobby's life. Kailash is glad that Bobby is alive, but cannot get over the fear of Amar taking him away.

Amar pieces together the facts and realises that Bobby is indeed his son. Just as Kailash feared, he comes to take him away while Bobby is unconscious. Sonam stops him and explains to him that Bobby is not his son nor her son but Kailash's son. She explains to him that he saved her dignity by marrying her in spite of knowing the truth and how he loved Bobby more than anyone else and raised him like his own son. Kailash overhears the whole conversation secretly. Amar, saddened by this, regrets his actions and decides to let Kailash keep Bobby and leaves them forever.

Kailash asks Sonam to get back together with Amar and take Bobby with them, but she refuses. Just as Amar leaves the next day, much to Bobby's dismay, Shamsher returns to the house and kidnaps Bobby in demand for a ransom as well as Sonam. However, Bobby escapes Shamsher's clutches and spots Amar in the distance. He runs after Amar, but Shamsher gets hold of him once more and Kailash and Sonam step in to rescue him. Kailash fights Shamsher, but is eventually beaten. Shamsher throws Bobby of a cliff and chases after Sonam.

When all seems lost, Amar steps in having seen the happenings from the mountain and fights Shamsher. Bobby is shown to be alive clinging on to a branch of the cliff side. Amar knocks Shamsher to the ground and descends using a rope, to rescue Bobby as the branch begins to snap. Shamsher returns and tries to cut the rope. He easily overpowers Sonam until Kailash intervenes. Despite all the thrashing Shamsher gives to Kailash, he refuses to let go of the rope. In a fit of rage, Shamsher runs towards him hoping to tackle him to the ground, but Kailash uses the last of his strength to kick him off the cliff side where Shamsher plummets to his death; the rope then cuts his hands further and becomes too slippery for him to hold any longer, and slips out of his grasp—but Amar has already reached the top of the cliff and climbs back over.

Amar climbs to safety with Bobby. Along with Sonam, he tries to help Kailash, but it is too late for him. Kailash, in his last few moments, states that he is happy that Bobby is alive and tells Amar to take good care of him. All three mourn of the loss of Kailash.

A few years later, Amar and Sonam are shown to be together and are admitting Bobby to the school in Uhuru. The headmaster asks for Bobby's last name and assumes it to be Amar. Amar states that is not true and declares him to be Bobby Kailash, the son of Kailash Nath Kaushal. The film ends with all three looking into the horizon.

Kashmir Ki Kali

Kashmir Ki Kali () is a 1964 Indian romance film directed by Shakti Samanta. It is loosely based on the American film "Come September" (1961). The film stars Shammi Kapoor, Sharmila Tagore in her debut role, Pran, Dhumal, Nazir Hussain and Anoop Kumar. The music was composed by O.P. Nayyar and the lyrics penned by S.H. Bihari. It became the sixth-highest-grossing film of the year and was declared a hit at the box office. The film was remade in Telugu as "Srungara Ramudu"

Wealthy and pampered Rajiv Lal (Shammi Kapoor) is the only son of widowed Rani Maa. At the silver jubilee anniversary of the mill that his father, the late Sanjiv Lal opened, he announces a bonus of 5 lakh rupees for all the workers, annoying his mother. A servant at the house, Karuna (Mridula Rani), suggests marrying him off to stop his immature antics, to which Rani Maa agrees. Her manager, Shyamlal, arranges for her to meet some girls, as she insists that Rajiv will marry a girl of her choice. Rajiv returns home and sees all the girls – he correctly surmises that his mother is getting him married, and he pretends to be a mute who walks with a limp in order to chase all the prospective suitors off. His plan succeeds, although he is in a dilemma as his mother is furious at him. One of his friends suggests that he should go away to their bungalow in Kashmir – after all, Rani Maa never goes there.

Upon arrival in Kashmir, he finds that his estate manager, Bholaram (Dhumal), has made a hotel out of their bungalow and has rented out some rooms for the season. He tells the tenants that he is Rajiv Lal, although when he meets Bholaram, the latter informs him that Rani Maa had called him, and told him not to let Rajiv stay at the bungalow, should he come. Rajiv manages to convince Bholaram to tell Rani Maa that he is not there. Bholaram tells the tenants in the house that Rajiv is mad, and in his madness, thinks that he is the real owner of the estate.

The next day, Rajiv meets Champa (Sharmila Tagore), a girl who sells flowers for a living. He buys her flowers for 20 rupees when they are priced at 5, and tells her that he is not the owner, but the driver. Soon enough, after a few misadventures, they fall in love and decide to marry, but there are a few obstacles. First of all, Mohan (Pran), the forest manager, has loaned out some money to Champa's father, Dinu (Nazir Hussain), and he insists on marrying Champa if Dinu cannot repay the debt.

Things become complicated when Mohan finds out that Dinu is not Champa's real father, and he blackmails Dinu into getting Champa married to him, or else he will let out the secret to Champa. Champa still continues to meet Rajiv on the sly, but all of that comes to an end when three girls, who are tenants in his house, reveal in her presence that he is not the driver, but the owner of the estate. Feeling betrayed, Champa runs off. Before Rajiv can go after her, he receives a trunk call from his mother, and he is informed that Karuna is seriously ill.

After telling Bholaram to explain everything to Champa, he leaves for Bombay, and finds Karuna on her deathbed, with Rani Maa at her side. Karuna tells Rajiv that he is not the real son of Rani Maa and that his biological father is none other than her brother, Dinu. Many years ago, Dinu had sold him off to Karuna for alcohol, and Rani Maa had taken him in. Soon after, Rani Maa gave birth to a baby girl, but Dinu abducted her, intending to kill her so that Rajiv will be the sole heir to Rani Maa's wealth.

However, on the way, Dinu tripped and fell, and loses his eyesight, so he does not kill the girl. Rajiv is shocked at the revelation, but more so is Rani Maa, who had assumed that her baby girl was still-born. Before Karuna can say who the girl is, she dies. Shyamlal informs the two that the day Karuna fell ill, a man from Kashmir had come to see her and asked about Rani Maa's girl, but Karuna hadn't told him anything. The man turns out to be Mohan. Rajiv and Rani Maa head back to Kashmir to find out who the girl is, and Rajiv, acting on a tip from Bholaram, goes to confront Mohan.

He beats Mohan unconscious, and Mohan's friend tells Rajiv who the girl is – Champa. He goes to find her and finds out that she is getting married to Mohan in a few days. Dinu returns home and Champa questions him. He lies to her at first, but when Rajiv drops a hint that he is the son that Dinu had sold all those years ago, the latter hugs him and admits that Champa is not his daughter. Rani Maa comes in and finds Champa, and the two embrace. Mohan arrives with his goons and decides to forcibly marry Champa.

Dinu tries to stop him, but Mohan beats him badly. The goons tie Rajiv up and then take Rani Maa and Champa to the wedding venue forcibly. Back at Rajiv's bungalow, Chander (Anoop Kumar), Rajiv's friend, and Shyamlal decide to go after them and see why they are taking so long. Rajiv manages to escape from his captors, but Dinu is still unconscious. He meets with Chander and Shyamlal on the way and tells them to get the police while he goes after Mohan.

He breaks into Mohan's hideout and stops the wedding ceremony. A fight ensues, and Mohan runs off, Rajiv hot on his tail. The police arrive soon after and arrests all of Mohan's goons. Meanwhile, Rajiv and Mohan get into a fight, and the police come to take the latter away. The film ends with a shot of Rajiv and Champa, happily married, driving away in his car.

His father, concerned with his son's declining exam scores, confronts Kittu on his obsession and later tears down the posters. To Kittu, this is almost as bad as murder and decides to move out and away to Mumbai, where the star, herself, lives.

Unknowing of where to go, he goes to her bungalow, but the security guard shoos him away. He finds a job at a nearby cafe. After interacting with Malika, Kittu soon finds that she is not the girl that he had pictured from her posters and movies. Being a simple orphan, exploited by her evil uncle and his family, Kittu begins to feel sorry for her and even more in love.

A series of events lead him to the point where he decides to convince her to run away with him. But with her being such a famous icon, Kittu soon finds it harder than he had thought to get away. The police are looking for her as is her family; and after a visit to the home of Kittu's family, as well, they are soon helping Malika enjoy her newfound freedom.

Things take a turn for the worse when Mr. Mathur is taken into custody for allegedly housing the "kidnapped" Malika. The police beat Kittu for information.

They visit her on set one day to see that she has returned to her old life, uncle-free, but this meeting is an uncomfortable one. Through her awkward goodbye, Kittu then realizes that she believes that Kittu is going to marry Nisha.

After this realization, he then runs to Malika's dressing room from the cab to tell her of his love and the fact that she has assumed wrong. They have a heartfelt conversation of love and life, and Malika goes on to explain that she thinks that Nisha and Kittu have a love that she cannot come between. She then asks him not to see her anymore and he runs to Nisha to tell her of this belief. After hearing this, Nisha explains the situation that she loves Kittu, but Kittu has always been in love with Malika. Malika and Kittu embrace to express their love.

The closing scene shows that they get married and everyone in the story was there, including his coworkers from the cafe and the taxi driver. The wicked uncle is nowhere to be seen.

However, as Gujjar attempts to escape with the terrified Roopa, her brother comes to her rescue, only to be slain, much to the horror of the village, especially Roopa. Also, her best friend, Gopal (Master Om Kapoor), is killed too, much to the dismay of Gopal's mother (Tanvi Azmi) who tried to prevent her son from rescuing Roopa (due to his young age) which is what led Gujjar to kill him. Roopa, enraged by the fact that her brother and Gopal are no more, vows vengeance.

Gujjar threatens Roopa that she will only be his mistress and will never be able to have a brother nor lover. Enraged, Roopa attempts to commit suicide by jumping into a waterfall as she finds it better to kill herself rather than be a mistress. Destiny has other plans as Roopa survives and she steals the clothes of Kishan (Aamir Khan), a theatre actor. Kishan works with his best friend, truck driver, Shankar (Faisal Khan). When Kishan meets Roopa for the first time, he is smitten by her beauty and falls in love with her. Kishan decides to make Roopa the heroine of their dance show, however, Shankar warns him that Roopa will bring them in trouble. With no option, Roopa travels with them, and she tries to escape, but returns when chased by the gang and a drunk who tries to rape her. However, Roopa is saved by Shankar and Kishan. Roopa feigns love for Kishan, who wants to marry her, and the two men agree to help her return to Chandanpur. When Kishan is going to marry Roopa, who feels guilty over her betrayal, led, she tells them her story.

Shankar becomes her brother, while Kishan, heartbroken, leaves in disgust. Roopa and Shankar return to Chandanpur, where Shankar mobilises the village, attempting to set a trap for Gujjar who has learnt of Roopa's survival and terrorizes the village to find out her whereabouts. The trap backfires horribly until Kishan returns with a suspended cop Pakkad Singh (Johny Lever). The trap is re-set with another carnival and the villains' attack as planned. Roopa is kidnapped and Kishan and Shankar give chase and are captured and taken to Gujjar's hideout where they are forced to fight him and his men. Eventually with the arrival of Chandanpur's villagers, good prevails and the terrorists meet a gory end. Roopa is united with her brother Shankar and her lover Kishan.

At the end Kishan and Roopa get married and while driving their truck, Shankar happens to meet Champakali (Aishwarya Rai) and Kishan and Roopa watch them.

Preetam (Ganesh) is on a visit to Eva Mall in Bangalore; amidst a heavy wind, he spots a pretty girl, Nandini (Pooja Gandhi). While staring at her, he inadvertently falls into a manhole. Nandini rescues him from the pit, but in the process loses her heart-shaped watch she had just bought.

While accompanying his mother to Madikeri in Coorg, Preetam confronts a man named Jaanu (Neenaasam Ashwath). Jaanu, who has been following Nandini, beats Preetam thinking that he is in love with Nandini. Preetam, unaware that Jaanu has vowed not to allow anyone near Nandini, trashes Jaanu and his gang in revenge.

In Madikeri, Preetam unexpectedly meets Nandini. He identifies himself and expresses his love towards her and offers to tie the watch as an indication for their marriage. Nandini, who is already engaged, rejects his request. Nonetheless, Preetam vows to marry Nandini if she meets him again. In the meantime, Preetam discovers that his nearly-deaf host in Madikeri, Col. Subbaiah, is Nandini's father and that Nandini's marriage is only a week away. Dejected, Preetam throws Nandini's heart-shaped watch away. But Nandini telephones him and taunts him to return. Delighted, Preetam goes in search of her watch and spots a rabbit, which he calls Devadas, and brings it along with the watch.

Since Nandini's friends are due to arrive from Mumbai for the marriage, Preetam takes Nandini to the railway station. The train is delayed by five hours, so Nandini and Preetam decide to visit a nearby hill-temple. While returning from the temple, Preetam and Nandini are caught in rain. An old couple offers Preetam and Nandini to take shelter inside their hut. Preetam, still in two minds about expressing his love to Nandini, grabs a couple of toddy bottles, goes out in the rain and starts drinking. However, when Nandini walks towards him, offering an umbrella, he is under a state of intoxication and tells Nandini that he'd better stay away from Nandini to remain a decent boy, rather than to propose or elope with her.

Nandini is now in love with Preetam and is in a dilemma as her wedding is due in a few days. She asks him to take her to the top of a waterfall where she expresses her love for him while standing at the edge.

Preetam, intent on marrying Nandini, takes Col. Subbaiah for a morning jog to discuss the matter. But Col. Subbaiah, a heart patient, tells Preetham that he's expected to die anytime and his only aim in life is to get Nandini married to Gautam also an army officer who saved his life one day during a war. Also he sees the fear in Nandini's mother when she sensed Nandini could be in love with someone else as the wedding was to happen the next day and all invitations were out. Also she felt it would be very unfair to a good person like Gautham. Hence Preetam decides to sacrifice his love for a greater good and let Gautham marry Nandini. The night before the wedding, an extremely depressed Preetam goes to a road-side bar to drink. Gautam arriving for his wedding cemoney, with heavy rains and interior broken roads of Coorg, asks the bar-owner for directions to Col. Subbaiah's home; when Jaanu tries to kill Gautam, Preetam saves Gautam and convinces Jaanu that only Gautam is the best person to marry Nandini.

The next day, Preetam brings Gautam to the marriage house as Gautam was getting late and his car had issue. They reached just in time for the ceremony, but Preetam declines to attend. Gautam asks for the heart-shaped watch as a remembrance but Preetham leaves, unwilling to part with it. There is a search for Preetam, and only his mother knows the truth about his love, but hides her worry.

Resignedly, Preetam watches the arch proclaiming "Gautham weds Nandini" and the marriage taking place in Kodava style. As he leaves, he spots Devadas and takes it with him. Driving towards Bangalore, Preetham confides in Devdas as to how much he loved Nandini, how he wished he had a life with her, and soon realizes that Devdas has died. The film ends with Preetham burying Devdas.

Chor Machaaye Shor

Chor Machaye Shor (translation: "Cry of A Thief") is a 2002 Bollywood action comedy film. The plot of this film is based on the 1999 Hollywood film "Blue Streak" (which itself is a remake of the 1965 British film "The Big Job") and the 1979 Bollywood film "Gol Maal".

Shyam (Bobby Deol) is a small-time thief who works as a security guard at a museum. He devises a plan with his three friends: Johnny (Rajpal Yadav), Titu (Ashish Vidyarthi) and Tony (Rajat Bedi) to steal a particular Nizam diamond. The foursome successfully manages to steal the diamond only for Shyam to double-cross Titu and Tony. Johnny and Shyam escape with the diamond. Johnny escapes but Shyam is apprehended, before which he hides the diamond in an air duct of a dilapidated building. Shyam is sentenced for 2 years in prison.

2 years have passed and a freshly released Shyam heads towards the dilapidated building which housed the diamond, but much to his amazement, a new police headquarters is built in place of the dilapidated building. Shyam decides to portray a fake police inspector Ram to enter the building to steal the diamond. He attracts the attention of ACP Ranvir Singh (Paresh Rawal) for his heroism and Inspector Pandey (Om Puri), an inspector who frequently suspects Ram of his true identity. Ram even manages to romance Inspector Ranjita (Bipasha Basu). In the midst of all this, Shyam tries his best to locate the diamond but is forced to enact as a cop to subdue criminals, such as Kalia Anthony (Razzak Khan) and his own friend Johnny. Before Johnny is arrested, Johnny calls Ram as Shyam which causes Pandey to become suspicious of Inspector Ram.

Ram later reveals that Shyam is actually his "twin" brother who is a rascal. Ranvir Singh makes it his job to reform Shyam, so Shyam is forced to balance both Inspector Ram and Shyam (who is employed as the driver of Ranvir) and he even manages to romance Ranvir's daughter Kajal (Shilpa Shetty). Shyam's other friend Guru (Shekhar Suman) is forced to enact as Shyam/Ram's mother as Pandey keeps on suspecting Shyam/Ram while Ranvir seems oblivious to what is happening. Meanwhile Titu and Tony come to know of Shyam's release and they come to know that the diamond is hidden somewhere inside the police headquarters. Posing as tea-boys, they threaten Shyam but Shyam retaliates and attacks causing them to retreat. Shyam and his other cronies devise a plan to convince Ranvir that doppelgangers (twins) exist, so they refer Ranvir as Raghu, who is a wanted drug smuggler.

Kajal, however, is the only one who finds out the real truth about Shyam/Ram. Then Ranvir finds out and gets enraged. Unaware, Tito and Tony find the actual doppelganger of Ranvir, Raghu Swami (also Paresh Rawal). And they threaten to make him pose as Ranvir so that it makes it easier to steal the diamond. Shyam finds out about this and thwarts Tito and Tony's plans. Shyam escapes with the diamond and ends up in a car retailer shop with both Tito and Tony following him. A fight ensues, however, the cops arrive to arrest Shyam, Tito, and Tony. Johnny then appears and presumably shoots Shyam and in turn Shyam shoots Johnny. Both presumably die. Tito and Tony are arrested while the ever-suspicious Pandey finds out that the gun was fake, which meant that Johnny and Shyam did not really kill each other.

At the airport, Pandey and Ranvir bid farewell to Kajal who is going to London. Pandey and Ranvir are then confronted by three Sikhs, who are actually Guru, Shyam and Johnny in disguise (this also confirms that Johnny and Shyam are still alive). Pandey once again suspects them to be Shyam and refuses to believe that twins exist, but the tables turn when Pandey meets his own doppelganger, a Punjabi tourist, for a short while. The film ends with Shyam (disguised as a Sikh) who gifts Kajal a diamond ring which reveals that Kajal was going to get married to Shyam in London.

Guru (1997 film)

Guru () is a 1997 Indian Malayalam-language fantasy drama film directed by Rajiv Anchal and written by C. G. Rajendra Babu from a story by Anchal. Mohanlal plays the lead role, while Suresh Gopi, Madhupal, Sithara, Kaveri, Sreelakshmi, Nedumudi Venu and Sreenivasan appears in supporting roles, and Nassar in a cameo appearance.

The original musical score and songs were composed by Ilaiyaraaja. His symphonic score was conducted and performed by the Budapest Symphony Orchestra, Hungary. This was the first time in Indian cinema, the background score of a film was recorded completely outside the country. "Guru" was selected as India's official entry to the Oscars for the Best Foreign Language Film category. "Guru" was the first Malayalam film submitted by India for the Oscars.

Raghuraman (Mohanlal) is the son of a local Hindu temple's priest in an idyllic village. The people, Hindus and Muslims, live in harmony. When an ambitious politician's (NF Varghese) goons, disguised as Muslims, cause trouble at the local temple, tensions breaks out between the two communities leading to widespread religious riots. Raghurāman, after his family is killed, joins a Hindu extremist gang to take revenge by attacking a group of Muslims who have taken refuge in a Guru's Ashram (a place where a holy Guru lived and worked). After infiltrating the Ashram, he meets Vaidehi who suggests him to meditate for a few moments. During meditation, he experiences an altered state of consciousness and perceives being transported into another world.

In this new world, everyone is blind . They believe the sense of sight to be a lie and that is blasphemous to even talk about it. Children are taught from a very young age that sight does not exist. Raghurāman befriends Ramanagan, a man he saves from death. Raghurāman tries to tell them that there is a world of sight and that he can see, but they refuse to believe him and warn him that such talk will get him killed by the king and the elders.

Living with the man, he learns of their daily life and culture. He notices that they have built a world where sight is not required for anything. He observes when a baby is born in the valley, the juice of a special fruit is given to the infant by the midwives immediately. Ramanagan informs Raghuraman this is the fruit of the sacred tree which was given to them by a goddess when the infants of the valley started to die upon being born. Intrigued by this Raghuraman climbs the tree eats the tasty and highly addictive fruit which is called Ilama pazham (Ilama fruit) by the valley people, the seeds of which are extremely poisonous, which is a common delicacy among them. After eating it, he turns blind and helpless. He is captured by the king’s soldiers and is ordered to be executed by forcing him to eat the seeds of Ilama pazham, a very rare and cruel punishment.

After the soldiers follow the orders, he is left to die and is surprised when he wakes up hours later having gotten his sight back. He uses his newfound knowledge to spread the truth about their blindness and the cure. He convinces Ramanagan and family to trust him and eat the seeds and they too gain their eyesight. The news spreads like wildfire and more and more people begin to eat the seeds and follow Raghuraman.

When the king and advisers learn of this, they arrest Raghuraman. The people respond by starting a rebellion. They storm the palace with weapons where Raghuraman begs them not to use violence and that it achieves nothing. At the same time, in the real world, Raghuraman drops his weapon and wakes up. The extremist group begins their assault on the refugees in the Ashram but Raghuraman rushes to save them, irrespective of their religion.

Rajiv Anchal cite his influence for the film to H. G. Wells's short story "The Country of the Blind", which tells the story of a man who finds himself in a valley of blind men. Anchal first read the book during his college education. He was awestruck by its story and the description of the valley of the blind. He used the Wellsian theme in the film to picturise the human condition, that of "darkness overpowering the soul". Anchal is a disciple of the spiritual leader Karunakara Guru, founder of Santhigiri Ashram in Pothencode, Thiruvananthapuram. The idea for the film came when he met Guru seven years ago (since the release). The film is based on the Guru and tells the message Guru strive to convey to the materialistic world. The fund for the film was raised by 60 of the disciples in the Santhigiri Ashram, including Anchal. The film was made on a production cost of 30 million.

The film's soundtrack contains six songs, all composed by Ilaiyaraaja and lyrics by S. Ramesan Nair. The orchestration for the film's original songs and background score were composed and conducted by Ilaiyaraaja, and performed by the Budapest Symphony Orchestra, Hungary.

"Guru" was selected as India's official entry to the Oscars for the Best Foreign Language Film category for the 70th Academy Awards. "Guru" was the first Malayalam film submitted by India for the Oscars.

But that son, Mahendra, was one of the first to see Binodini's photo when she was proposed as a prospective wife for him, yet refused her on account of his being "unready for marriage." When Binodini arrives with her aunt, Mahendra and his new bride are constantly sneaking off to be alone together. This infatuation does not last long, however, and Mahendra soon begins to see that Binodini is more his type. Mahendra and Binodini, start an affair, and this is soon revealed to Ashalata, who, unaware of her pregnancy, leaves for Kashi. Binodini, after realizing that Mahendra is self-obsessed, leaves Mahendra's house. She pleads with Behari to marry her, but Behari, true to his values, rejects her offer. Binodini leaves the town for her village. She writes a letter to Behari that she'll be waiting for him in Kashi. As she is leaving for Kashi, Mahendra comes to mend their relations, which she refuses. Instead she makes him promise to take her to Behari. At Kashi, Binodini meets Behari who, after some incidents, agrees to marry her. On the day of marriage Binodini vanishes, leaving a letter for Asha. The story details the lives of these three and Mahendra's best friend as they deal with issues such as distrust, adultery, lies, and falling-out. 

The film's background score is by Debojyoti Mishra and, notably, it contains no playback singing. Sreela Majumdar dubbed for Aishwarya Rai and "Sudipta Chakraborty" dubbed for Raima Sen.

In olden days in Bengal, women and girls who were best friends would often set a common nickname for themselves and address each other by that name. In this story, two friends Binodini and Ashalata call each other 'Chokher Bali.'


Aishwarya has given one of her finest performances and one of the best in cinema.

Ekanshu Khera of Planet Bollywood gave the film an 8/10. He found the cinematography to be beautiful and was pleased that the singing was not lip synched. However, he said that the "dubbing leaves much to be desired" and would have preferred a different director dub it in Hindi. He also noted that the film appeals "to a niche audience due to its periodic settings and ideologies." Margaret Pomeranz of ABC Australia gave it 3 out of 5 stars, saying that "the insight it gives into Indian culture and customs, is interesting and that tends to overcome the slight impatience with the overload of emotions." David Stratton, also of ABC, gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting on how the film version was edited 40 minutes shorter but that it was beautifully acted and fascinating.

The film was declared a hit at the box office.

Joymoti (1935 film)

Joymoti or "Joimoti" (), released on 10 March 1935, was the first Assamese film made. Based on Lakshminath Bezbaroa's play about the 17th-century Ahom princess Soti Joymoti, the film was produced and directed by the noted Assamese poet, author, and film-maker Jyoti Prasad Agarwala, and starred Aideu Handique and acclaimed stage actor and playwright Phani Sarma. The film, shot between 1933 and 1935, was released by Chitralekha Movietone in 1935 and marked the beginning of Assamese cinema.

"Joymoti" was screened at the 50th International Conference of the Society For Cinema and Media Studies (SCMC) of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, United States in March 2011.

Other screenings include:
Although never a commercial success, "Joymoti" was noted for its political views and the use of a female protagonist, something almost unheard of in Indian cinema of the time.

The film was the first Indian talkie to have used Dubbing and Re-recording Technology, and the first to engage with "realism" and politics in Indian cinema. The original print containing entire length of the film was thought to be lost after India's division in 1947. However, in 1995, popular Assamese story-writer, novelist, engineer, actor, screenwriter and documentary film director Arnab Jan Deka managed to recover entire footage of the lost film at a Studio in Bombay in intact condition, and reported back the matter to Assam Government apart from writing about this recovery in Assamese daily "Dainik Asam" and English daily "The Assam Express". Afterwards, when other prominent English and Hindi dailies like "The North East Times", "The News Star" and "Purvanchal Prahari" publicly acknowledged the selfless public service of Arnab Jan Deka, the original film's director Jyotiprasad's younger brother Hridayananda Agarwala and famous Assamese actor Satya Prasad Barua also confirmed and publicly acknowledged Arnab Jan Deka's great recovery of the first original full-length print of this historic pioneer film through two separate write-ups in "Dainik Asam" and highly circulated English daily "The Assam Tribune" respectively in 1996. This matter was also debated at Assam Legislative Assembly, and Secretary, Cultural Affairs Department of Assam Government, convened an official meet to discuss this matter together with other issues pertaining to development of Assamese films. Meanwhile, some reels of another remaining print of the film maintained by Hridayananda Agarwala has been restored in part by Altaf Mazid.

Set in 17th-century Assam, the film recounts the sacrifice of Joymoti, an Ahom princess tortured and killed by the Ahom king Borphukan for refusing to betray her husband Gadapani by disclosing his whereabouts. The event is interpreted in contemporary patriotic terms, and calls for a greater harmony between the people of the hills and those of the plains. The hills are represented by the leader Dalimi, a Naga tribeswoman who shelters the fugitive Prince Gadapani.

On his way back from England, Jyoti Prasad Agarwala spent about six months at the UFA Studios in Berlin, learning film-making. Once back in Assam, he decided to make his first film. He established Chitraban Studios at the Bholaguri Tea Estate. Two camps were established: one near the Manager's Bungalow for the female artists, and the other near the tea factory for the male artists. Tea was manufactured by day, and by night actors performed at their rehearsals. Members of the cast were encouraged to keep up their physical exercises to stay fit.

A special property room was constructed, in which Jyoti Prasad Agarwala collected traditional costumes, ornaments, props, hats, etc. This grew into a museum. Technicians were brought in from Lahore; ice, transported from Calcutta.

The film was taken to Lahore for editing, at which stage Agarwala discovered there was no sound for one half of the film. Unable to marshal the actors once again from their native places due to various constraints, he hired a sound studio and dubbed the voices of all male and female characters. On a single day, he recorded six thousand feet of film. This unplanned accomplishment made Jyotiprasad Agarwala the first Indian filmmaker to have introduced Dubbing and Re-recording Technology in Talkies.

Joymoti was the wife of the Ahom prince Gadapani. During the Purge of the Princes from 1679 to 1681 under King Sulikphaa (Loraa Roja), instigated by Laluksola Borphukan, Gadapani took flight. Over the next few years, he sought shelter at Sattras (Vaishnav monasteries) and the adjoining hills outside the Ahom kingdom.
Failing to trace Prince Gadapani, Sulikphaa's soldiers brought his wife Joymoti to Jerenga Pathar where, despite brutal and inhuman torture, the princess refused to reveal the whereabouts of her husband. After continuous physical torture over 14 days, Joymoti breathed her last on 13 Choit of 1601 Saka, or 27 March, AD 1680.

Joymoti's self-sacrifice would bear fruit in time: Laluk was murdered in November 1680 by a disgruntled body of household retainers. The ministers, now roused to a sense of patriotism, sent out search parties for Gadapani who, gathering his strength, returned from his exile in the Garo Hills to oust Sulikphaa from the throne. Joymoti had known that her husband alone was capable of ending Sulikphaa-Laluk's reign of terror. For her love and her supreme sacrifice for husband and country, folk accounts refer to her as a "Soti".

The film was released on 10 March 1935, at the Raonak Theatre, and was inaugurated by the Assamese writer Lakshminath Bezbarua. In Guwahati, it was screened at the Kumar Bhaskar Natya Mandir, the only cinema in Assam which then had sound. The film was not well received, consequently suffering a debilitating financial loss. It was able to collect only INR 24,000 from its screenings, less than half its budget of INR 50,000 (at the time), which today amounts to INR 75,00,000.

"Joymoti", a study of the culture and history of Assam, carried with it the bright possibility of a film tradition. The significant similarities with the Russian montage reflect an element of influence. The film is noted for its constantly changing angles, unique sets (built from scratch on a tea plantation, with local materials), and other stylistics tactics employed by the imaginative Jyoti Prasad in this his film debut. By then a published poet and writer, his lyricism is clearly evident in this pioneering film.

The film was shot on a 4267.20 m-length film.

For all indoor shooting, Jyoti Prasad set up a studio at Bholaguri Tea Estate, near Gohpur, which was owned by the Agarwala family. Named Chitraban, the studio was built using local materials such as wood, bamboo, and banana stumps. The set was artistically designed by Jyoti Prasad himself using bamboo mats, japis of different sizes, deer horns, buffalo horns, and Nāga spears. To furnish the royal court of the Ahoms, he used regal utensils such as maihang, hengdang, bhogjara, bata, sariya, and banbata. He imported a Faizi sound-recording system from Lahore, and the first camera into Assam from Mehta of Calcutta.

The unit arrived at Bholaguri Tea Estate in December 1933 to commence filming, and camped in front of the garden factory. Jyoti Prasad arranged all accommodation arrangements personally, and set up a laboratory for developing film by the side of his ‘Chitraban’ studio.

According to Natasurya Phani Sarma, who played a key role in the film, Chitraban was not merely a studio, but a film-training institute in itself. Apart from the acting, Jyoti Prasad also taught his actors certain film-making techniques—such as developing, processing, printing, and editing—and shared with them his knowledge of various film shots like mixed shot, fade out, zoom, dissolve, back projection, and model shooting. The 17th-century costumes used in the film were designed by Jyoti Prasad, and the make-up was done by the actors themselves, assisted by Sonitkowar Gajen Borua. 

Although shooting at the Chitraban Studio started in April 1933, it faced an initial delay as Jyoti Prasad was unable to find a suitable young woman to play "Joymoti", as well as actors for a few other roles. He floated newspaper advertisements for actors and actresses, mentioning brief outlines of the film and descriptions of the characters. His idea was to get ‘types’ for his characters, not seasoned actors, even offering remunerations for successful candidates. One of his preconditions was that potential actors needed to be from ‘respectable’ families, as opposed to red-light areas, as had been the case during the 1930s in Calcutta. This was inspired by Jyoti Prasad's desire to liberate cinema from that "uncertain" reputation. After a prolonged search and detailed interviews, he discovered Aideu Handique in a remote village near Golaghat, for the role of Joymoti: she was to become the first actress of Assamese cinema. He then brought together the other chosen actors, of whom some had never seen a film, to acquaint them with his characters. He sought out a film-making trio, Bhupal Shankar Mehta and the Faizi Brothers from Lahore, as cameraman and sound-recordists.

During filming, the rainy season was to prove a challenge to developments in the technical process, with Jyoti Prasad having to suspend shooting for several days at a time, due to insufficient light in the absence of outdoor electricity. Shooting was carried out under sunlight by using reflectors. When the rain stopped, the banana stumps used to build the splendid Ahom court dried out under the sunlight, yet filming continued - japis ingeniously fastened over the dry patches. Filming was eventually completed in August 1934, and "Joymoti" released in early 1935 after Jyoti Prasad had completed his own editing.


Following the Second World War "Joymoti" was lost and almost forgotten. In the early 1970s, Jyoti Prasad’s youngest brother, Hridayananda Agarwala, found seven reels of the lone print of "Joymoti" while cleaning junk out of his garage. Jyoti Prasad’s venture, with its considerable losses, had cost the family plantation dearly, placing his family in acute difficulties. The condition of the reels, by the early 1970s, was abysmal, but his brother Hridayananda commissioned the well-known Assamese director Bhupen Hazarika to direct the long 1976 documentary "Rupkonwar Jyotiprasad aru Joymoti", in which the reels were incorporated. The documentary thereby saved the reels, which have been copied and remastered since.

Then, in 1995, popular Assamese story-writer, novelist, engineer, actor, screenwriter and documentary film director Arnab Jan Deka, recovered the original intact print of the film, containing the entire footage, at a Studio in Bombay. This original print of "Joymoti" was thought to be lost after India's division in 1947, as it was left behind in a studio in Lahore, now in Pakistan. Somehow the print, together with other films, travelled from Lahore and resurfaced in India's film capital. 

After making this great recovery, Arnab Jan Deka reported the matter to the Assam Government, and wrote about this recovery in the Assamese daily "Dainik Asam" and the English daily "The Assam Express". Other leading English and Hindi newspapers, like "The North East Times", "The News Star", and "Purvanchal Prahari", published extensive reports about Arnab Jan Deka's phenomenal discovery. This film's director Jyotiprasad Agarwala's younger brother, Hridayananda Agarwala, and the famous Assamese actor-playwright, Satya Prasad Barua, also confirmed and publicly acknowledged Arnab Jan Deka's great recovery through two separate articles in the "Dainik Asam" and the highly circulated English daily "The Assam Tribune" in 1996. This matter was also debated at Assam Legislative Assembly, and Secretary, Cultural Affairs Department of Assam Government, convened an official meet to discuss this matter together with other issues pertaining to development of Assamese films.

In 2011 Arnab Jan Deka again wrote in detail about this entire episode in the prestigious Assamese literary journal "Prantik".

Situated about 10 km west of Gohpur, Jyoti Prasad's temporary film studio ‘Chitraban’, at Bholaguri Tea Estate, today stands deserted, a nostalgic nod to its glorious past. Once owned by Jyoti Prasad, the tea plantation passed on to the Assam Tea Corporation in 1978. The garden, where Jyoti Prasad single-handedly laid the foundation stone of Assamese cinema, now lies abandoned. The bungalow, where he composed the music for "Joymoti" on his organ, still stands - albeit in a dilapidated condition.

Indramalati

Indramalati is the second Assamese language film, directed by the great Assamese poet Jyotiprasad Agarwala. It was released in 1939.

Director Jyotiprasad faced a major financial crisis after his first film "Joymoti" (1935) failed commercially. He spent more than Rs 50,000 and was in debt in the late 1930s; he was fortunate to gather together just Rs 15,000 to make his dream of making a second film come true. Desperately seeking to compensate the loss he incurred in the making of "Joymoti", he began shooting "Indramalati" in late 1937. This time, however, he did not use his Chitraban Studio for the outdoor shoot. Instead, he chose the ‘Talbari’ of his family, at Harigaon, two kilometres from Tezpur Mission Chariali. Within seven days, Jyotiprasad completed the outdoor shooting for the picture and often the camera was kept at a fixed point as the sets and artistes kept changing the angles. The film used over 15,000 feet of reel.

On release in 1939 it was relatively successful, earning in excess of "Joymati", aiding Jyotiprasad to go on to direct other films afterwards.

Jyotiprasad Agarwala wrote the story of "Indramalati", which was a tale of romance. The name of the hero was Indrajit while Malati was the name of the heroine. Significantly, Jyotiprasad was the first filmmaker to introduce the style of movie-making of using the names of the lead pair.

The role of the hero was played by Manoviram Baruah while Raseswari Baruah (Hazarika) was cast as Malati. Acclaimed theatre actor Phani Sarma was again drafted in to play one of the significant roles, that of Indrajit’s friend. Even great Assamese musician Dr Bhupen Hazarika acted in the film and sang "Biswa Bijoyee Navajowan" at only age 13. Unlike casting for his first film, Jyotiprasad faced comparatively less trouble in finding actors for "Indramalati".

There were only nine major roles in "Indramalati". Besides Manoviram Barua and Raseswari Baruah, the others were Phani Sarma, Thanuram Bora, Lalit Mohan Choudhury, Khargeswar Agarwalla, Kashi Saikia, Bedananda Sarma and Bhupen Hazarika. Other actors who were in the film included the Rupkonwar himself, Jnanaviram Barua, Mani Lahiri, etc.

After the casting and seven-day outdoor shoot, the eight-member film unit left for Kolkata where they would shoot for the indoor locations. Sets were built in Arora Studio, Narkeldanga, where all the indoor shooting was done. An amazingly short three-day shooting schedule at Arora Studio was followed by the artistes, working hard round the clock.

"Indramalati" was produced once again under the banner of ‘Chitralekha Movietone and was very much a solo effort in that Jyotiprasad Agarwalla was the director, screenwriter, lyricist, music director, art director, costume designer and editor.

No artistes of "Indramalati", like "Joymoti", took remuneration. They even participated in the shooting wearing their own clothes. In some scenes, the costumes fail to maintain continuity.

Vasudevan (Dhanush) is from a middle-class family. He makes several bids to obtain employment, but all goes in vain due to his poor language skills and inadequate education qualifications. All his friends settle in life, but he continues to struggle in finding work. Vasu has two faithful friends named Cheenu (Karthik Kumar) and Ganesh (Karunaas). His father (Raghuvaran), who is a teacher, is always critical of him for being an irresponsible person. This adds to his woes.

At this juncture, Vasu glimpses a woman named Keerthi (Nayanthara) and immediately falls in love with her. He learns that she works for a software solutions firm. Luckily for him, Vasu secures employment in the same firm. Keerthi eventually turns out to be a short-tempered young woman. On a business trip, Vasu accompanies her with two other colleagues (Jeeva and Manobala), to Australia. Here he reveals his feelings of love to her. She immediately turns him down, saying that she comes from an Orthodox family, and her marriage has already been arranged with her uncle's son.

A depressed Vasu returns to India thereafter. Unable to see his son in depression, his father decides to meet Keerthi. She abuses him for recommending his son's love and accidentally slaps Vasu and his father. Later that night, Vasu's father dies of heart attack. To help change Vasu's mood, Cheenu persuades him to come to his family house in the country. Coincidentally, on the train journey, Keerthi is revealed to be Cheenu's fiance. However, their grandfather's (K. Viswanath) thoughts of getting them married earlier are put aside because Cheenu and Keerthi leave the house to have their own identity. This causes heartburn to their grandfather.

With the passing of a few days, Keerthi and Cheenu's parents decide to get them married to appease their grandfather. After several turns of events, Keerthi realizes that she is in love with Vasu instead. Vasu asks her to forget him because he believes that it would create problems in their happy family. Cheenu overhears their midnight conversation. During the wedding, Cheenu tries to force Vasu and Keerthi to confess their relationship to everyone. But when they hesitate to do so, Cheenu stops the marriage himself, by lying to his elders that he has a secret wife in Chennai. When Cheenu comes under fire from his relatives, Vasu tells them the truth and is driven out of the house. He is joined only by the grandma of the house, who agrees to accompany him as she reminds Vasu of his late father.

In time, the rest of Cheenu and Keerthi's family comes to stay with him for a few days. But Cheenu's grandfather refuses to enter the house, telling Vasu he is still angry with him and needs time to change himself somehow. The movie ends when Vasu and Keerthi become a happy couple and live together happily.


The music of "Yaaradi Nee Mohini" was scored by Yuvan Shankar Raja, who had composed the music for the original film as well.

The lyrics were provided by Na. Muthukumar.

The satellite rights of the film were sold to Sun TV.
"Behindwoods" wrote "Yaaradi Nee Moghini is smartly packaged with everything inevitable in a Dhanush movie. With subdued emotions that hardly ever go overboard and in your face humor, director A. Jawahar gets everything right. Well, almost". "Sify" wrote "If you like feel-good love stories mixed with a lot of comedy and sentiments then, Yaaradi Nee Mohini is an ideal treat for the entire family. All credits go to debutant director Jawahar, Selvaraghavan?s long time associate for remaking his guru?s Telugu super-hit Adavari Matalaku Ardhalu Verule into Tamil. It is a well packaged film that will appeal to a broad spectrum of audiences". "Rediff" wrote "The movie is another example of a familiar story making a good watch simply because it's been made differently".
"Yaaradi Nee Mohini" had taken the best ever opening for a Selvaraghavan film. It was the most successful of the year.

Haseena Maan Jaayegi

Haseena Maan Jaayegi () (English: The babe will agree) is a 1999 Indian Hindi-language comedy film directed by David Dhawan. It stars Sanjay Dutt, Govinda, Karisma Kapoor, Pooja Batra, Anupam Kher, Kader Khan, Aruna Irani, and Paresh Rawal. The film is inspired by the 1966 film "Pyar Kiye Jaa" and went on to become the fifth-highest-grossing Hindi film of 1999. It is often regarded as being amongst Govinda's greatest performances and he won many awards for his role as Monu. "Pyar Kiye Ja" itself is a remake of the 1964 Tamil classic film "Kadhalikka Neramillai" which had been remade as the Telugu film "Preminchi Choodu" (1965), the Hindi film "Pyar Kiye Jaa" (1966), and the Kannada film "Preethi Madu Thamashe Nodu" (1979).

Amirchand (Kader Khan) is the ill-fated father of two mischievous sons—Sonu (Sanjay Dutt) and Monu (Govinda). Both of them are always up to one prank or another, most of them aimed at stealing money from Amirchand.

In the opening scene, they call up their father, acting like gangsters, and ask for a huge sum if he wants to live. The plan fails as Amirchand turns out to be the driver of the taxi in which they were escaping. Later, they fix up the marriage of their father
with Shakuntala (Bindu) and take one lakh rupees as advance dowry from her brother Jamnadas (Asrani). This plan also fails as Amirchand refuses to entertain Jamnadas and his sister.

Amirchand warns their sons to become serious towards life if they want to live in his home. He asks Monu to join office and Sonu to go to Goa for claiming some money he had lent to someone. Whereas Monu plays another prank by calling up a girls' hostel and flirting with Ritu (Karisma Kapoor), Sonu mistakenly goes to one Gulzarilal Verma (Anupam Kher) for claiming the money, where he meets Pooja (Pooja Batra). Both Ritu and Pooja are Gulzarilal's daughters.

Sonu and Monu fall in love with Pooja and Ritu, respectively. Sonu calls up Monu to come to Goa, disguised as his Uncle for fixing up his and Pooja's marriage. This leads to a series of confusions as Gulzarilal's sister Santho (Aruna Irani) also falls in love with Monu (disguised as Uncle).

To get rid of the problem, Sonu and Monu throw a dummy of the Uncle from top of a cliff, only to land up getting arrested for killing the non-existent uncle. Amirchand comes to know of this and reaches Goa with his assistant Kunj Biharilal (Satish Kaushik). As they, along with Gulzarilal are on their way to police station, they are kidnapped by a Bhai (Ashish Vidyarthi). Sonu and Monu escape from the lockup with Bhootnath's (Paresh Rawal) help and rescue their father and to-be father-in-law, thus proving to be worthy sons.

Kyo Kii... Main Jhuth Nahin Bolta

Kyo Kii... Main Jhuth Nahin Bolta () is a 2001 Indian Hindi-language fantasy comedy film directed by David Dhawan, starring Govinda, Sushmita Sen, Rambha, Anupam Kher, Satish Kaushik, Mohnish Bahl and Ashish Vidyarthi. It is inspired by the Hollywood film "Liar Liar" (1997), starring Jim Carrey. The movie shares certain elements with "Liar Liar", such as Govinda being a compulsive liar like Carrey's character and his son wishing that his dad would stop lying. The movie is also inspired by superhit Marathi movie "Dhangad Dhinga" starring Mahesh Kothare and Laxmikant Berde. Some plot is inspired from Rakesh Roshan's "Kaamchor".

Coming from small-town Hoshiarpur to big city Bombay, conman and compulsive liar, Raj Malhotra (Govinda), a lawyer by profession, sets up shop with fellow lawyer, Mohan. He falls in love with Sonam (Sushmita Sen), daughter of a wealthy lawyer Tejpal. He devises a scheme to marry into this wealthy family, and he succeeds. Years later, he has a son, who wishes that his dad would stop lying; and a mistress, Tara. The son's wish comes true, and all utterances from Raj's mouth are truthful. This creates a crisis in his personal life, as he confesses about his mistress; as well as his professional life, when he starts telling the truth in court, especially with his underworld clients, who are now out to kill him.


The music has been composed by Anand Raj Anand. Akhlaq Hussain of Planet Bollywood rated the album 7 out of 10.

Yeh Teraa Ghar Yeh Meraa Ghar

Yeh Teraa Ghar Yeh Meraa Ghar (; English: "This is your house, this is my house") is a 2001 Indian film directed by Priyadarshan. This story of the film is an adaptation of the Mohanlal-starrer movie "Sanmanassullavarkku Samadhanam". The film stars Sunil Shetty, Mahima Chaudhry and Paresh Rawal.

After the death of his dad, Dayashankar Manorilal Pandey (Sunil Shetty) arranges the marriage of his two sisters. In debt, he goes to the city to ask the tenants to leave his house, as he intends to sell it and repay his debts. A Maharashtrian woman, her two daughters, Jyoti, Saraswati (Mahima Chaudhry), and one son, Chotu (Master Aditi) are living there. When Dayashankar asks them to vacate, they refuse. What results is Dayashankar's hilarious attempts to force them to vacate - from seeking legal advice; filing police reports; asking goons to remove them - moving in himself. Will Dayashankar succeed in his attempts to evict his tenants?


Two songs gained immense popularity; "Saraswati" (Sonu Nigam) and "Hasate Ho" (Abhijeet, Alka Yagnik).

Pop artist Adnan Sami made his debut into Bollywood with the title song. However, "Mehbooba" from "Ajnabee" released first.

The song "Govinda" was recorded by a dubbing artist and later recorded by Alka Yagnik. For reasons unknown, the first few lines of the song are retained with the original uncredited singer's vocals.

Subarnarekha (film)

Subarnarekha ( "Subarṇarekhā") is an Indian Bengali film directed by Ritwik Ghatak. It was produced in 1962 but not released until 1965. It is a part of the trilogy, "Meghe Dhaka Tara" (1960), "Komal Gandhar" (1961), and "Subarnarekha" (1962), all dealing with the aftermath of the Partition of India in 1947 and the refugees coping with it.

The film tells the story of Ishwar Chakraborty (Abhi Bhattacharya), a Hindu refugee from East Pakistan after the 1947 partition of India. He goes to West Bengal with his little sister Sita (Indrani Chakrabarty) where he tries to start a new life. In a refugee camp, they see the abduction of a low-caste woman and Ishwar takes her little son Abhiram (Sriman Tarun) with him. He gets a job at a factory in the province, near the river Subarnarekha, courtsey his college friend Rambilas (Pitambar). Ishwar, Sita and Abhiram arrive at Chatimpur, a small settlement near Ghatshila where they meet Mukherjee (Jahor Roy), foreman of the foundry workshop, who greets them with love. 

Abhiram is sent to Jhargram for education shortly after and Sita becomes lonely. Abhiram completes his study successfully and comes back on the very day Ishwar was appointed as the new manager. Abhiram finds that Ishwar had already arranged for his application in a German University to pursue his career further in engineering, but to his foster-brother's surprise, he refuses and decides to become a writer instead. Soon after, he (Satindra Bhattacharya) and Sita (Madhabi Mukherjee) discover that they are in love. But at this moment, Ishwar's fear of prejudice emerges, as he does not want his sister, a Brahmin, to marry a lower caste boy. At the same time, Abhiram's caste gets exposed to the others also when he recognizes his dying mother at rail station in front of many people. Ishwar senses danger and asks him to leave for Calcutta when he gives proposal to marry Sita. During Sita's wedding with another man, the girl and Abhiram elope and go to Calcutta. Ishwar is angry and heartbroken.

Sita and Abhiram live in the slums of Calcutta and try to make ends meet. They have a little son (Sriman Ashok Bhattacharya). One day, Abhiram gets a new job as a bus driver, but this leads to tragedy: when he accidentally hits and kills a little girl, he is lynched by the crowd. In her desperate situation, Sita is forced to think about taking up prostitution.

In the meantime, Ishwar is living a lonely and sad life in the province. When his old time friend Haraprasad (Bijon Bhattacharya) comes to visit him, they decide to go to Calcutta on a binge drinking tour. They finally end up in a brothel, both completely drunk. When Ishwar staggers into one of the bedchambers, he is faced... with his own sister, whose first "client" he should become. Sita immediately recognizes him and cuts her own throat rather than have her brother see how far she has fallen. She dies. When Ishwar realizes what has happened, he breaks down.

At the end of the film, the now completely broken Ishwar meets Sita's little son, who is now his closest relative. Ishwar and Binu arrives at Ghatshila rail station. Just as the train leaves, Ishwar receives a letter from foreman Mukherjee from which he comes to know that he has been sacked from his managerial job because of his truthful ideology and all the legal matter he faced after her sister committed suicide. Mukherjee is now the new manager and he asks Ishwar to vacate the quarter. Ishwar, at first, feels lost but as he sees little Binu, he brightens up and decides to take the little boy into his clutches. The film ends with the two approaching the quarter along the banks of Subarnarekha, with Binu, not knowing the reality fills with joy to see his new home, the story he has been told by his mother many times, while Ishwar pants but still does not reveal the truth in order not to spoil his little nephew's dream.



The film's soundtrack consists of the following songs composed by Ustad Bahadur Khan:


In a critics' poll of all-time greatest films conducted by Asian film magazine "Cinemaya" in 1998, "Subarnarekha" was ranked at #11 on the list. Critic Girish Shambu, director Ashim Ahluwalia and 2 others included the film on their respective lists of "The Greatest Films of All Time" (polled by "Sight & Sound"), making it the 322nd best film according to the Directors' poll. Ahluwalia considers it to be "one of the most intuitive, messy and haunting films ever made with the best drunk taxi ride in the history of cinema."

Arth () is a 1982 Indian drama film directed by Mahesh Bhatt, starring Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Shabana Azmi, Smita Patil, Raj Kiran and Rohini Hattangadi. It features a memorable soundtrack by Ghazal duo, Jagjit Singh and Chitra Singh.

The semi-autobiographical film was written by Mahesh Bhatt about his extramarital relationship with Parveen Babi. It is one of the 25 Must See Bollywood Movies as compiled by Indiatimes Movies. The film was remade in Tamil as "Marupadiyum" (1993) by Balu Mahendra. In 2017, Pakistani actor and director Shaan Shahid released a sequel, "Arth 2" and Bhatt acted as a "mentor" during production.

Pooja (Shabana Azmi), who grew up as an orphan girl and always dreamt of owning a house, becomes insecure when she finds out that she and her husband, Inder (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), have to leave the apartment they rent. The twist that occurred when Inder gives her the keys of a new house proves to be double-edged, when it is revealed that he is in love with another woman, Kavita (Smita Patil), with whom he earned the money (in the film industry) for the new apartment. While previously giving advice to her maid (Rohini Hattangadi) cheated by her husband, now Pooja becomes herself involved in a similar situation. When Inder deserts Pooja for Kavita, she chooses to leave the apartment for a women's hostel with only 2000 that she had when she got married. She is helped by Raj (Raj Kiran) to surpass the difficulties of life as a single person, to find a job and to rely morally on herself. Raj and Pooja become good friends. Gradually, Kavita's mental instability deepens her fears of insecurity, even after Inder requests Pooja to sign the divorce papers.

Raj falls in love with Pooja and proposes to her. She refuses saying she is empty and cannot give him anything. Raj tries to persuade her saying that she cannot spend the rest of her life feeling miserable about the past and that she should try to find a new life for herself. Pooja promises to think about it.

Pooja's maid, whose only aim in life is to secure a good education for her daughter, has saved 1000 towards her admission fees. She finds out that her drunk husband has stolen the money. Furious, she searches for him to find him in the arms of his lover after spending all the money. She kills him and goes to the police station and confesses her crime. Worried about her daughter, she calls Pooja who promises to take care of the daughter.

After the insistence of Kavita's mother (Dina Pathak) and her personal doctor (Om Shivpuri), Pooja personally assures Kavita that she is not interested in Inder any more. However, Pooja's attitude only convinces Kavita that breaking Pooja's marriage was a mistake. To escape from her feeling of guilt and insecurity, she breaks-up with Inder. The latter tries to revive his relation with Pooja, but is rejected.

Pooja continues to live with her maid's daughter and refuses to marry Raj saying that she has found a new meaning to life in being independent and being a mother to the child and marrying Raj will only weaken her.



The film was made on a budget of 1 crore and grossed 2 crore at the Box-office and was declared as "Hit" by the Box-office.

Afterwards, the auto driver returns home to his wife (Pragathi) and son Charan. Unfortunately, Mattu Bhai and his henchmen break into their house that night. The auto driver is killed, his wife is severely injured, and Charan survives uninjured. Charan's mother is in a critical condition, but Charan and his uncle (Tanikella Bharani) do not have enough money to pay for her operation. The local mafia leader's son has committed murder and offers Charan a deal. In order to pay for his mother's surgery, Charan has to go to prison accepting the crime.

12 years later, Charan (Ram Charan) is released from prison. When he meets his uncle again, he finds out that his mother has died. Charan also falls in love with Sanjana (Neha Sharma). Sanjana lives with her father Karthikeya (Prakash Raj), a rich business magnate. Police Officer Ajay (Sayaji Shinde) helps Charan get a passport. Charan plans to go to Bangkok to join a travel agency recommended by his uncle. Sanjana and her friends arrive in Bangkok as tourists. Charan is one of the tour guides but seems to be irritable around Sanjana. Meanwhile, Biku (Daniel Balaji) and his henchmen bother Sanjana. Charan saves Sanjana by attacking them. A few days later, Biku and his henchmen see Sanjana again, and Charan has to fight them again. Charan and Sanjana use a water bike to escape. They get stuck in the middle of the sea when their water bike runs out of gas. When Sanjana wakes up, she sees an island that is a little far away, meaning that she and Charan have to swim to the island. Later, Charan tells Sanjana that he loves her.

Karthikeya and the other people believe that Sanjana is kidnapped by Charan as they find out that Charan was in prison for 12 years. Karthikeya arranges helicopters to search for Sanjana. Charan sees a helicopter in the sky, but Sanjana does not want anyone to find them. Sanjana tells Charan that she loves him too and her father would never let her marry him. Charan loves Sanjana but did not expect her to fall in love with him. He reveals that he came to Bangkok to kill Mattu Bhai. Charan found out that Mattu Bhai is a notorious international criminal with network in Hong Kong, Bangkok, and other places. He has shifted base to Bangkok. Charan tells Sanjana that Biku is none other than Mattu Bhai's son. In Bangkok, Charan tried to kill Mattu Bhai at a bar, but Mattu Bhai escaped and stopped coming to Bangkok.

By the time Charan finishes telling his foiled plot to kill Mattu Bhai, a lot of guys in black robes and black suits come, and then a fight starts. Just then, Karthikeya comes in a helicopter. Sanjana, seeing her father, runs to him and tells him not to hit Charan as he did not kidnap her but instead saved her. At first, Karthikeya tells to leave Charan, and the goons leave him, but when Sanjana tells him that she wants and loves Charan, Karthikeya tells the goons to kill Charan. The goons hit Charan on the head, he falls down, and they go away. Then, a member of the company for which Charan works searches for him on a boat, finds him, and takes him back. A hot argument takes place between Sanjana and her father, and she runs away to Charan.

Then, Karthikeya calls Charan and tells him that his mother is still alive. His uncle lied to Charan that his mother died. Karthikeya will trade Charan's mother for Sanjana. Charan takes Sanjana to a building, where he tells her that he is going to trade her for his mother. He tells her that she has her father, but his mother has no one except him. Karthikeya comes and takes her, and gives Charan his mother, who was grateful to him, back.

Meanwhile, Mattu Bhai sees the pictures of Charan and Sanjana on television, which was the effort of Karthikeya to find her, and recognizes Charan as the person who tried to kill him. He tells Biku to kidnap Sanjana, and Biku does the same when the exchange of Sanjana and Charan's mother goes. In the process, gunfire takes place, where all of Karthikeya's men get shot. Charan also retaliates with a gun and kills some of Biku's men, but Biku gets away with Sanjana. Karthikeya gets shot in the leg, and in emotion, tells Charan that he saw how much he loves his mother and screams that someone is taking away his fiancée away, so he reminds him to go and get her. Charan leaves his mother in Karthikeya's care. He then runs after Biku's car but fails to get him. One of Biku's men gets to him and gives him a phone, where he talks with Mattu Bhai. The goons take Charan with his hands tied to the island where Mattu Bhai and Biku are.

Mattu Bhai, without killing Charan and Sanjana as suggested by his son, lets them escape saying he would hunt them, but Charan kills all the men of Mattu Bhai and finally kills Biku. Using his body, Charan lures Mattu Bhai into his trap and then kills him, in the same way that Mattu Bhai killed Charan's father. This is when Mattu Bhai recognizes who Charan is.

Tere Mere Sapne (1996 film)

Tere Mere Sapne ("Our Dreams") is a 1996 Hindi romantic drama film produced by Amitabh Bachchan's production company A.B.C.L. and directed by Joy Augustine. The film had a cast of newcomer actors consisting of Chandrachur Singh, Arshad Warsi, Priya Gill and Simran.

The plot of the movie is broadly similar to Twain's "The Prince and the Pauper". Two boys are born on the same day. One is Rahul Mehta (Chandrachur Singh), born with a silver spoon in his mouth to a rich family in England; another is Baalu (Arshad Warsi), born in a middle-class Brahmin family somewhere in Mumbai. Both grow up until they are destined to exchange places on their 22nd birthday.

Rahul's parents died when he was young, and he lives with his grandfather Shambunath Mehta (Pran). He wants to visit India to see his parents' graves though his grandfather doesn't want him to go. He is afraid Rahul may fall in love and ruin himself as his parents did. With much persuasion, he comes to India and manages to escape his guardians, Ram Singh (Bal Dhuri) and detective Mirchandani (Manoj Pahwa), at the airport and catches a taxi.

The driver of the taxi is none other than Baalu who, not knowing Rahul's true identity, keeps cursing the rich guy for being born on the same day as him and enjoying the wealthy life. Later, Rahul discloses his identity and Baalu feels ashamed, but both become good friends.

Rahul does not want to go back to his wealth-ridden world, so he asks Baalu to take his place and let him take Baalu's place. So Rahul becomes the taxi driver and informs Ram Singh that someone will be coming to them in his place. Baalu reaches the hotel, and Ram Singh has a tough time grooming Baalu to behave like a rich guy.

Rahul goes to Baalu's place where he finds Baalu's sister Paro (Priya Gill) and falls in love with her. Baalu, while attending a meeting with one V.P. Mathur (Suresh Malhotra), who is the caretaker of Mehta Industries in India, meets Mathur's daughter Pooja (Simran) and falls in love with her.

Mehta industries are in shambles because of corrupt managers. The union leader Dattabhau (A.K. Hangal) explains this to Baalu (disguised as Rahul). Baalu takes care of this and reopens the company, declaring equal profit sharing among labourers.

At the Shastri's place, Paro's father P.V. Shastri (K.D. Chandran) comes to know of Rahul and Paro's love affair and is enraged since Rahul is a Christian. Baalu comes into the picture and pacifies the situation. Rahul decides to turn into a Brahmin so that he can marry Paro.

Rahul's grandfather in England learns what is happening with Rahul and comes to India to control the situation. However, since the control of Mehta Industries has gone out of the Mathurs' hands, they decide to kill Rahul and Shambhunath. Rahul and Baalu fight to save Shambhuath from the gangster hired by the Mathurs to kill him.


The music was composed by Viju Shah, with lyrics by Anand Bakshi. The soundtrack album, released by Simmba T-Series, sold 2.2million units in India, making it the sixth best-selling Bollywood soundtrack of 1996.

The film, upon release, gained highly positive reviews not only for its script but also for its performances and music. Though made on a modest budget and with newcomers, the film raked well at the box office and was declared a 'HIT'.

Let's Talk (2002 film)

Let's Talk is an Indian English language film, released on 13 December 2002. It is produced by Shift Focus and directed by Ram Madhvani. It is the first ever Indian feature film that was shot in the digital format. It was then reverse printed in 35mm film (reverse telecine) to be released in cinemas.

Radhika (Maia Katrak) has been married for over ten years to Nikhil (Boman Irani) and is having an affair for the past six months with an interior designer, Krish. Radhika is now pregnant with Krish's child and pours out her plight to a friend, Rita (Anahita Oberoi). She mentions a particular incident where she suffered a miscarriage of their second child that had started the rift. Radhika says that she did not want to have this baby, while Nikhil did, and adds that both of them have not quite gotten over the miscarriage. Radhika wants to come clean with Nikhil, while Rita advises her to sort things out in her mind first as to what she wants before she tells Nikhil. Radhika then plays out various scenes in her mind where she has told Nikhil of her affair and visualizes different ways in which Nikhil could react.

The first scenario has Nikhil lying on the couch while Radhika has confessed all and is helplessly asking him for advice as to what she should do now since she doesn't have a clue. Nikhil is silent for the most part but lashes out at her when she mentions their daughter, Sakshi. Nikhil walks to the kitchen to make himself a cup of coffee and relates to Radhika for the first time, what he had to go through when she suffered the miscarriage. Nikhil then breaks down, saying that he came home on a day quite as ordinary as other days to find his wife was pregnant and the baby was not his. He seems fixated on the last part, and keeps re-iterating it. Radhika tries to reach out to him but he brushes her away. He slowly walks out of the kitchen, into the hall and then the balcony, as Radhika follows and realizes he has taken a jump from their high rise apartment.

The next scenario has Radhika and Nikhil on their dining table, Nikhil is singing at the top of his voice, much to Radhika's consternation, while he repeatedly refuses to believe Radhika's confession, attributing it to the fact that Radhika is just a typical bored urban Indian wife and is making the whole story up for laughs. Nikhil pokes fun at the situation saying "Krish and Radha" are so perfect for each other, all the while nonchalantly pounding away on his laptop.

Radhika retains her focus on the dining table again, where a supper time scenario is played out this time. As they sit down to eat, Nikhil starts off asking Radhika the cryptic question "Where do you go?", and persisting with his interrogation of a sullen Radhika until exasperated, she asks him what exactly he means by that. Nikhil elaborates asking her where they go to screw. As Radhika replies they go to the new flat, Nikhil continues making crude remarks until Radhika asks him why he is doing it. Nikhil responds by banging a quarter plate on the table to make Radhika jump up and points out that that isn't the way he is reacting, by screaming, pulling his hair out, or by throwing things around, and ventures Radhika to guess why he isn't acting that way. When Radhika does ask him why, he says that he is able to maintain his cool due to the Indian Penal Code section 497 where Radhika is his private property and anyone trespassing could go to jail. Radhika disbelievingly says he wouldn't do that, but Nikhil holds his stand.

Nikhil proposes to talk to Radhika just as a friend in the next scenario played out in Radhika's mind, where he asks her if she has thought about the future and what she wants to do. He suggests calling Krish over since he wants to ask him a few questions. Radhika thinks this is futile and asks him what he would ask Krish. Nikhil starts off by asking an imaginary Krish seated in their apartment if he loved Radhika, to which Krish responds in the affirmative. Nikhil then asks Radhika if she and Krish have thought about their future, and is quite incredulous when she says that they haven't discussed anything like that in the six months that the affair has been going on. Nikhil then poses another question to Krish asking him if he would marry Radhika. On Krish's slight hesitation to answer this question, Nikhil totally dismisses him telling Radhika that that isn't the way he is supposed to respond, but is to say, "Of course, but I need some time". Nikhil then points out to Radhika that Krish has walked out of the door and explains to her that he is just looking out for her since he is concerned. 
Nikhil takes on a jealous, egoistic stand in the next imagery depicted, hitting Radhika with the fact that she might have had an affair for 6 months, while he has been having one with her sister Anita for the past five years. Radhika disregards his claims saying that he is acting juvenile, and making this up just for revenge. A discussion of how good Nikhil is in bed ensues, where Radhika compares him to Krish, saying that he has reduced her to a pair of breasts and one other part in bed, without a face, without arms, without a neck. She relates how Krish has opened up a whole new world to her by concentrating and spending hours on her neck, which she never knew was so sensitive. Nikhil asks her to swear on Sakshi that Krish is better than him in bed, and when she refuses to do so, hangs on to some words of hers uttered in another context, and uses them to massage his ego, interpreting the same to his own self that he is better in bed.

The next visualization has Nikhil drunk and sorting out CDs in the bedroom, as he calls out to Radhika to join him. Nikhil then starts off asking Radhika if she knows what "Supari" is. When she responds saying it is money given to get rid of someone, Nikhil starts playing out a mock situation where he gives supari to get Krish maimed. He enacts a complete scene where the goons castrate Krish and place his genitals in a glass jar, in this case, the glass of champagne Nikhil is drinking acts as the prop and Nikhil directly takes a sip out of it after he has finished his little act. Radhika is visibly disgusted and walks out of the bedroom.

A cut back to reality shows Radhika still confused and blaming her friend Rita for not helping her out. Rita then propounds her thesis with a plate of biscuits and a knife. There's Radhika and the unborn baby, Sakshi, Nikhil and Krish, all represented by the biscuits. Rita moves the biscuits around the plate showing her the various permutations and combinations, and finally narrows it down to a straight choice between Krish and Nikhil, alternating the knife in quick motions on the two biscuits that represent them. Finally, Rita asks Radhika to eat up, and the two women now spontaneously break out into laughter at the situation Radhika is so tightly meshed up in.

Radhika's mind gets a bit intense with her imagining a scene next of returning home amidst sightings of Krishna in the city, and packing a few things of their daughter Sakshi into a brown box, while Nikhil has just returned from office. Radhika begins to silently weep and when Nikhil inquires as to why, she talks about seeing a girl on the roadside, about fourteen years old, and just 5 or 6 years older than Sakshi, breastfeeding a baby. While Nikhil is puzzling over why this would affect Radhika so much she blurts out that she is pregnant. Nikhil's confusion turns to elation and further puzzlement when Radhika does not share his happiness. Radhika tells him about how she did not want to go through what happened five years ago when she had the miscarriage at which Nikhil really loses it, and calls her stupid since she doesn't know what is good for her or will make her happy. The very next instant Radhika is lying on the floor, bruised badly, in her own vomit, her pants pulled down over her knees, while around broken glass strewn around show the evidence of a rape and struggle. Nikhil emerges from the balcony hearing the phone ring, and bathes the cuts on his face with astringent as he talks to his daughter, currently at Nana-Nani's. Radhika now slowly emerges to wash and clean up, and dress her wounds.

The last and most poignant of the scenarios revolves back to the dining table where both Radhika and Nikhil are sitting calm, the shared knowledge between them heavy. Radhika asks Nikhil if he has told anyone about their situation and while Nikhil says he hasn't, Radhika says she has told Rita. Nikhil says that he didn't tell anyone on the slim chance that she might change her mind, and chuckles while saying so. Radhika is quick to point out it is good he laughed at that point, since the fact is truly funny. Radhika further clears it up to Nikhil that he shouldn't hang on to the fact, that she has made up her mind, her heart, and in fact many parts of her and they will not be easily changed. Nikhil, taking both her hands in his, asks her if that means he should start getting used to the fact that she isn't going to be around. Nikhil is a little surprised since he did not realize there was something so fundamentally wrong with both of them. Radhika then starts opening up, telling Nikhil all the things that were missing from their marriage. She says she thinks they do not treat each other well, that she isn't happy anymore, that she frowns in her sleep, as Nikhil himself pointed out to her one-day, and that she starting to look like her mother at 33 itself. Nikhil asks if this is because he doesn't say nice things anymore about the way she looks, and she admits that he wouldn't even notice anything different about her any more, for instance if she got a new haircut, that she is a woman, and that Krish never lets her forget that. Nikhil tries to rationally justify the difference between how he responded to that when they were dating and now. His stand is that now, instead of praising a new haircut, he would point out that her hair was in her eyes, since this was more logical due to actual concern. Radhika also recalls the times when she was taking a shower and Nikhil would sing to her, and for which he didn't have the time anymore now, and how she missed his voice, still misses his voice. Nikhil tries to sing and laughs it off as impossible since the situation isn't right. A bit of conversation more, and Nikhil suddenly breaks into the song, Over the Rainbow from the Wizard of Oz. He asks if he can make her laugh, and starts laughing himself. Radhika catches up on the infectious laugh and they both seem to bond in strange strength and maturity.

That Four-Letter Word

That Four Letter Word is an Indian independent English-language film from India written and directed by Sudhish Kamath. The film, which is about a group of friends at the crossroads of life, features a set of new actors including Aashil Nair, Cary Edwards, Evam Sunill, Usha Seetharam, Paloma Rao, Praveen Bharatwaj and Roshni Menon. The film premiered at the Chennai International Film Festival on 21 December 2006 and had a limited release in Chennai on 23 February 2007.


The story of the film was written by journalist Sudhish Kamath and his college friend, Murugan, during 1999. The film began its shoot in 2002 with video jockey Ranvir Shorey being the first person cast in the film, in the role of Zebra, after he became acquainted with Sudhish during an interview he had made to The Hindu. Shorey's colleague Purab Kohli had also expressed an interest in starring in the film but later got busy with the making of the Hindi film, "Supari" (2003), meaning that another video jockey, Carey Edwards, was cast in the role of Vishal. Cyrus Sahukar also joined the film in 2002 to portray the role of Sunil but later backed out and was replaced by actor Abbas, who had previously worked with Sudhish Kamath on a short film titled "‘Ellipsis". The shoot progressed intermittently throughout 2002 and 2003 before Shorey opted out citing bigger commitments and production delays. The team held unsuccessful negotiations with Cyrus Broacha to replace him, but his refusal meant that the team convinced and successfully re-signed Shorey to star in the film with a higher salary. Suchitra and video jockey Usha Seetharam were also attached to the film as the leading actresses. Costumes for the first version of the film were handled by designer Binu Jha.

However production troubles meant that progress was slow and with 95% of the shoot completed, the film was stalled. The team briefly considered financing the venture through in-film promotions but were unsuccessful at their attempt. As a result of the delays, it became difficult for the original set of actors to work together as they had full-time roles in different cities across India. Sudhish chose to start the film from scratch with a new set of actors, with the decision forcing Abbas to opt out of an acting role in the film. Among the notable new actors who joined the film were theatre actor Sunil Vishnu and video jockey Paloma Rao. Actor Madhavan also shot for a cameo for the final scene in the film. Made at a budget of 3 lakh rupees, it was the first independent digital film to be shot and released digitally in India.

The film premiere was held at the South India Film Chamber of Commerce to coincide with the 4th Chennai International Film Festival in Chennai, with two back-to-back screenings, the first of which was attended by film personalities, including actor Suriya, on 21 December 2006. It later had a limited release in Chennai in February 2007, where it ran for one show a day for three weeks at Sathyam Cinemas. The film was later released in Mumbai during September 2007, following screenings at film festivals in Bangladesh and Singapore.

Hindustan Ki Kasam (1999 film)

Hindustan Ki Kasam (Hindi: हिन्दुस्तान की कसम; Swear on India) is a 1999 Indian action film directed by Veeru Devgan and starring his son Ajay Devgn (in dual role), Amitabh Bachchan, Manisha Koirala and Sushmita Sen. The film was an average grosser, despite taking a bumper opening. The movie broke the opening day record in India at the time of its release and managed to do average business at the box office .

A mother gives birth to twins. The twins' father was an Indian Army officer who died in war. Unfortunately, they are separated at the end of the war when their father was celebrating their recent success in a battle with Pakistan. One of the twins end up in the neighboring Pakistan and is brought up as a Muslim named Tauheed. He was brought up by a terrorist who told him that his mother had died in an attack of Indian army, while the other grows up as a Hindu named Ajay Malhotra. Ajay is a novelist.

The movie begins with a montage of India's diversity and the Wagah border ceremony, as a song describes India's agelessness, sanctity, patriotism, and the Partition of India.

A boy runs in a city with an Indian flag in his hand to celebrate India's 50th Independence Day. He gives it to his impatient father, who grabs the flag by the cloth. An old man kicks the flag off the father's hand, introduces himself as Kabira, and rebukes him for his lack of respect for India. He had lost his right arm. When the boy and several others applaud Kabira, Kabira tells them not to clap for him, but to be more active in loving their country and protecting it from attack. He asks them to say "Jai Hind", and they repeat and salute him.

An Indian commander discusses his strategy to several military officers to stop Pakistan's attacks, by suggesting that evidence for Pakistan's terrorist activities should be collected and presented before the United Nations Organisation, which will then condemn Pakistan as a terrorist state. Meanwhile, a soldier hijacks a Pakistani aeroplane and tells the pilot (Aziz Kashmiri, an intelligence officer) to give to him a floppy disk. He and the pilot fight, and the pilot parachutes out of his aeroplane. The soldier jumps out of the airplane, and continues fighting the pilot in mid-air. He kills the pilot, retrieves the floppy disk, and uses the pilot's parachute to glide his way to the ground.

The Indian commander later holds a meeting with his officers about the pilot's plane crash, and tells them to work prudently to expose whoever who was responsible. In an airport, Ajay has his picture taken by a photojournalist and permits him to publish his picture. A woman arrives and asks him to sign his autograph, as she is a fan of his novels. When she asks him about where did he get his ideas, Ajay said that it was a trade secret, and leaves. The photojournalist asks the fan to let her sign his autograph, but she refuses and leaves.

At home, Ajay's mother asks him about his conference, and the photojournalist asks for food, which Ajay's mother prepares for him. As the photojournalist eats his food, she receives a government pension from a postman. Ajay asks his mother on why did she take alms, but his father Kabira answers that she is not taking alms, but respect. Kabira then lectures him about the contributions of India's freedom fighters who fought against foreign rule, with Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose as an example of a patriot.

On a street, Priya asks Ajay to take her on his motorcycle to the airport to get to the Miss Universe competition, and he performs several stunts to navigate through traffic and he confesses his love for her, until he wakes up from his daydream. Ajay sees Priya (as Miss India) on television winning second place in the competition, and goes to an airport to congratulate Priya. They fall in love.

Two Indian officers snatch a copy of Ajay's novel, and give it to their commander as proof of the murder of one of their officers, Major Chawla in New York. The Indian commander asks them to bring Ajay to him for interrogation. After he promises his mother to bring Priya home, Ajay and the photojournalist depart by airplane to Srinagar for photography. The Indian officers visit Ajay's house and inform their commander about Ajay's location.

Pajirao Marathe films a terrorist base near Srinagar that sought to take over the Kashmir region, and fights an Ajay-lookalike. He is then stabbed by the Ajay-lookalike, who takes his film recording away. When the two Indian officers report this to their commander, their commander uses a film of his military training to show that Ajay had also received military training as a commando, but was rejected from being a soldier due to his poor eyesight, and that Ajay is also planning his own schemes.

The real Ajay and Priya dance at a New Year's party, and was seized by the officers. The commander interrogates him about Pajirao's murder, which Ajay denies any involvement, and tells him that the events of his stories (which resembled the murders) were inspired by his dreams. Priya returns to Ajay's home and informs his mother that he has went missing. Ajay's mother later informs Kabira about Ajay's disappearance. After the commander orders Ajay to be tortured, one of the officers suggests that they use hypnosis to extract the origin of his novels' plots, and they send Ajay to Dr. Dastoor. During the session, Ajay recalls his childhood (where he recalls several children hiding from enemy soldiers), his shooting of a Pakistani army chief and his officer from his helicopter, and using that helicopter to kill the officer's truck. The commander then orders his officers to observe Ajay carefully.

Ajay returns home, and asks his mother about the "Aunt Geeta" that he had heard in his dreams. Ajay's mother shows him a photograph of their family, and recounts the Pakistani-led raid that took away his brother Raju and killed Aunt Geeta when the family visited an army base to celebrate the end of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Kabira adds that he was also there when he lost his right arm to a grenade thrown by a Pakistani soldier, who also took Raju away before his very eyes. When the family visits Dr. Dastoor, he explains that Ajay and Raju have a sort of bond that affects both of them if one of them is affected. Dr. Dastoor also adds that the incidents that Ajay sees in his dreams are his brother's experiences, and Ajay requests that he should not tell his mother about his brother's shared experiences.

With the ongoing rivalry and hatred between the two countries, both find themselves on the opposite side, and must battle each other. The only way they can unite is by saving the life of the Prime Minister of Pakistan, who himself has become the target of terrorists. When


"Qadam Qadam Badaye Ja", the regimental quick march of the Indian National Army of Subhash Chandra Bose, is used in the segment where Bose makes his speech.

Unfortunately the robbers have no intention of just rolling over.


Ron Ahluwalia from Planet Bollywood gave the film 2.5/10 and stated "Burying your money in the ground would be wiser than even renting a movie like Paisa Vasool. It's just that simple: don't watch it!"

Apunkachoice gave the film 3/5 stating 'at times the humor in the film is too predictable and there are other sequences that are simply puerile. Even the two leading characters Baby and Maria are made to overreact in many situations'.

Ron Ahluwalia from Planet Bollywood gave the soundtrack 4/10 and chose 'Yaadon Mein' as his favorite song stating 'It’s a shame that Manisha was not able to get more songs like Yaadon Mein out of her composers and lyricist. This soundtrack should be looked upon as a pathetic follow-up by Bapi-Tutul on their work in Bhoot. In the end, one beautiful song cannot save a host of repulsive songs. Forget that Paisa Vasool ever had a soundtrack!'

Satyajit from Smashhits.com called the soundtrack 'a complete washout' stating that the soundtrack is 'rather a rehashed version of many remix albums'.

The film was initially titled as "Mohabbat Aur Karz" in the year 1988; later, director Raj Kanwar started the film in 1999 as "Saath Pichle Janam Ka", featuring Saif Ali Khan and Mahima Chaudhary in lead roles, but Saif asked for more salary that was beyond the budget, Mahima too asked for the same, due to which Raj Kanwar shelved the movie. Finally the film was started in 2002 with newcomers Arya Babbar and Amrita Rao as "Ab Ke Baras".

Jugnu (1947 film)

Jugnu () is a 1947 Indian film directed by Shaukat Hussain Rizvi. The film stars Noor Jehan, Dilip Kumar, Ghulam Mohammad, Jillo, Latika, Shashikala and now famous playback singer Mohammed Rafi in a cameo appearance.

Both Shaukat Hussain Rizvi and his wife Noor Jehan settled in Pakistan shortly after the film was released.

Sooraj is from a wealthy household. He meets Jugnu when he tries to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff and Jugnu tries to stop him. In reality, it was a ploy conceived by Sooraj and his friends to distract Jugnu and all the girls so that they can steal the food prepared by the girls. All of them study in the same college and live in a hostel. And thus, slowly, on meeting a few times, Jugnu and Sooraj fall in love with each other. Jugnu was orphaned when she was young and is taken care of by a friend of her father's, who wishes for her to be married to his son Dilip. Sooraj's parents come to know about his love for Jugnu and oppose the match as Jugnu is poor. One day, in a conversation with his father, Sooraj comes to know that they are not rich as all the assets (bungalow, things etc.) owned by his father are mortgaged under a heavy loan and so he plans to arrange the marriage of Sooraj to a rich household so that the dowry received will help them pay off the loan and continue living a wealthy life. Sooraj is surprised to hear this, but he nevertheless is happy as now he can marry Jugnu as both are poor. But Sooraj's mother goes to Jugnu and pleads for her son's life explaining her predicament and Jugnu promises her that she will get out of Sooraj's life. What happens next is the central plot of the story. Will Sooraj and Jugnu meet again? Will the difference be sorted out between them? Will the lovers love be sacrificed for parents' happiness and money?

This movie was the first hit of Dilip Kumar.

Feroz Nizami provided superb music for this film, film song lyrics were written by the top lyricists of the time including Adeeb Saharanpuri (G. M. Adeeb) and Asghar Sarhadi. Most of the film songs ended-up being super-hit.

"Jugnu" grossed 50 lakh (US$5 million) in India, making it the highest-grossing Indian film of 1947. When adjusted for inflation, its gross in 2016 value is equivalent to 363 crore (US$ million). This is the highest for any Indian film at the time, until it was surpassed by "Awaara" (1951).

Mahal (1949 film)

Mahal (Hindi: महल, ) is a 1949 Indian Hindi film directed by Kamal Amrohi and starring Ashok Kumar and Madhubala. It was India's first reincarnation thriller film.

Produced by Bombay Talkies studio, this, Kamal Amrohi's directorial debut, launched both playback singer Lata Mangeshkar and the leading lady Madhubala into super-stardom. Its songs, particularly "Aayega Aanewala" sung by Lata Mangeshkar, are perennial favourites. Rajkumari sang two other well-known songs from the film, "Mein Woh Dulhan Hoon" and "Yeh Raat Phir Na Aayenge". Their lyrics were written by Nakshab. Rajkumari also sang these songs live on a Channel 4 (a UK TV station) programme called "Mahfil", aired on 24 March 1991.

"Mahal" made Lata Mangeshkar famous and established playback singers as stars in their own right. Before "Mahal", records listed character names and the first batch of records credited "Aayega aane wala" to Kamini, the character played by Madhubala. When the song first played on All India Radio, its phone lines were flooded with callers inquiring the singer's name. All India Radio had to find this out from the record company before it could announce Lata Mangeshkar's name on the air. The film was included in the British Film Institute's list, "10 great romantic horror films".

The movie was a groundbreaking supernatural suspense thriller and one of the earliest known films dealing with reincarnation. "Mahal" became one of the biggest box office hits of 1949 in India and paved way for Indian gothic fiction.

Mahal is a story of reincarnation and a ghost story. In Allahabad, there is a beautiful abandoned palace. When a new owner, Hari Shankar (Ashok Kumar), comes to live in this palace, the old gardener narrates the story of incomplete love.

40 years ago, a man built it and his lover, Kamini (Madhubala), began to live in it. She would wait all day long for the man to come to her at midnight, but he always left before it was morning. One stormy night, the man's ship sank and he drowned. Before leaving Kamini, he tells her that their love will never fail. A few days later, Kamini also died.

When Shankar goes to a bedroom, a photograph falls from the wall and Shankar is astonished to find the man in the photograph looks exactly like him. Then, a woman is heard singing and Shankar follows her voice. He finds her sitting in a room, but she flees when she sees him. Shankar's friend Shrinath (Kanu Roy) arrives and Shankar expresses suspicion on his being the man of the incomplete love story in a previous life. Shrinath tries to calm him, but then the woman reappears. They follow her to the terrace, where she jumps off into water and the two men find nothing when they look down. The next day, Shankar heads back to Kanpur. At Naini, he gets off from a train and goes to the palace. Kamini tells him that she is real, but Shrinath interferes and warns Shankar that she will draw him to death. The ghost appears again and tells Shrinath to stay away from them. Enraged, Shrinath tries to shoot her but fails. Kamini tells Shankar that if she could enter into a body of a woman whom Shankar likes, she could return to life. She tells Shankar to see the gardener's daughter's face to check if she's beautiful and he can accept Kamini in that face. Meanwhile, Shankar's father arrives after hearing everything from Shrinath and takes him home. Shankar gets married to Ranjana (Vijayalaxmi). He decides to move far away with his wife in order to forget Kamini. After two years, a disturbed Ranjana wanting to know where Shankar goes every night, follows him when he goes to meet Kamini. Kamini tells him to kill the gardener's daughter so that she can use her body. Knowing everything, Ranjana drinks poison and goes to police station to give a deathbed confession against Shankar of betrayal and poisoning her. Shanker is submitted to the court and the daughter of the gardener, Asha, is also called upon there being accused of the cause of distance between Shankar and Ranjana. Later Asha is revealed to be Kamini. She then accepts that she has played Kamini because she had fallen in love with the man in the photograph, who looks like Shankar. But Shankar is sentenced to death. Later, the police come to know about Ranjana's letter and free Shankar. Shankar rushes to Shrinath's place but dies. The credits roll as a grieving Kamini and Shrinath walk away.

Many established actresses and new faces were screen-tested for the coveted female lead. The part was written with the then-reigning superstar, Suraiya in mind. However, after two screen tests, the fledgling Madhubala, only 16 at the time was selected. The film was key in defining her screen persona and establishing her as one of the most successful and illustrious actresses of the 1950s.

For the lyrics written by Nakshab Jaarchavi for all the songs of the film, the music of the songs was composed by Khemchand Prakash. Tun Tun was initially offered to sing "Aayega Aanewala", but she refused the offer because of her contract with Kardar Productions.

Bimal Roy, who was the editor for "Mahal", would later go on to direct "Madhumati", which itself went on to become the source of inspiration for many later works dealing with the theme of reincarnation in Indian cinema, Indian television, and perhaps world cinema. It was the source of inspiration for the American film "The Reincarnation of Peter Proud" (1975) and the Hindi film "Karz" (1980), both of which dealt with reincarnation and have been influential in their respective cultures. "Karz" in particular was remade several times: as the Kannada film "Yuga Purusha" (1989), the Tamil film "Enakkul Oruvan" (1984), and "Om Shanti Om"

<doc id="10301701" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10301701" title="Uttara (film)">
Uttara (film)

Uttara (, ) is a 2000 Bengali language drama film thriller directed by Bengali poet Buddhadev Dasgupta. Based on a short story by Samaresh Bose, it stars Jaya Seal as Uttara, Tapas Paul, Shankar Chakraborty, Raisul Islam Asad as a Christian missionary.

The film contrasts violence, human vices and lawlessness in a seemingly peaceful setting, in a quiet village in Purulia district in Bengal.

"Uttara" premiered at the Venice Film Festival on 30 August 2000 and was the winner of the festivals' Special Director award. It was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2000 and on 22 May it was shown in the US at the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival The film was released in France on 13 June 2001 and won the Audience Award at the Nantes festival. It opened the Pusan Film Festival in South Korea.

Due to its homoerotic undertones, "Uttara" was shown at a number of gay and lesbian film festivals including the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival.

The way the movie depicts the development of the plot conveys this violation of a peaceful world. The series of disjunctive shots of the threads of the story that follow the opening utopian shot disrupt any notions of linearity, making the audience feel the conflict of the forces that destroys the village. One of these scenes shows an army of dwarfs traversing mountains, plains, and rivers, suggesting the search for an alternative world. As the dwarf who tries to help Uttara explains, these people have grown weary of the world of 'tall people', which full of cruelty and despair, and seek an alternate world. This is a metaphor for the wider world plagued by inequality and corruption. The troupe of masked folk dancers, who meander through the village, function in a mythic framework, representing the continuity of culture and tradition, and act as a stabilizing force in the various conflicts that mar the idyllic world of the village.

The schism between the friends is illustrated in the wrestling, which gradually becomes an overpowering obsession. Instead of expressing bonding, it takes on the colour of a power-game between two equally physically strong and morally weak men. The wrestling irrespective of homoerotic undertones is a deliberate destruction where one aims to destroy the other, as each morally unjust man attempts to win the physical 'possession' of Uttara.

Although an allegorical, cautionary tale on religious fundamentalism, between Christianity and Hinduism, "Uttara" is also an incisive examination of the provincialism, anachronism, moral and social injustice, and inherent contradiction. Contradiction is very important element in the film, for example the Christian missionary Padre who dispenses of his food wastefully at a rural village ravaged by poverty in exchange for converting desperate (and undernourished) souls, and a band of Hindu zealots aggressively roaming the landscape in their off-road utility vehicle and behaving in a manner completely with disregard to others contrary to the Hindu faith.

Another important aspect of the film is the way in which the dwarfs don pagan masks and ritualistically perform an ancient parade through the village. The seemingly pantheistic ancient dance is intended to represent an instinctual connection to roots and tradition becoming a metaphor for the sense of duty that has become increasingly sublimated in an environment of self-interest, vanity, gluttony and strong jealousy and competition. It is this contrasted, parallel image of reverence for the cycle of nature that renders Buddhadeb Dasgupta's vision of Indian society as a complex and tragic one, illustrating that society is overcome by hypocrisy. The barbaric behaviour of the city-dwellers is also intended to reflect the deviance of human nature in modern urban society, as it becomes plagued by declining moral values and terrorized by the inhumanity of extremism.

The film is shot strikingly with visual imagination of the rural pastoral landscapes, the solitary huts of the wrestlers and the isolated church, contrasted against the malignant presence of the three urban yobs and their brutality. Filmmaker Buddhadeb Dasgupta employs a unique strategy of shooting where he consistently shot periods of "Uttara" just after dawn and before sunset to emphasise the natural lighting on the landscape and to create atmosphere. In addition, this is precisely matched with reverse angle shots and unusually deep focus for framing and blocking. The cumulative result of such a technique adds to the formal unease, in a world where distinct natural beauty and deadly human menace coexist in equal measure. The cinematography, with the increasing or diminishing light of day is intended to directly coincide with the volatile changes in the ambience and mood of the film. The intense sunrise in one of the scenes as tension surmounts attempts to exude a feeling of heat, giving reflecting the burning emotions between the two wrestlers who are overcome by lust and jealousy.

The sounds that accompany these images play into this reiteration of theme on a more abstract level, ranging from the eerie silence that accompanies the menacing presence of the three goons, to the death knell that sounds as a rock rolls down while the wrestlers fight to kill each other. The audio occasionally uses a lot of rhythm and beats, for instance during the escapades of the three yobs, but this is sometimes juxtaposed by images and sounds of tranquility, the shots of the orchard accompanied by a soothing tune, and the troupe of dancers with their folk culture, that signify hope for the future.

Kaathala Kaathala

Kaathala Kaathala is a 1998 Indian Tamil-language comedy film directed by Singeetam Srinivasa Rao and produced by P. L. Thenappan. The film stars Kamal Haasan, Prabhu Deva, Soundarya and Rambha in the lead roles with an ensemble cast in supporting roles. The film released on 10 April 1998, to positive reviews and became a commercial success. The film was later loosely remade in Hindi as "Housefull".

Ramalingam and Sundaralingam are orphans who takes care of themselves and some other orphan children. Sundaralingam is a professional painter who paints shop banners and calendars. Ramalingam is the man who finds way to make money, usually by means of fraud. He even acts as a handicap together with godman Ananda Vikadanantha and his partner. Sundari, an arts student falls for him. Her friend Janaki falls for Sundaralingam. Janaki's father, Paramasivam, does not agree to Janaki marrying a poor man. This prompts Janaki and Sundaralingam to get married with their help of their friends.

Days go by but Paramasivam does not agree. This causes Sundari to ask Janaki to lie to Paramasivam that she gave birth to a son. Paramasivam upon receiving the letter, changes his mind and gets ready to set off to Chennai. Sundari had lied to her Chicago based father, Balamurugan that Ramalingam is a rich man. Janaki, to easily convince her parents, lies that Sundaralingam became rich. The girls rent a big bungalow from a lady called Noorjahan, who mistakes Janaki and Sundaralingam as a couple. They rent the house for three days.

Sundari's father was supposed to come on that day but misses his flight. Janaki's parents want to surprise her and they end up coming on that day. Ramalingam mistakes Janaki's father as Sundari's father. Unable to tell the truth because of Noorjahan, Janaki and Ramalingam let it be. They also without any choice, make Sundari as the servant maid and Sundaralingam as the cook. Sundari borrows a child from a beggar women, who stays in the house in the name of a milk woman.

The four of them strive hard to hide the truth from Janaki's parents. In between these, Varathachari, Paramasivam's friend who knows the reality comes home. After avoiding anything wrong, they encounter Janaki's maternal uncle, 'Security' Singaram. He is a very doubtful person who pressurize the youths, and starts suspecting them. Yet, he fails to convince his sister and brother-in-law.

When Balamurugan is on the way, Paramasivam steps in to help them, without knowing the truth at all. He concocts a more complicated story, where Ramalingam is his son, Janaki and Sundaralingam reprising their real relationship and worse, V. Anand to be his cousin. Anand is actually Ananda Vikadanantha who is absconding. When more of this happens, the elders smell something fishy and everything falls onto Ramalingam's head. To put an end to all these, Sundari reveals the complete truth to everyone. Singaram tells all that Anand is the fraud and once again, Ramalingam has to prove his innocence.

A chase ensues when V. Anand is held hostage by his ex-partner Junior Vikadanantha for money which he looted. Inspector Chokkalingam arrives in time to find Ananda Vikadanantha and Junior and Ramalingam is proven innocent. Paramasivam accepts Janaki and Sundaralingam, and Balamurugan is happy about Ramalingam and Sundari.


"Kaathala Kaathala" was initially expected to be directed by K. S. Ravikumar who directed the successful "Avvai Shanmughi" with Kamal Haasan in the lead earlier, but he was later replaced by Singeetam Srinivasa Rao after he refused to sign the film until the FEFSI strike of 1997 had stopped. Actresses Meena and Simran's unavailability led to Rambha being cast in a lead role. Nagma also opted against signing the film fearing that a potential clash may arise with actress Rambha, after the pair's alleged fall out on the sets of "Janakiraman". After Soundarya's death in 2004, Kamal Haasan paid tribute by revealing that "she came forward to do the movie, when the rest of the industry was unwilling to work with me."

"Kaathala Kaathala" was released on 10 April 1998. Namma Ooru Velan from "Indolink" gave the film a positive review, citing that "if one can put the inspirations behind, the movie is quite enjoyable" and that "the going gets very complicated and absolutely hilarious".

In 2010, the producer of the film P. L. Thenappan threatened legal action against the makers of the Hindi film, "Housefull" for remaking scenes from the film without permission. Thenappan revealed he had dubbed the film into Hindi in the late 1990s as "Mirchi Masala", but the version did not release.

The soundtrack was composed by Karthik Raja and lyrics written by Vaali.

The line "Jaanaki enakku wife aagittathaala, Sundari velakkaari aayittaappaa" (Ever since Janaki became my wife, Sundari became a housemaid) became popular, and has since entered Tamil vernacular as a term used by people to "tease friends caught impersonating".

Radhakrishnan replaced Vidyasagar as the music director and Kavya Madhavan replaced Meera Jasmine as the actress. The audiography of the film was done by M. R. Rajakrishnan . It was also dubbed in Tamil, Telugu (as "Sivapuram"),Hindi as Phir Wohi Darr. and English, and was an inspiration for "Tanthra" (2006), another Malayalam film.

In the ancient village of Shivapuram, little Ananthan hears a tale from his mother, Gayathri (Revathi). She tells him that his family comes from a line of powerful magicians, and they are responsible for protecting "nagamanikyam", a jewel on a serpent's head. The jewel, she narrates, lies in a secret place in the house guarded by snakes, including a tiny snake called Kunjootan.

Years later, obeying the wishes of his dead mother, Ananthan (Prithviraj Sukumaran) returns to his ancestral village to light the lamps at "Shivakavu", a dark and mysterious temple of Shiva. On his way home he meets the comical Maravi Mathai (Cochin Haneefa) on the train. The local black magician Digambaran (Manoj K Jayan) opposes the lighting of the lamps on the grounds of local superstitions in order get his hands on the "nagamanikyam". Disbeliever Ananthan meets the supernatural for the first time in his life.

In his effort to fit into the local environment, Ananthan gradually wins the villagers' hearts over by his easy and kind manners. This appreciation is breached briefly when the magician takes over his mind for a short while. Meanwhile, Ananthan's cousin Bhadra (Kavya Madhavan) falls for him and his light-hearted flirting, eventually leading to a commitment of love between them. At one point, Bhadra faces the dilemma of choosing between Ananthan's love and becoming a Devi (goddess) in a mystical ritual of self-offering.

Chemban (Kalabhavan Mani), a blind martial arts expert, stands in the way of Digambaran's hunt for the "nagamanikyam". The evil black magician manages to remove Chemban from his way, and leaves a trail of blood in his wake. Digambaran also lures Chemban's sister and his lover Bhama (Riya Sen). A series of sensuous and evil magical rites follows that features a wide paraphernalia of the exotic, including Kathakali movements, tantric paraphernalia, traditional magic spells.

In the end, Ananthan and Bhadra escape Digambaran's sinister tricks and unravel his conspiracy in front of the villagers, who believed him to be a benevolent mystic. The fight at the end sees Digambaran lost his eyes and Ananthan restoring the "nagamanikyam".

Kerala State Film Awards 2005


"Ananthabhadram" is based on the novel of the same name by Sunil Parameswaran. The story was inspired by tales told to Sunil by his grandmother when he was a child. Director Santosh Sivan was also influenced by such stories told by his own grandmother. Set in rural Kerala, the story is a fairy tale dominated by Shakta black magic, martial arts, and tantric seduction rituals.

Theyyam and Kathakali: Sivan said he received inspiration from the arts of his country: "We have a rich visual culture and even in Ananthabhadram, I have used certain aspects from Theyyam dancers and Kathakali to create the wizard Digambaran's image. The colour, long nails, kohl-lined eyes and so on were inspired from Theyyam and Kathakali." The sequence between Manoj K Jayan using Riya Sen as a channel for black magic, choreographed by Aparna Sindhoor, the dance director of the film, uses Kathakali movements in particular, which has been an inspiration for major Indian films like director Shaji Karun's "Vanaprastham" (1999) and director Adoor Gopalakrishnan's "Kalamandalam Ramankutty Nair" (2005).

Kalarippayattu: The film also used Kalarippayattu, the traditional martial art of South India, for the fight sequences between Digambaran and Chemban choreographed by action director Arash. Use of Kalari in the film followed the footsteps of Kalari-based movies like "Palattu Koman" (1962), "Thacholi Othenan" (1964), "Kannappanunni" (1977) and "Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha" (1989), as well as famous martial art film actor Jackie Chan's "The Myth". After "Asoka", it was the second time the director had used Kalari (as it is known in popular coinage).

Raja Ravi Varma: The director used three paintings of Raja Ravi Varma – "Damayanti and the swan", "Lady in thought" and "Girl carrying milk tray" – as inspiration to picturize the song "Pinakkamano" (acted by Prithviraj Sukumaran and Kavya Madhavan; sung by M. G. Sreekumar and Manjari; choreographed by Aparna Sindhoor). Sivan said, "Yes, it is a tribute to Raja Ravi Varma, who is so intrinsically etched in every Malayali's mind." This song came in the wake of a renewed interest in Varma's work in Indian showbiz, as evidenced in Indian pop star Falguni Pathak's music video for the song "Meri Chunar Ud Ud Jaaye" (2001, acted by Trisha Krishnan) which emulated Varma's "Shakuntala" and Shaji Karun's declared film to be made on the artist's life which would feature Madhuri Dixit (actress of "Gaja Gamini", a film by painter M.F. Hussain).

Pattanam Rasheed said about the make-up of the "Pinakkamano" sequence, "The skin tone I gave the characters is akin to an oil painting, orange-yellow shades, which give a painting-like look. That is why you feel that a painting is coming to life in some shots. The eye and eye brow make-up is also different, according to the old styles in the paintings." Costumer Satheesh said, "Not one of the saris that Kavya wears is complete in itself. To get the colours of the body and border of the sari as close as possible to the ones in the paintings, I shopped in Chennai, Bangalore and Kochi. I had to attach the borders to some of the saris and dyed some to get the right shade... I had to rework all the jewels, with a few stones from one chain added to another." art director Sunil Babu points out that despite attempts at accuracy, in the Damayanthi scene, the swan is missing.

Sabu Cyril was originally scheduled to direct the film with actress Meera Jasmine in the lead. Production was delayed due to a strike in the Malayalam film industry in June 2004. Later, Cyril became busy with Shankar's film "Anniyan". At this point, Santosh Sivan stepped in to replace Cyril. Cyril's assistant Sunil Babu art directed the film.

Like his earlier directorial ventures "Asoka" and "The Terrorist" (a.k.a. "Malli"), Santosh was also the cinematographer for "Anathabhadram". Kavya Madhavan replaced Meera as the female lead and gave a performance that established her as the top heroine of the Malayalam Film Industry that year, aided by both commercial success and critical acclaim. Prithviraj Sukumaran as the male lead also had his biggest success of 2005, out of the five films he did that year. Manoj K Jayan was to have a "sannyasin" look with long hair in the proposed Sabu Cyril version, but sported a more contemporary look in the version that was eventually shot, winning much critical accolades.

Initially Sabu Cyril was the film director and Santhosh Sivan was the Cinematographer. Vidyasagar composed songs for the film penned by Sreekumaran Thampi. The songs were never recorded. After some months Sabu Cyril opted not to direct the film due to other reasons. And the film was taken over by Santosh Sivan who appointed M. G. Radhakrishnan for the film. Radhakrishnan went on to win Asianet Film Awards as the best music director for the film's tracks. He also did the score for "Sivapuram", the Telugu version of the film. M. G. Sreekumar won Asianet Award as the Best Male Playback Singer for singing "Pinakkamano".

It is the first Malayalam feature screened using a satellite feed instead of conventional prints; aimed at an international market. it was also dubbed in Tamil, Telugu (as "Sivapuram"), and English. The release of "Anandabhadram" in India followed that of the horror movie "Chandramukhi", starring Rajnikanth, which was a remake of the Malayalam film "Manichitrathazhu", creating a brief success for the horror genre. The film was showcased in Osian's Cinefan Festival of Asian and Arab Cinema in 2006.

"Anandabhadram" was a commercial successes. "Pinakkamano" became the top hit among Malayalam film songs in 2005. The film also inspired director KJ Bose's "Tanthra" (2006) featuring actors Siddique and Shweta Menon. Sunil Babu, the art director, came to the notice of Kerala audience because of the film, especially his treatment for Raja Ravi Varma inspired songs. The performance of Manoj K. Jayan was critically acclaimed.

"Anandabhadram" won five awards in the Kerala State Film Awards for 2005, including Best Cinematography (Santosh Sivan), Best Music Direction (MG Radhakrishnan), Best Editing (Sreekar Prasad), Best Art Direction (Sunil Babu) and Best Makeup (Pattanam Rasheed). It won five awards in the Kerala Film Critics Association Awards 2005, including Best Film, Best Director (Santhosh Sivan), Best Actor (Manoj K Jayan), and Best Cinematography (Santhosh Sivan). M. R. Rajakrishnan had won the Amritha Fertanity Award for Best Audiography for his work in this film.

Bandhan (1998 film)

Bandhan (transl. Bond) is a 1998 Bollywood drama/action film starring Jackie Shroff, Salman Khan, Rambha and Ashwini Bhave. The film was a remake of the Tamil film "Pandithurai". The film was a third hit of Salman Khan after "Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya" and "Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai" in the following year.

Thakur Suraj Pratap (Jackie Shroff) sees a young woman performing pooja at a temple, and instantly falls in love with her. This is Pooja (Ashwini Bhave), who belongs to a poor family, consisting of her dad, Ramlal, her mom and a kid brother named Raju (Salman Khan). Thakur sends an emissary to Ramlal, who is delighted to give his daughter to Thakur in marriage, and the wedding is celebrated with due ceremony. Pooja is very fond of Raju and takes him along with her to her husband's house. This is the only "gift" that Pooja's impoverished parents are able to give their daughter at the wedding, and it is also beneficial for the young boy to grow up in a more affluent household. At the Thakur's palatial home, Pooja is greeted by Jyoti (Rambha), Thakur's kid sister.

The years pass. Unfortunately, Pooja has been unable to bear children. Raju, now grown up, is intensely attached and loyal to Thakur, his brother-in-law. He and Thakur's sister Jyoti are in love. One day, Thakur meets Vaishali (Shweta Menon), a courtesan who sings and dances for a living. Vaishali has no relatives except one brother, an unscrupulous card-sharp named Gajendra who lives off his sister's earnings. Vaishali seduces the Thakur and becomes his mistress. Her brother, posing as a respectable man, demands that Thakur marry Vaishali and make the relationship public. Thakur is reluctant. On the one hand, he possibly hopes that Vaishali will make him a father. On the other hand, he is attached to his dutiful wife and loving brother-in-law. Gajendra and his friends hatch a plot to kill two birds with one stone: to induce Thakur to marry Vaishali, and at the same time, break the strong relationship between Thakur and Raju. The conspirators make a fool of Raju, as a result of which he causes the police to raid Gajendra's house, on the allegation that the house is being used as a brothel. During the police raid, Raju is horrified to find that the 'customer' found in Vaishali's company is none other than his brother-in-law. Thakur is also angered to find that the person who has caused him this infamy and police entanglement is none other than Raju. In order to avoid legal proceedings, Thakur tells the police that he is present in the house in order to discuss the possibility of marrying Vaishali, the reason being that his wife has remained childless. Raju falls at Thakur's feet, begs forgiveness, and pleads with him not to take a second wife. His pleas fall on deaf ears; Thakur duly marries Vaishali and takes her home. Raju tells his parents of what has happened, of how Pooja now has a co-wife. They come to Thakur's mansion and create a scene. Annoyed at the commotion, Thakur tells Pooja to make her choice once and for all: she can either accept Vaishali as her co-wife and remain in his household with the respectability of being the senior wife, or depart with her parents for good. Pooja chooses to remain with her husband and co-wife, for as she says, that is her wifely duty; her husband's house is the only suitable residence for a married woman. Raju, who has lived in Thakur's household for many years, now goes away with his parents.

These events cause a great rift between the two families, because of which the two lovers (Raju and Jyoti) are separated. Vaishali is ensconced in the Thakur's mansion, and her brother becomes Thakur's confidant. He now wants to marry Thakur's sister, Jyoti, so that he and his sister Vaishali will totally control the vast wealth of the Thakur family. A naïve Thakur is taken in by his new brother-in-law's seeming decency, and it is arranged that Gajendra will marry Jyoti. However, Jyoti bravely refuses to marry anyone except Raju. She is supported by Pooja, who makes the point that it would be wrong and even sinful for Jyoti to marry one man while being in love with another; chasteness of the mind is as important as chasteness of the body.

Thakur decides to delay the matter for the time being. Gajendra is aghast at this and makes a plan to abduct Jyoti so that afterward she will have no choice but to marry him. He reveals his plan to his sister and asks her to help him, but Vaishali has undergone a personality change after her marriage. She now wants to be a respectable woman and is extremely grateful to Thakur for having given her the chance to reform. She berates and opposes her brother, and makes it clear that she will inform her husband. Gajendra feels betrayed by his sister and sees that she has gained so much (Thakur's wealth, his social standing and the respectability of wifehood), whereas he, Gajendra, has, in fact, lost his only source of income, which was the money from his sister's song-and-dance performances. In a fit of rage, he plunges a knife into Vaishali's stomach and kills her. He then makes an effort to frame Thakur for Vaishali's murder. There are some further (rather incomprehensible) shenanigans until, in the climax, Thakur realizes that he has been used and manipulated, and also that Raju (the hero of the film), is the epitome of goodness, loyalty, affection, and every noble human quality. At Thakur's behest, Raju dispatches the villains, rescues Jyoti and protects Thakur's honour, gamely taking a bullet in the shoulder during the Big Fight. He survives to dance another song, and Thakur, now reconciled with his beloved and loyal Raju, gives Jyoti in marriage to him. The two couples live happily ever after, with great love existing both within each couple and between the two couples.

Paruthiveeran

Paruthiveeran () is a 2007 Indian Tamil-language epic romantic drama film written and directed by Ameer Sultan. The film stars Karthi in his feature film debut as the title character, with Priyamani as the female lead and Ponvannan, Saravanan, Ganja Karuppu, Sampath Raj, and Sujatha Sivakumar playing supporting roles. Produced by Studio Green, it features a soundtrack and score composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, cinematography by Ramji and editing by Raja Mohammad.

"Paruthiveeran" was entirely shot in Madurai and its surroundings. After two years of making, the film was released on 23 February 2007 and received universal critical acclaim. Priyamani was awarded National film award for best actress for her performance as "Muththazhagu" in that year. The film won prizes at major film award ceremonies in India, including two National Film Awards, six Filmfare Awards South and two Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, among others, whilst being screened at several international film festivals such as the Berlin International Film Festival and the Osian's Cinefan Festival of Asian and Arab Cinema as well. It also emerged a high commercial success, running successfully for more than one year in theatres.

The story is set in a rural area around Madurai in the village called Paruthiyur, which still practices caste segregation as a result of the controversial Criminal Tribes Act imposed by the British colonists, where members of impoverished communities are stereotyped as generational criminals.

Paruthiveeran (Karthi) is a country brash whose inter-caste parents were ostracized by the villagers since his higher caste father married his lower caste mother. After his parents' death, Paruthiveeran was mostly raised by his doting paternal uncle Chevvaazhai (Saravanan), who pampers and accompanies him in every misbehavior to keep him happy. Having grown up among his mother's people, he is often arrested for petty crimes. His one ambition in life is to gain enough notoriety to be on TV news and to be thrown into Madras Jail. He often bullies Paruthiyur villagers for money and fun.

Paruthiveeran's cross cousin Muththazhagu (Priyamani) is the daughter of his snobbish uncle who is a respected member of the village's council and a caste sectarian. Muththazhagu has been in love with Paruthiveeran since childhood, but he remains unmoved and keeps her at bay. When they were children, Paruthiveeran saved Muththazhagu from drowning in a well. She promised to marry him and be by his side forever and starts to love him against her parents' will as they do not approve of Parututhiveeran's inter-caste background. In order to delay her marriage with anybody else, she fails in her tests at school on purpose to be in the same grade class as Paruthiveeran. At times, Paruthiveeran is violent towards her, but she still loves him. When Paruthiveeran finally accepts Muththazhagu's love for him and decides to marry her, the feud between the two families comes in the way.

Determined to marry Muththazhagu, he warns her against marrying anyone else by threatening to cut her into pieces. Undeterred by his threats, her parents press ahead with the preparations for her marriage with a boy of their choice. Since Muththazhagu is not able to convince her parents otherwise, she runs away from home in order to elope with Paruthiveeran. However, while hiding away in an abandoned building while Paruthiveeran is away making necessary arrangements, she comes across four of Paruthiveeran's acquaintances who mistake her for one of his prostitutes. They brutally gang rape her and leave her to die.

Later, Paruthiveeran returns and finds her dying. She beseeches Paruthiveeran to cut her into pieces as she does not want anybody to find her in her present state. Paruthiveeran, on her request, chops her corpse into pieces. While walking away in a neurotic state, he is found by Muththazhagu's father Kazhuvathevan (Ponvannan) and her other relatives. Assuming him to be her kidnapper and killer, they beat him to death.


For the title character, Karthi, brother of Suriya, was chosen to portray the part. Although Karthi revealed he preferred directing to acting, he agreed to take up acting since his father convinced him to do so. When director Ameer approached him to play the titular character in the film he accepted the offer because the film was " ... so compelling".

About 60 debutants, mostly real-time people from the region, appeared in the film. The number of newcomers who acted in the film, notably, outweighed the number of professional artists, with Priyamani, Ponvannan, Saravanan and Ganja Karuppu being the only four experienced actors. Furthermore, no dubbing artists were involved in the production and all artists were brought to Chennai had dubbed their original voice, 
Filming was held at various locations that, according to Ameer, were never before explored by Tamil cinema. A village carnival was created by art director Jacki for the film and shot for 10 days in Karumathur, Madurai. The filming started in July 2005 and experienced financial difficulties, and was almost abandoned by mid–2006. The film's director Ameer Sultan taking over the production and later by Gnanavel Raja. He later stated that he had incurred heavy financial loss as a producer of the film.

The film's score as well as the soundtrack were scored by Yuvan Shankar Raja, teaming up with his friend Ameer Sultan following two successive successful collaborations in "Mounam Pesiyadhe" (2002) and "Raam" (2005). The soundtrack album was released on 29 Decrember 2006 at Green Park Hotel in Chennai, with several prominent film personalities participating in the event, including fellow actor Vijay, who launched the audio. The album consists of six songs, including one instrumental track, featuring the nadaswaram only. It features vocals from Yuvan Shankar Raja's father Ilaiyaraaja, director Ameer himself and professional playback singers Shreya Ghoshal, Manikka Vinayagam and Madhumitha. Moreover, a couple of traditional, village-based singers contributed to the album by lending their voice to a few songs. All lyrics were written by Snehan. "Paruthiveeran" was notably the first ever entirely village-based film Yuvan Shankar Raja had scored music for. He composed a folk music-based score and used rural sounds with instruments as dholak, nadaswaram, thavil and urumee.

Yuvan Shankar Raja received critical acclaim for his score, while the soundtrack album initially got mostly unfavorable reviews, being described as a "letdown" and "disappointment", raising to question whether it could attract today's "modern" audience. Following the film's release however, critics unanimously made very positive remarks in regards to the film score. Baradwaj Rangan labelled it a "magnificently earthy score", while Malathi Rangarajan noted that the composer "proves he is a chip off the old block in rustic music too". Other critics hailed his music as "excellent", and as "unmistakably a milestone on his road to the pinnacle that his father Ilayaraja has reached". Due to its successful run at the box office, the songs enjoyed popularity as well, particularly among the younger generation. The song "Oororam Puliyamaram" in particular was the Chartbuster number, also being chosen as the "Best Folk Song of the Year 2007" at the Isaiyaruvi Tamil Music Awards, whilst the entire album itself was named as "Isaiyaruvi Best Album of the Year 2007".

The film was dubbed into Telugu and released as "Malligadu" on 2 March 2012.

The film received overall positive critical response, particularly regarding the lead artists' performances. Sriram Iyer of "Rediff" gave the film three out of five stars, lauding it as a "remarkable effort" and claiming that Ameer "successfully brings alive the feel of the pastures". The reviewer appreciated the cast and crew, describing Karthi's performance as "excellent", while citing that Saravanan "excels" and Priyamani had done "a fairly good job in her deglamourised role". A "Behindwoods" critic wrote that "Paruthiveeran" "lives up to all that it promised and more". Heaping praise on the director, the reviewer further adds that Ameer had "shown his class again" and "enhance[d] his reputation as a master craftsman". Russell Edwards of "Variety" cited, "rough production values are mitigated by a myriad of sophisticated cinematic techniques that show this is no boondocks effort. Fests that appreciate curry flavors will eat this one up, though uninitiated aud[ience]s could experience culture shock". Furthermore, he noted that Ameer's "creative helming, which includes split-screen, appears unbridled and sometimes outright chaotic, but always serves the script", while writing that performances were "consistent with the bombastic storytelling". A reviewer from "nowrunning.com" called the film a "gripping tale narrated with a skill and imagination which only directors like Amir are endowed with", rating it three out of five.

Baradwaj Rangan called "Paruthiveeran" a "classic, one for the ages" and a "showcase for how good filmmaking can (almost) overcome mediocre material", while noting that Karthi gave "a superb first-film performance by any standard, and it makes you reach for that oldest of movie-myth cliches: A star is born." Other critics have offered criticism of the violence and brutality of some sequences in the film. A "Sify" critic wrote that it was "undoubtedly [...] a brave film and full credit goes to the director for making every scene realistic and characters life-like", while criticizing that Ameer's script was "too thin on logic" and the climax "too heavy, dark and morbid." However, in regards to the performances, the reviewer, too, heaped praise on the actors, describing Karthi as "spectacular" and Saravanan as "terrific" and adding that Priya Mani "... steals the show with her spontaneity and authenticity". Malathi Rangarajan of "The Hindu" claimed that the film was "the genuine depiction of village life" that "transports you to the era of classics in a rustic ambience, Bharatiraaja style", further citing that "all the same, when graphic pictures of gang rape and killing in cold blood dominate, things becomes too much to stomach" and that Ameer "only creates the impression that village folks as a whole are a belligerent lot."

Released on 23 February 2007, "Paruthiveeran" faced competition from "Mozhi", which was released on the same day. The film took a big opening at the Chennai box office, collecting 3.69 crore from 92 prints in Tamil Nadu in its opening weekend. The film continued to rank at first at the Chennai box office for five successive weeks, being ousted only by the Hollywood production "300" during the Easter weekend. At the end of its run, the film had reportedly grossed a share 15 crore at the box office, being declared one of the most commercially successful Tamil films of the year.

The film and many of its cast and crew have been awarded or nominated by many associations in India and worldwide for the film. Notably, Priyamani has won the Best Actress prizes at all awards ceremonies. "Paruthiveeran" was honoured with the "Special Mention" award from the Network for the Promotion of Asian Cinema (NETPAC) at the 58th Berlin International Film Festival. The film was screened five times at the Berlin Film Festival in two German subtitled versions and three English subtitled versions.

There was a controversy surrounding the ownership of the movie. Ameer has complained that the original producer K. E. Gnanavel Raja, couldn't finance the movie till its completion, so he supposedly gave up the movie to Ameer. But towards the completion of the movie, Ameer ran out of funds and the movie went back to Gnanavel. Since the release of the movie, both parties have been accusing each other for failing to make a payment which each owes from the other.

Baharon Ke Sapne

Baharon Ke Sapne (Dreams of Spring) is a 1967 Hindi film made under Nasir Hussain films' banner. It starred Rajesh Khanna and the Nasir Hussain fixture - Asha Parekh. It also had Premnath, Madan Puri and another Nasir Hussain fixture Rajendranath. Another pair of Hussain fixtures gave the music - Majrooh Sultanpuri the lyrics and composition by R.D. Burman. It is mostly a black-and-white film, except for one dream sequence: the song "Kya Janoo Sajan" was shot in color. In "Bahraon Ke Sapne", the response from the public in the first week of run forced the film's ending to be changed from a tragic one to happier one from the second week.


The film "Teesri Manzil" was originally supposed to be directed by Nasir Hussain and was to star Dev Anand in the lead. Another of Nasir Hussain's productions "Baharon Ke Sapne" was to be directed by Vijay Anand. However, on the occasion of Sadhana's engagement party, a misunderstanding erupted between Dev Anand and Nasir Hussain, when apparently, Nasir overheard Dev Anand saying "The film which Nasir is making with me is coloured and he has given Goldie some black-and-white film to make. Goldie is making the movie with some new boy, Rajesh Khanna". It was the next day that Nasir requested Vijay Anand to direct "Teesri Manzil" and offered to helm "Baharon Ke Sapne", but specified that "Teesri Manzil" would not have Dev Anand in it. It was only then that Shammi Kapoor was approached.

Ramaiya is very popular with his co-workers and they soon elect him as their new union leader. This puts Ramaiya in conflict with the Management of the Mill, headed by the owner, Kapoor, who has ordered that Ramaiya be eliminated post haste. But Ramaiya is determined to address the workers' grievances, and he gets himself framed for theft; has the police on the lookout for him, and so Ramaiya goes into hiding. When Ramaiya does not show up for a workers' meeting, some believe that he has been bought by the mill management, and they decide to take the matters into their own hands - by burning the mill down, killing Kapoor and his family, and getting into direct confrontation with the local police, who have been issued orders to shoot-at-sight.

The music for the movie was directed by R. D. Burman while the lyrics were written by Majrooh Sultanpuri.

Zamane Ko Dikhana Hai is a 1981 Indian Hindi film produced and directed by Nasir Hussain. The film stars Rishi Kapoor, Padmini Kolhapure, Amjad Khan, Yogeeta Bali, Kader Khan, Asrani,
Tariq Khan, and Simple Kapadia.

The film was Padmini's debut film as a lead actress. She had earlier worked as a child artist and as a supporting actress in "Insaaf Ka Tarazu".

The music, composed by Rahul Dev Burman with lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri, was successful, but the movie itself did not have the success associated with a Nasir Hussain production, with his last three films being major hits ("Hum Kisise Kum Naheen", "Yaadon Ki Baaraat" and "Caravan".)

The film took scenes from all previous Nasir Hussain productions and redid them as a part of the story, including the train top song (song being different) from his first production "Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai", the runaway girl from "Caravan" and the song contest from "Hum Kisise Kum Naheen".

Wealthy industrialist, Nanda, is enraged when he finds out that his eldest son, Ramesh, has fallen in love with a poor woman, Seema, and wants to marry her. He asks his son that if he marries her, he will exclude him from his will. In answer to that, Ramesh marries Seema and leaves the Nanda household. When Nanda's younger son, Ravi, returns home, he is told that his brother is away on business. Ravi does find out that Ramesh had been asked to leave by their father. He manages to convince his dad to change his mind about Ramesh, and sets off to find Ramesh. He finds out that Ramesh and Seema are no longer alive, but Seema had given birth to a son, and left him in the care of her sister, Kanchan. Ravi meets Kanchan, and both fall in love with each other. When Kanchan finds out that Ravi is Nanda's son, she is angry, and refuses to have to do anything with Ravi, as she is sure that she too will be rejected by Nanda, when he finds out that she is poor, and related to Seema. What Ravi and Kanchan don't know that Nanda has an ulterior motive, as he wants to adopt Ramesh's son - by hook or by crook.


The music was composed by Rahul Dev Burman, also known as R.D. Burman, with lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri.

The most well known song from the film is "Puchho Na Yaar Kya Hua" by Mohammad Rafi and Asha Bhosle. The melodious song was a major hit in India at the time.

In recent years, the soundtrack has received attention for "Dil Lena Khel Hai Dildar Ka," a synthesized, minimalist, electronic dance/disco song. It has been described as having "a very futuristic electro feel" and approaching a "techno wavelength." The song has been cited as a possible influence on the 1982 proto-acid house album "" by Charanjit Singh.

Notebook (2006 film)

Notebook is a 2006 Indian Malayalam-language teen film directed by Rosshan Andrrews and written by Bobby-Sanjay. It is about three students at a boarding school and how they face up to challenges in their lives. The film stars Maria Roy, Roma Asrani, Parvathy Thiruvothu, and Skanda Ashok; Suresh Gopi made a cameo appearance. The film dealt with the subject of teenage pregnancy.

The film was released on 15 December 2006. It received positive reviews and was also a commercial success at the box office. The film won the Kerala State Film Award for Second Best Film and Filmfare Award for Best Film – Malayalam.

The film is about the friendship of three girls: Sarah Elizabeth (Roma), Pooja Krishna (Parvathy) and Sridevi (Mariya Roy), all studying in 12th standard at Lord's Academy in Ooty. They come from different family backgrounds—Sairah from a broken home, with her separated parents (Aishwarya and Suresh Gopi), Sridevi, from a happy, close-knit family, with her parents (Sukanya and Prem Prakash) doting on her, and Pooja, a day scholar living near the school with her mother (Seetha), whom the trio depend on, when they have problem between themselves. But on other issues, they believe in solving the problems by themselves. Sreedevi falls in love with a schoolmate, Sooraj Menon (Skanda Ashok). Though hesitant at first, Sairah and Pooja approve their love after being convinced of Sooraj's sincerity.

During an excursion to Goa, Sreedevi and Sooraj have sex, and eventually she becomes pregnant, much to the shock of Sairah and Pooja, and moreover herself. They keep the news to themselves, fearing the sorrow and wrath of Sreedevi's parents; even Sooraj is kept in the dark, for fear that the news may leak out. They decide to go for an abortion in a small hospital near their school. During the Founder's Day celebrations at the school, the trio sneaks out of the campus, and reaches the hospital. Pooja keeps watch outside the hospital while Sarah and Sreedevi go in and they convince the gynecologist for an abortion by telling several lies, including that Sreedevi had been raped. During abortion, Sreedevi suffers excessive blood loss and dies. Sairah and Pooja flee the hospital in terror and return to school.

They are summoned to the principal's office the next day, and the doctor who came to the school as a part of an enquiry identifies Sairah. Sairah confesses that the rape story was a lie and Sreedevi actually had sex with somebody she loves, but she maintains she doesn't know who that is. Pooja, who considers her future as important, distances herself from the whole episode, leaving Sairah embarrassed and angry. The principal, who is concerned about the status of the school presses for not registering a police case, dismisses Sairah from the school. Pooja, now ashamed of and disturbed by what she did, tries to apologise to Sairah, but meets with hostility. Pooja loses her mental stability, unable to take the pressure of having lost two best friends together—one to death and the other to her own betrayal.

Years later, on Sairah's graduation day, she receives a letter that claims to be from Sreedevi. The letter informs her that Pooja was in a mental asylum for 6 years, and she needs Sairah's company. Sairah, returning to Ooty, finds out that Pooja has been discharged from the mental hospital. They realise how much they missed each other and return to their school campus to a tree they had planted years ago.


The filming was primarily held at Lawrence School, Lovedale, Ooty. The director Roshan Andrews says "Although it cost a fortune to shoot there, it turned out to be perfect. I had visited many schools in Kerala, but couldn't find what I wanted." The other filming locations were the Medical College Ground and the Indian Institute of Management in Kozhikode. The casting of the film was done through open calls. According to the director, the cast was selected from 5000 applicants. The film was produced by Grihalakshmi Films, a production house known for family dramas. The budget of the film was 18 million.

All the songs composed by debutant Mejo Joseph.

The film was released on 15 December 2006.

Reviewer from Sify, while complementing Andrews for taking up a taboo subject and casting newcomers, found the film unimpressive as a whole, and gave the verdict as "Ho-hum, just average". The Varnachitram.com review was generally positive, calling it an "interesting movie." However the reviewer felt that "[i]t takes the whole of the first half to reach the first plot point." He goes on to state that "[t]he line in the story would have read "Boy and Girl fall in love", but stretching it to the entire first half was, lets say a stretch." The reviewer lauded the direction and screenplay when the major theme of the film is dealt with. He also credited the director for "extracting great performances out of newcomers." The OneIndia.com review, though at first comments that "[t]here are times when you might feel as if the director is very obsessed with periods and pregnancy than the story itself", later adds that "the film's real theme seems to be something very relevant in today's changing times—the need for a strong family and support base."

Rediff.com review was generally negative. The reviewer felt that "[t]he single biggest handicap this film suffers from is the fact that none of the characters are real, believable." However, he adds that "[t]he bright spot is that the bunch of newcomers put in some exuberance into the otherwise turgid film." There was almost universal praise for the music of the film by debutant Mejo Joseph, who also plays a part in the film, and for the cinematography by C. Diwakar.
In an interviews the director Roshan Andrews revealed that "[s]even of Malayalam’s best known directors—Priyadarshan, Sathyan Anthikad, Sibi Malayil, Joshy, Jayaraj, Lal Jose and I. V. Sasi—saw the film and personally called [him] up and said it was not only good but was touching."

The film was made on a budget of 3.5 crore. The film had a slow start at the box-office, but collections gradually picked up. It gained a distributor's share of 3.8 million from 35 screens in the first week. The film completed 140 days theatrical run.

Michael Madana Kama Rajan

Michael Madana Kama Rajan is a 1990 Tamil language comedy film directed by Singeetam Srinivasa Rao and written by Kamal Haasan, with Crazy Mohan penning the dialogues.

The film also feature a large ensemble cast alongside Kamal Haasan, Urvasi, Rupini, Kushboo played the female leads, while Manorama, Delhi Ganesh, Nassar, Venniradai Moorthy, SN Lakshmi, Jayabharathi, R. N. Jayagopal, Nagesh, Praveen Kumar and Santhana Bharathi playing other significant roles. The film was a blockbuster and completed 175-day run at the box office.

The film tells a story of quadruplets, Michael, Mathanagopal, Kameshwaran, and Raju, all played by Kamal Haasan. Kamal distinguished each of those characters with his body language and language lingo. Michael has a husky voice and an aggressive demeanor, Mathana has a British accent with a sophisticated upper-class personality, Kameshwaran speaks Palakkad Tamil and has a naive, childish personality while Raju speaks Madras Tamil and has an outgoing, cheerful personality; all in keeping with their diverse upbringing as per the plot. The character played by actress Urvashi was well received by the audience and still considered as one of the best comic role played ever by a heroine. The film was dubbed in Telugu as "Michael Mathana Kama Raju".

Venugopal, a wealthy industrialist, marries a woman named Sushila and they have quadruplets. His brother Nandagopal tries to have her and the newborns killed by hired goons. However, the leader of the goons has no desire to kill the babies, so he adopts one (Michael), leaves one in an orphanage (Raju), one in a temple (Kameshwaran) who is picked by Palakkad Mani Iyer, a Brahmin, and one (Madhan) in a car that belongs to Venugopal.

30 years later, Madhan is now a London-educated businessman. Venugopal has raised Madhan as his adopted son, not knowing that he is his biological son. Venugopal is killed by Nandagopal and his nephew, Ramu for his inheritance, but unknown to them, the will has already named Madhan as the beneficiary. Madhan returns to Bangalore from England to take over his father's company. He confronts Avinashi, his father's assistant, over his embezzlement, while reluctantly promising to forgive him if Avinashi accepted his culpability.

Meanwhile, in Chennai, Michael, like his foster father, has become a petty criminal, and while escaping with his foster father from the police, accidentally causes a fire in an art gallery where artist Shalini's paintings are being displayed for exhibition. This brings in the firefighter, Raju, who saves Shalini and her paintings, leading to romance. Raju is also in debt to a money-lender over a failed stage play. While evading him, Kameshwaran is introduced as a cook for weddings and special events. He meets Thirupurasundari and her kleptomaniac grandmother. Eventually Kameshwaran marries Thirupurasundari.

Someone contacts Madhan over phone and tells him that his father's death was no accident, but that it was planned, and gives him an address in Chennai and a time to meet. After some distractions involving a woman named Chakkubai and her mother Gangubai, Madhan meets the caller, Sushila, who, unknown to him, is his biological mother. While escaping from goons sent by Ramu in a car, Madhan meets Raju, and hires him to impersonate him in Bangalore while Madhan investigates in Chennai. Meanwhile, Ramu and Nandagopal have hired Michael to kill Madhan. Michael sabotages Madhan's car, not realising it is Raju and not Madhan. The brakes fail on the highway, but Raju brings the car to a safe stop. Sushila meets with him thinking he is Madhan, but he redirects her to the real Madhan in Chennai. Raju, Shalini and her father arrive at Madhan's house in Bangalore. Raju confiscates Avinashi's money not knowing Madhan's deal with Avinashi.

Meanwhile, Michael finds the real Madhan in Chennai. Madhan and Chakkubai have fallen in love and Madhan presents her with a ring; unknown to them, they are being spied on by Michael and his foster father. Michael follows Madhan, Chakkubai, Gangubai and Sushila to Sushila's home where it is revealed that Madhan's father is alive but dazed from the assassination attempt. Michael and his foster father arrive at the scene. Sushila recognises the father as the person who had taken her quadruplets and realises that Michael and Madhan are both her biological sons. Michael and his father knock all of them unconscious and kidnap Madhan and the others to a mountain cabin near Bangalore.

Avinashi chances upon Kameshwaran on his wedding day, and hires him to impersonate Madhan to retrieve the money that Raju confiscated. Back in Madhan's house in Bangalore, Raju and Shalini plan to meet without her father knowing. Avinashi drugs Raju's soup but the soup is drunk by Madhan's bodyguard Bheem. Raju and Shalini meet and profess their love for one another. Michael and his father arrive at Madhan's house to loot it. Michael sees Raju, mistakes him for Madhan and thinks that Madhan has escaped from the cabin. He knocks Raju unconscious. Avinashi sees the unconscious Raju, assumes it was the effect of his drugged soup, and brings Kameshwaran into the house to retrieve his money. Kameshwaran is mistaken for Raju by Shalini who then tries to get intimate with him. Thirupu and her grandmother drag Kameshwaran away from her. Shalini then witnesses Kameshwaran hugging Thirupu. This enrages her as she thinks that Raju is two-timing her. To add to the hilarity, Chakkubai and Gangubai also arrive at the house in search of Madhan. Chakkubai mistakes Kameshwaran for Madhan and introduces herself to everyone as Madhan's fiancée, much to Avinashi's dismay, as his plan of using Kameshwaran to access Madhan's money keeps getting comically disrupted first by Raju's then by Madhan's girlfriend. Shalini takes a hunting rifle and holds everyone at gunpoint. Avinashi and the rest try to tell her that Kameshwaran is not Madhan/Raju but she does not believe them. Meanwhile, the real Madhan has escaped the cabin with his parents and comes to the house. In the midst of all this confusion, Michael steals Madhan's wealth and escapes to the cabin. The rest of the crew follows them back to the cabin in multiple cars.

Ramu and Nandagopal are already present in the cabin and hold everyone at gunpoint as they arrive one by one. All four brothers are finally in the same room at the same time and Sushila tells them that they are her quadruplets. The presence of all the people in the small cabin causes it to tilt over the cliff edge. The bad men are knocked out and the four brothers work together to safely get everyone out of the cabin. Everyone is happy as they are finally together.


According to Singeetham, "Michael Madana Kamarajan" is a "modern version of the old folk tale of king, queen and their quadruplets who grow up in different households." Kamal Haasan played four distinct characters who are quadruplets: the criminal Michael, the businessman Madhan, the cook Kameshwaran and the firefighter Raju. For portraying Michael, Haasan grew his hair long and sported a French beard; for Madhan, he wore glasses and was clean shaven; for Kameshwaran (also clean shaven), he brushed his hair back and applied a "vibhuti tilaka" on his forehead; for Raju, he kept his moustache thick and hair short. Praveen Kumar was cast as Madhan's bodyguard Bheem.

The song "Sundari Neeyum" was filmed entirely in slow-motion with 48 frames. Singeetham initially wanted the picturisation with 20 widows in background however he changed the idea after hearing the tune of the song. The climax sequence, featuring a "cliff-hanging-house", was based on a similar scene from the American film "The Gold Rush" (1925). The exterior portion was shot in Coonoor and the interior of the house was shot in studio, in a hydraulic set.

The soundtrack consists of five memorable songs composed by Ilayaraja. K. J. Yesudas was supposed to sing "Sundari Neeyum", but due to his busy schedule Ilaiyaraaja insisted on Kamal Hassan singing the song. "Rum Bum Bum" is yet another fast melody and is a huge hit in college setting till date. The soundtrack also had two songs "Mathapoovu Oru Penna" and "Aadi Pattam Thedi" which were not picturised.

The film was dubbed into Telugu with same title. Ilayaraja composed the music with Rajashri penning all the lyrics.

Singer Mahathi said, "I have always loved the ‘Crazy’ Mohan and Kamal Hassan combination. Especially in "Michael Madana Kamarajan" where Kamal brings out so much from every character, playing it so differently from the other."

Khoon Bhari Maang

Khoon Bhari Maang () is a 1988 Indian Hindi-language action thriller film released on 12 August 1988, directed and produced by Rakesh Roshan. It is a plagiarized copy of the Australian mini-series "Return to Eden" (1983), and stars Rekha as a wealthy widow who is almost killed by her husband and sets out for revenge. The film was a comeback venture for Rekha, and was a critical and commercial success. The film was remade in Telugu as "Gowthami", starring Suhasini and in Tamil as "Thendral Sudum" starring Radhika.

Aarti Verma (Rekha) is a widow with two children. She is an unattractive woman with a large birthmark on her face. Aarti's husband (Rakesh Roshan) died in a car accident under mysterious circumstances, and her father (Saeed Jaffrey) is one of the richest and most famous businessmen in the city. However, when Aarti's father is murdered by his worker Hiralal (Kader Khan), Aarti's world is completely destroyed. She does not find any sense for her life, except bringing up her children. Hiralal pretends to be a friend, and takes care of her like a father. He brings his poor nephew Sanjay (Kabir Bedi) from abroad, who is also the lover of Aarti's best friend Nandini (Sonu Walia). Although Nandini loves Aarti, she is intensely in love with Sanjay, and after he requests her to help him, she finally agrees to help him rob Aarti of her wealth. Slowly, Sanjay gets close to Aarti's children. Nandini and the rest of the family convince Aarti to marry Sanjay and finally, she marries him. The day after the wedding, Aarti, Sanjay and Nandini go on a short trip, in which Sanjay pushes Aarti from the rowboat into crocodile-infested waters, so that she dies, and he inherits her wealth. The crocodile mauls Aarti and mutilates her body and face. However, Aarti's body is not found and Sanjay cannot inherit the legacy until her body is found and her death is established beyond any doubt. As a result, the family is in a serious situation. Sanjay, out of frustration becomes abusive to the children and Aarti's pets. While all of this is occurring, Aarti is found adrift by an old farmer, who rescues her.

A few months later, the horribly disfigured Aarti decides to return to her city and avenge herself and her family. She exchanges her expensive diamond earrings for a huge amount of money, using the money to pay for extensive plastic surgery, and becomes a stunningly beautiful woman, very different from her earlier self. Aarti sets her first target Nandini who is the most successful model in town. In order to beat her popularity, she participates as a model in the same modelling agency (Kraft advertising agency) which made Nandini a star. Aarti Introduces herself as 'Jyoti'. The photographer JD (Shatrughan Sinha) spots her beauty and vows to make her the topmost model in the town even more successful than Nandini. Soon Jyoti's popularity takes over Nandini and out of frustration, she challenges Jyoti for a dance performance in which she loses. Nandini soon becomes jobless and Jyoti's first target gets settled. Meanwhile, Sanjay gets smitten by Jyoti's beauty and is no longer interested in Nandini. He tries various ways to woo her and seduce her but fails everytime. Later Jyoti finds out that her children have stopped going to school. Jyoti lures in Sanjay to invite her to her own home where she lived with her pets and children. Although the pets recognize Jyoti as Aarti, the children fail to do so. Jyoti finds out about all misdeeds of Sanjay and Hiralal through the children including the murder of Ramu Kaka, the servant (A K Hangal) and her father.

JD gets suspicious about Jyoti's actions and shows his concern for her. He offers help as a friend which Jyoti declines. JD ultimately finds out that Jyoti is none other than Aarti who has come back to exact revenge on her wrong doers. Meanwhile, Jyoti sets her second target, her uncle Hiralal, sneaks into his house at midnight and kills him. She then calls Nandini and tells her that she is taking Sanjay with him at Sitapur farm (the same place where Aarti was attacked). JD asks Aarti's children to tell about Jyoti's whereabouts as her life is in danger. He reveals them the secret about Jyoti being their mother. Sanjay brings Jyoti to the farmhouse. Nandini also reaches there and confronts Sanjay. She threatens to expose him to Jyoti and will not let her suffer like Aarti. Jyoti confronts them both and finally reveals herself as Aarti. Aarti vows to take revenge from Sanjay in the similar fashion the way he tried to kill her. Aarti fights Sanjay and in the process, Nandini sacrifices herself to save Aarti. Aarti with the help of her pet horse Raja, drags Sanjay to the same spot with Crocodile infested waters. Aarti tries her best to knock Sanjay off the cliff but Sanjay turns around and pushes her down.

JD reaches the spot, saves Aarti and fights Sanjay. After a brief fight, he knocks Sanjay out and he rolls down the cliff, hanging upside down. He asks Aarti for forgiveness. Aarti recalls that horrific incident when she was pushed into the lake and brutally attacked by the crocodile. Aarti knocks Sanjay one last time with a wooden rod and he falls down the cliff and gets devoured by the crocodile. Aarti reunites with her family and pets.


The film has four songs composed by Rajesh Roshan:

The song "Main Teri Hoon Jaanam" is lifted from the theme song of the British film "Chariots of Fire".

Reviews towards "Khoon Bhari Maang" were positive, with most of the critics' praise being directed towards Rekha's performance. In a 2000 article reviewing the last two decades in Hindi cinema, Bhawana Somaaya from "The Hindu" wrote: "Rakesh Roshan offers Rekha the role of a lifetime in "Khoon Bhari Maang"." M.L. Dhawan from "The Tribune", while documenting the famous Hindi films of 1988, argued: "With "Khoon Bhari Maang", Rakesh Roshan destroyed the myth that it was essential to have a hero as the protagonist and that heroines were there just to serve as interludes and mannenquins." Dhawan further noted: "This fast-paced movie was a crowning glory for Rekha, who rose like a phoenix in this remake of "Return to Eden", and bedazzled the audience with her daredevilry." Akshay Shah from Planet Bollywood wrote, "a perfect female oriented... [which] demands repeat viewing."

Heroes (2008 film)

Heroes is a 2008 Indian Hindi film directed by Samir Karnik and starring Mithun Chakraborty, Sunny Deol, Salman Khan, Bobby Deol, Preity Zinta, Sohail Khan, Vatsal Sheth and Dino Morea. The film is written by Aseem Arora. Although initially set to be released on 6 June 2008, it was pushed to 24 October 2008, the opening weekend of the holiday Diwali. On 22 November 2008 the script of "Heroes" was asked to be part of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Two film academy students, Ali (Vatsal Sheth) and Sameer (Sohail Khan), must make a movie in order to graduate. They choose to create a documentary illustrating reasons not to join the Indian Armed Forces, and go on a motorcycle road trip bearing three letters they have been given to deliver — each from a slain soldier to his family.

On their first stop, in Atari, Amritsar, they meet the widow, Kuljeet Kaur (Preity Zinta), and the son, Jassi (Dwij Yadav), of a Sikh soldier, Balkar Singh (Salman Khan), who was killed in action three years earlier. The students find that the entire village is very proud of the heroic officer and his sacrifice for the country. When they are flying kites, their kite is cut and it falls beyond a certain fence, in another field. Jassi tells them that the area beyond the fence is Pakistan, and the fence is the Border.

The students' second stop, Himachal, finds them meeting the Air Force pilot Vikram Shergill (Sunny Deol), who uses a wheelchair and whose Army officer brother, Dhananjay Shergill (Bobby Deol), had also been killed in action. Vikram is very proud of his brother's sacrifice. and he shows them how he has come to terms with his own grief.

The third letter is to be delivered to a Mr. and Mrs. Naqvi (played by Mithun Chakraborty and Prateeksha Lonkar), but their bike runs out of petrol, and they hitch a ride on a military convoy heading to a nearby base. They see soldiers' coffins in the truck, and the driver quotes an inspiring poem. At the base, they talk to the regiment commander and find another letter by Lt. Sahil Naqvi (Dino Morea) which they request to deliver themselves. They see that Mrs. Naqvi is busy in a tea party, hardly paying any attention. Sameer accuses her of not loving her son, and says that Sahil was a coward. Mrs. Naqvi plays them a tape which Sahil had recorded after he had saved another soldier's life. She tells him that she and her husband have been affected, and the parties serve as a distraction for them. They leave, but return the next day, and slowly bring the couple's life back to normal.

After completing their film, they reveal in a voice over that although they graduated, they did not go to America (as they had initially planned) because the trip has changed their outlook. They try to join the Army but fail, then start a school to share their experiences. Some years later, Sameer and Ali are walking around their School campus. A man in olive green uniform (Salman Khan) approaches them. This is revealed to be Jassi, the son of the first martyred army officer. Now a strapping young man, he has joined the army like his father, and will soon graduate from the IMA. The movie ends with the statement, "You don't have to be a soldier to love your country".

Originally titled "Mera Bharat Mahaan" (My India is Great), the film was rechristened "Heroes", to avoid sounding jingoistic.

Filming began on 15 June 2007. Salman and Preity are paired opposite each other, in their fifth film together. Shooting took place in Ladakh, Chandigarh, Punjab and Delhi. Some scenes were shot in Pangong Tso featuring Salman Khan, Sohail Khan and Vatsal Sheth.



















"Heroes" received generally positive reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the movie 3.5 stars out of 5.

According to "The Indian Express" the film does manage to say what it set out to; that pride keeps the families of the deceased soldiers going, civilians sleep peacefully only because soldiers give up their lives, and that a country survives only because it has brave soldiers guarding its borders. But it argues the director is too simplistic and that wringing emotion out of so many situations causes even the supreme sacrifice that the soldiers make turn trite. India Times movies give the movie 3 out of 5.

His father hatches a plan to teach him a lesson. He somehow convinces Raja to go his uncle's house in Dehra Doon for a holiday.

Nisha played by Kulraj Randhawa is a smart con girl, who has not only stolen diamonds worth Rs.100 crores ($25 million) from an exhibition but, has also double-crossed the boss of the most notorious gang. Now, she is on the run with the diamonds.
Destiny gets Raja and Nisha to meet in the most unexpected and bizarre circumstance. So when the smartest con girl and the biggest prankster meet, lots of fireworks are inevitable.

On the contrary, Radha loves another person, Raghu (Akash) who is an orphan and also jobless. Radha's father (Kota Srinivasa Rao) dislikes this; he lays a condition that he would agree for their marriage only if Raghu finds a job.

"Rediff" wrote "A brave film indeed for not resorting to the usual cliches and daring to go where very few filmmakers dare to go -- the ordinary realm of the despondency of the common man." "Sify" wrote "We wish Cheran had whipped up a more winsome screenplay with Mayakannadi, which is based on middle class dreams turning sour due to lack of commitment. It's nowhere in the league of the talented director?s previous works like Autograph or Thavamai Thavamirunthu." "Behindwoods" wrote "Mayakannadi is by no means a mediocre movie. But it certainly falls short of the high standards that Cheran has set for himself. It makes you think but fails to touch. That is the difference between just another movie and a great movie."

When Seth Durgadas steals some precious diamonds, one henchman turns traitor and decamps with the booty. The man is killed, but the diamonds are not found. A Victoria driver is wrongly sentenced to lifer since he was the last man to be seen with the dead man. Here, two crooks get the scent of the diamonds. The driver's daughter too is poised to prove her father's innocence. Durgadas's son Kumar too joins the forces after learning his true nature. Will this weird team find the diamonds? What surprises does everybody have in store for them?

Seth Durgadas is a rich businessman, revered by his son Kumar and society. In reality, Durgadas is the leader of a smuggling gang. As a trusted member of society, he gets all information, while his gang executes his plans. However, during one such robbery, a gang member turns greedy and flees with the diamonds. Durgadas sends another man to retrieve the diamonds and kill the traitor. The traitor is killed, but the killer too flees with the diamonds.

A furious Durgadas sends some henchmen to kill the traitor and retrieve the diamonds. The henchmen corner and kill the traitor, but the latter has succeeded in hiding the diamonds somewhere. Meanwhile, a Victoria driver of the eponymous Victoria, who was found near the dead body, is arrested based on circumstantial evidence. Somewhere else, two old golden-hearted crooks, Raja and Rana are to be released. Rana had an infant son who was kidnapped from a park. To date, Rana doesn't know who kidnapped him or whether his son is even alive.

The duo want to spend the rest of their lives as good, respected men. The plan is short lived when they find themselves on the trail of the diamonds. Soon, they learn about the Victoria and realise that no one has got a scent of the missing diamonds. To get closer to the Victoria, they pose as distant cousins of the Victoria driver, who are reluctantly admitted inside by the drivers elder daughter Rekha, who soon starts acting suspiciously.

During the day, Rekha rides the Victoria, posing as a man while during the night, when everyone is supposedly sleeping, she slips out of the home. One day, Raja and Rana follow her to the house of a man, who unknown to them, is Durgadas's henchman. They are shocked to see Rekha seducing him. But when the henchman tries to rape her, the duo save her. On accosting her, she tells that the man was loitering suspiciously near the Victoria when her father was arrested. Before they can know anything from him, he is shot dead.

On learning the Victoria drivers story, the duo decide to do one good turn. They tell Rekha the whole truth, but a shocked Rekha doesn't have a clue about the location of diamonds. Even after tearing the Victoria apart, nothing is found. Meanwhile, Rekha falls in love with Kumar, whom she met while posing as a cab driver. She tries to woo him posing as a rich lady, a plan which works well. However, Kumar learns the truth and decides to marry her, despite knowing about her father.

Kumar also meets Raja and Rana, whereupon he gets suspicious of the duo. Here, Durgadas objects to Kumar's relationship with Rekha. Later, Kumar learns of his father's true nature and leaves him. After meeting Rekha, Raja and Rana tell the truth to him too. The quartet decide to find the diamonds. Here, Durgadas kidnaps Rekha on learning that she is the daughter of the Victoria driver. Later, Kumar, Raja and Rana are also kidnapped and tortured.

During this deal, Durgadas's drinks are being served on an ornate tray with a fake Victoria headlamp attached to it. Suddenly, Rana realizes that the diamonds are hidden in the Victoria's lamp. He buys time for himself and his old buddy, and they go to retrieve the diamonds. The duo turn up at Durgadas's den, where they manage to create a confusion by luring the gang members to the diamonds. Durgadas is embarrassed to see that not one member of his gang is loyal to him.

During the melee, another twist occurs when an old henchman of Durgadas reveals that Kumar isn't Durgadas's son, but Rana's. Durgadas had ordered the henchman to steal somebody's child because Durgadas's father had threatened to disown him. Durgadas could have prevented the situation only by proving that Durgadas has fathered a child. In the end, Durgadas and his remaining cronies are arrested and Rekha's father is set free.

After being reunited with his son and his would be daughter-in-law, Rana decides to settle down. However, Raja decides that his destiny might have written something else for him and leaves. Soon, Raja spots a burkha clad woman and starts following her, only to find that the "woman" is actually Rana. Rana tells Raja that he will not let the latter spend the rest of his life without him. Raja relents and goes home with his friend.

Brahmachari (1968 Hindi film)

Brahmachari () is a 1968 Indian film. Written by Sachin Bhowmick, it is a G. P. and Ramesh Sippy production directed by Bhappi Sonie. The film stars Shammi Kapoor, Rajshree, Pran, Mumtaz, Jagdeep, Sachin and Asit Sen. The music was by Shankar Jaikishan. The film became a box office hit and won several awards, including Filmfare Best Movie Award.

It was later remade in Tamil as "Enga Mama" (1970) and in Telugu as "Devudu Mamayya" (1981).

Brahmachari (Shammi Kapoor), an orphan with no identity, takes care of many orphans in his home. Being poor, it is hard for him to take care of their every need.

One day he saves a young woman Sheetal (Rajshree) from committing suicide. She's in love with Ravi Khanna (Pran) who is promiscuous. Brahmachari promises to unite her with Ravi in return for money. Day and night he works on her appearance to make Ravi like her, but Brahmachari falls in love with her along the way. When Ravi proposes to Sheetal, she realises she loves Brahmachari. Ravi, however, brings in pressure on Brahmachari in terms of forfeiture of the mortgage on Brahmachari's house, due to non-repayment of loans. Ravi convinces Brahmachari into giving up Sheetal by promising to repay the mortgage dues in exchange, to which Brahmachari reluctantly agrees. In order to convince Sheetal, Brahmachari pretends to be romantically involved with Rupa. However, when Rupa tries to leave her newborn child at Brahmachari's house, Brahmachari finds out that the child's father is Ravi. He also gets hold of love letters written by Ravi to Rupa, which he intends to use to convince Ravi to marry Rupa. Ravi however doesn't relent and instead orders the kidnapping of Brahmachari's orphans. A fight ensues and the children are rescued. A repentant Ravi apologizes to Brahmachari and agrees to marry Rupa. Brahmachari and Sheetal get married and along with the children, set off on a road trip in Brahmachari's car.


Music scholar and film expert Rajesh Subramanian opines that the song "Aajkal Tere Mere Pyar Ke Charche" was a rejected tune, which a depressed Jaikishan played to Shammi Kapoor at Hotel Gaylord. Kapoor found the tune very catchy and suggested to director Bhappi Sonie to include the song in "Brahmachari". The song became one of the highlights of the film. Also the song "Aajkal Tere Mere Pyaar Ke Charche" , is usually thought to be sung by Lata Mangeshkar, but it was in fact sung by Suman Kalyanpur. (The confusion results from the fact that the quality of Suman Kalyanpur's voice is similar to Lata Mangeshkar's at times).

Milan (1967 film)

Milan is a 1967 Hindi film directed by Adurthi Subba Rao. It was a remake of his hit Telugu film "Mooga Manasulu" (1963) and was produced by L. V. Prasad. The film stars Sunil Dutt, Nutan, Jamuna (reprising her role from the original Telugu version), Pran and Deven Varma. The award-winning and very popular music was given by Laxmikant Pyarelal. It is among the earliest films to deal with the theme of reincarnation.

The movie starts with the marriage of Radha Devi and Gopinath (Nutan and Sunil Dutt). They start on their honeymoon and have to pass across a river on a ferry boat. While they are in the middle of the river, Gopinath suddenly begins to hallucinate about a whirlpool and shouts that they are going to die. Despite of the reassurances from Radha and the boatman, Gopinath couldn't be calmed, so Radha orders the boatman to take them to the nearby shore. Once they reach there, Gopinath starts to say things about Bibiji and a palace that should be there. Radha gets confused and follows him.

They meet with an old man who tells them that Bibiji and Gopi are long dead and their palace was now in ruins. Gopinath asks about Gowri, the shepherd girl. The old man tells them that she is still alive and would come daily to the graves of Gopi and Radha. While they are talking, an old lady comes there and Gopi recognizes her as Gowri. They go to her and she too recognizes them and tells them that they took rebirth to live together in this life. She starts to narrate their story.

Gopi was a poor orphan living with his grandmother in a village on the banks of Ganges. He carries passengers on his boat across the river for a living. Radha was a daughter of a zamindar and studies in the city college. Gopi carries her across the river and gives her a rose everyday. Radha finds his innocence lively and maintains a platonic relation with him. He teaches her a song which makes her the winner of singing competition in the college. Gowri (Jamuna), a shepherd girl has feelings for Gopi and always thinks that they are going to marry one day despite of Gopi's disinterest for her. Meanwhile, Rambabu (Deven Varma), Radha's classmate gets attracted to her and starts pursuing. He writes a letter to Radha expressing his love. Radha gets angry for that and sends Gopi to teach him a lesson. But her step mother finds that letter and thinks that Radha is also interested in Rambabu. She sends her brother and Radha's uncle (Pran) to settle this matter.

He meets with Rambabu and finds out that he is the heir of a very rich and respectable Roy family and he sincerely wants to marry Radha. He settles their marriage and Radha's parents feel happy about it. Meanwhile, Radha starts to acknowledge her feelings for Gopi and gets shocked to know that her parents settled her marriage with Rambabu. She tries to explain, but her father thinks that she was already in love with Rambabu and there is nothing to discuss. She goes to Gopi and tells him about her betrothal and he receives it passively. He indirectly indicates that whatever their feelings for each other are, class difference wouldn't allow any sort of relation between them. Radha accepts her fate and marries Rambabu and leaves her village.

As fate has different plans, she comes back to her father's house two months later as a widow. Everybody including her parents, uncle, Gopi and Gowri are shocked and feel bad to see her like that. Her father who was already ill, can't bear to see her in that condition and has a massive heart attack and loses his voice. Radha's uncle tries to molest Gowri, but Gopi comes between and saves her. This leads to acrimony between Gopi and him. Gopi continues to meet Radha to console her and to give her courage to live. But Gowri becomes irritated with their relation and fights loudly with Gopi regarding that. This leads to rumors in the village of Radha's affair with Gopi and Radha's mother gets disturbed. Even Radha's in-laws reject to give her share in their property as she was unfaithful to her husband.

At last these rumors reach Radha's ears and she goes to Gopi to talk about them. She gets surprised to see how Gopi made his little hut a temple for her. She realizes that he loved her dearly and asks him to elope with her. Gopi hesitates, but she tells him that she no longer cares about the society who has no sympathy for her. They start crossing the river and her uncle follows them with villagers. Gowri, feeling repentant for spreading rumors, offers her body to Radha's uncle in return for stopping the hunt. He agrees and stops the villagers, but a whirlpool takes Radha and Gopi in.

In the present day, Gowri feels happy to see them as a couple and dies in the hands of Gopinath.


The lyrics of the film were career-defining for Anand Bakshi and helped take him to the "top", with songs like "Sawan Ka Mahina Pawan Kare Sor", "Ram Kare Aisa Ho Jaaye" and "Bol Gori Bol". Music was composed by the duo Lakshmikant-Pyarelal who won their second Filmfare award for best music director for this movie. The playback singers were Lata Mangeshkar, who sang for Nutan and Mukesh, who sang for Sunil Dutt.

Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957 film)

Tumsa Nahin Dekha (English: "Saw nobody like you") is a 1957 Indian bollywood romance drama film, produced by Sashadhar Mukherjee while written and directed by Nasir Hussain, of Filmistan Pvt. Ltd. The film marked Hussain's evolution into a director. He had written films such as "Munimji" and "Paying Guest".

The film was conceived as a star vehicle for its heroine Ameeta, who was the protégée of Filmistan Studios owner Tolaram Jalan. Much care was taken with her make-up, wardrobe and lighting. Much of the film's extensive publicity was also built around the actress.

The film's huge success at the box office made the then-struggling Shammi Kapoor an overnight sensation instead. This was the film in which he developed his own individual look and youthful style, and was his first light-hearted musical and its success helped move him to acting in this genre. The film also stars the popular villain and character actor Pran. Its music is by O.P. Nayyar and lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri.

The film was originally offered to Dev Anand, but he declined, due to which Shammi Kapoor was cast. The film's original lyricist was Sahir, who wrote the title song, but he too opted out and Majrooh Sultanpuri took his place. [Interview by Shammi Kapoor to CNN IBN telecast after his death, on 15 August 2011]

Twenty years ago, after killing his friend, Sardar Rajpal flees from his hometown in Shillong and re-locates to the rural area of Assam along with his adopted daughter Meena. He asks his wife Kamla, to send their son Shankar, so that he can employ him and get him married to Meena. Shankar arrives and he is welcomed by Sardar, who employs him and introduces him to Meena. A few days later, another young man shows up at his door claiming to be Kamla's son. A baffled Sardar also welcomes him, and puts both the young men under observation in order to find who the real Shankar is. The question remains: why would anyone want to impersonate Shankar, and what will happen to Sardar himself after the Police catch up with him for killing his friend 20 years ago?

The Songs "Jaiye Aap Kahan Jayenge", "Yeh Hai Reshmi Zulfon Ka Andhera", "Pukarta Chala Hoon Main" and "Humdum Mere Maan Bhi Jao" are milestones in Hindi film music.

This film is the unofficial remake of "Come September", which is a 1961 romantic comedy film directed by Robert Mulligan, starring Rock Hudson, Gina Lollobrigida, Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin.

Neena (Asha Parekh) is on an excursion trip to Kashmir, in the company of her mother Savitri Devi (Achala Sachdev), who is also the warden of their girls hostel in Lucknow and several female friends. During their journey, they decide to stay overnight at the Dreamland Hotel. Another lodger, Kumar (Biswajit Chatterjee), who arrives there subsequently, finds their presence undesirable and asks the caretaker to get the surprised group to leave, as he is perturbed by the fact that his residential bungalow has been converted into the Dreamland Hotel! The caretaker, Shyam (Pran) explains to the girls that Kumar is mentally unstable and under the impression that he is the owner of the hotel, as Shyam is involved in illegal activities there, for which he had converted the bungalow into a vice den.

Kumar is the heir apparent to his uncle, Mr. Mehra's (Nazir Hussain) industrial empire and cotton mills as his father and Mr. Mehra were the best of friends. Mr. Mehra had relocated to Africa for business, leaving his 2-year-old daughter and his wife in her paternal home, subsequent to which came Partition of India, which displaced his family.

Meanwhile, during the trip itself, Shyam discovers through his servant, who had previously served under Mr. Mehra, that Savitri Devi is the lost wife of Mr. Mehra and Neena their daughter and thus true heir. He thus tries to cultivate both mother and daughter in the hope of usurping Mr. Mehra's wealth.

After several misunderstandings and altercation with goons at the nightclub of the hotel, because of Neena, Kumar and Neena fall in love and express their desire to get married, to Mr. Mehra, who disapproves.

Subsequently, Neena and her mother are given some intimate photographs of Kumar and Kamo by Kamo, alias Kamini (Mumtaz (actress)), who has been paid by Shyam to do so. But her greed makes her blackmail Shyam to give her more money to keep these secrets, whereupon he gets her killed. Kumar, to prove his innocence, barges into Kamini's room to find her dead, and is thus framed for her murder by eyewitnesses who see him there!

Savitri devi is united with her husband, on a chance meeting, but Neena has already left with her friend Pyarelal (Rajendra Nath), who enlightens her about her true father, Shyam's bad intentions for her, and Kumar's innocence in Kamo's murder. Both of them chance to hear Shyam plotting to get Kumar shot at the beat of cymbals, to be killed during a dance performance at the International club. Pyare silences the real dancer and replaces Neena with her and thus they are able to save Kumar from an untimely ghastly death. But Shyam grabs hold of Neena and escapes in his car to his hide out. He is chased by Kumar and overpowered there, along with the timely arrival of the police, thus resulting in a happy ending of the real family uniting together.


The soundtrack is composed by O.P. Nayyar, while the lyrics are penned by lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri. The soundtrack consists of 9 songs. Singers such as Mohammad Rafi and Asha Bhosle have done the playback for the songs of the album. Songs such as "Pukarta Chala Hoon Main", "Jaiye Aap Kahan Jayenge" and "Yeh Hai Reshmi Zulfon Ka Andhera" are still considered to be classics, while the others songs are also popular. There is also a small alap, which Mohammed Rafi takes in the beginning of the song "Jaiye Aap Kahan Jayenge".

Main Azaad Hoon

Main Azaad Hoon () is a 1989 vigilante thriller drama Hindi film, an Indian adaptation of the 1941 Frank Capra film, "Meet John Doe", by Javed Akhtar, about an opportunistic journalist who concocts a fictitious man in a fictitious article to boost newspaper sales, but when the article gets a huge response, she finds an unemployed man to sit in as Azaad, "man of the masses". The film was directed by Tinnu Anand, and starred Amitabh Bachchan and Shabana Azmi. This film is remade in Telugu as Azad (2000 film)& tamil as Velayudham. 

The film was a Disaster at the box office and is the lowest grossing Amitabh film of the 1980s,even lower than the then lowest Jaadugar released in the same year. 
The film has only one song; "Itne Baazu Itne Sar", written by Shabana Azmi's real life father and noted poet Kaifi Azmi and sung by the lead actor himself, Amitabh Bachchan.

The film won the Filmfare Award for Best Dialogue for Javed Akhtar.

The movie begins with a female journalist named Subhashini (Shabana Azmi) working for a daily newspaper in a city named Rajnagar. She is deemed controversial due to her bold and open-mouthed articles against corrupt politicians.

After a change in the ownership of the newspaper, she realises that she stands to lose her job along with many others, especially who are not likely to subscribe to the new management's policies. Feeling betrayed, she vents her frustration by penning her column with a fictitious letter "ad verbatim", which is supposedly written to her by someone named Azaad. This letter openly criticises the establishment and the chasm that exists between the haves and the have-nots, vocalising unacknowledged and uncomfortable facts. The letter also says that the author of the letter would commit suicide from a high-rise building on 26 January, the Republic Day of India, as a mark of protest against a failed system. The letter creates a sensation among political leaders, businessmen and the public.

In this new development, the new owner, Seth Gokulchand (Manohar Singh), senses an opportunity. He thinks of a scheme to promote his newspaper and coaxes Subhashini to establish a column in the name of Azaad and write about the ills of the present society and administration. The task for them now is to find a face and character for Azaad, should the question arise about the real identity of the author of the column and the letter.

One day, she comes across a jobless and nameless vaudevillian character, Amitabh Bachchan), who happens to be drifting by Rajnagar along with another bum friend of his. Subhashini offers him a job asking him to pose as Azaad. He sees a chance in it to make a few quick bucks. With this in mind, and that he has nothing to lose, he accepts the job. Subhashini makes use of the whole propaganda machinery at her disposal to create a public figure for Azaad. Azaad is steadily introduced in the media and local issues and made to attend various public rallies. His native, down to the earth charm finds instantaneous appeal with the people of the town. This draws the gullible public to his frequent public addresses. Word spreads like wildfire and soon people from the surrounding rural areas flock in to attend his public appearances. This gathers momentum and soon Azaad becomes a cult figure. Gokulchand initiates the idea of making Azaad a much wider-publicised figure to Subhashini. She very efficiently works on the idea writing articles on Azaad, on Azaad's ideas. This results in Azaad becoming a kind of a nationwide hero, and is soon perceived as a threat by the local politicians as a potential national leader.

Later he learns through the media that he has been used, however he decides to sacrifice for the nation and prove that he now identifies with the ideology of the imaginary character Azaad. To prove that what had begun as fiction, has now become the truth, he jumps from the 30-story under-construction building and dies. But before that, he records a message for his supporters and urges that Azaad should evolve in each one of them.

Namdev goes on the run, but Raghu and Damu intervene and throw him over a bridge into a river. Namdev is presumed dead.

However, he is rescued by Don (Amrish Puri), and no one is aware he is alive.

Twenty years later, Damu and Raghu have used their stolen lottery money to build a fabulous hotel and make millions, becoming very successful businessmen. Damu has used a share of his money to send his youngest son, Vicky (Shatrughan Sinha), to school in England. They have even employed Namdev's oldest son Johnny (Amitabh Bachchan), Vicky's best friend, as a waiter in the hotel. By coincidence (or by fate!) Johnny and Vicky fall in love with the same beautiful singer, Miss Asha (Hema Malini). Julie (Reena Roy) is a childhood friend of Vicky's who is in love with him, but he only sees her as a friend. When Johnny discovers this, he and Julie sacrifice their own love to ensure that Vicky and Asha get together. At the same time, Johny's younger brother Sunny (Rishi Kapoor) has fallen for Asha's younger sister, Kim (Kim). Kim and Asha happen to be the daughters of Jaggi, the man Namdev supposedly murdered. Namdev returns soon after and plans to take revenge against Damu and Raghu for separating him from his sons Johnny and Sunny. The lives of all these characters become intertwined and "Naseeb" becomes a poignant story about love, friendship, sacrifice, deceit, revenge and, above all, destiny.

One of the songs in the film sung by Mohammed Rafi, "John Johny Janardan", has cameo appearances by many actors playing themselves.

He is intelligent but spends his time idly playing with the neighbour's kids. His older brother gets into an accident at work at the mill and loses his arms. He loses his job and needs money for treatment. Kaalia begs his brother's boss, Shahani Seth (Amjad Khan), but he refuses. Kaalia breaks into Shahani's safe to get the money, but it's too late as the brother dies. Shahani throws Kaalia in jail for nine months. This is where he meets the men that teach him crime (kallu se kalia ka safar shuro hota hai). After his release, Kaalia is a different, stronger man. He and his accomplices steal the gold that the boss had been smuggling at the mill. Then he burns down the mill as retribution for his brother's death. He goes to jail again, this time for two years. His accomplices lie to his sister-in-law by telling her that he is in America earning a lot of money for her and her daughter. They move from poverty to riches. In jail, Kaalia meets the jailor (Pran), a smart, ethical, strong man, whose daughter was kidnapped by one of the prisoners when she was little. After Kaalia is released from prison, he is bent on seeking vengeance and eventually pairs up with a woman (Parveen Babi). The boss kidnaps Kaalia's niece and forces her mother to testify against Kaalia in a murder trial. He is found guilty for a murder he didn't commit and escapes from prison to find his niece. At first, the warden chases him and once he knows the true story, decides to help him. They go to the boss's place and not only find the little girl, but also the sister-in-law about to die. The boss reveals to the warden that he was the one who had kidnapped his daughter 20 years ago and now it's the grown up Parveen Babi's character. They fight with him, the boss gets beaten up badly and Kaalia finally chops off Shahani's arm off. Everyone lives happily ever after.

For a dance show she arrives at Mumbai with her troupe and is robbed of her purse by a pickpocket. Raju retrieves her purse only to steal her expensive necklace. Kamini's uncle owes 1 million rupees to another criminal, Ranjeet. In order to pay his debt he advises Ranjeet to marry Kamini, so that he can inherit her wealth worth 5 million. Kamini runs away from her home. In order to trace her, Ranjeet advertises in a newspaper that Kamini has run away from home with jewellery worth 1 million. Raju is the first one to trace her and entices her to an isolated bungalow. Here, Kamini confesses her love for Raju, but he is indifferent and pretends to love her in return. He secretly checks all her baggage for jewellery and is disappointed to find that she has none. Shankar is able to trace Raju and trades Kamini for 10,000. Kamini is heartbroken with the reality. Ranjeet pays off Shankar for Kamini, while Kamini slips past his custody just in time. Coincidentally, she seeks shelter at Shankar's home and Roma comes to know everything about Shankar. She is shocked and tries to commit suicide. Shankar assumes that she has committed suicide, but is saved by Raju in the nick of time and takes her home. Since she is pregnant, the doctor advises her to rest. Shankar is heartbroken and vows give up all his criminal activities. He also gives shelter to Kamini and keeps her at his home. Kamini respects Shankar for his gesture and treats him like an elder brother. He returns the money to Ranjeet, which infuriates him and he wants revenge. Meanwhile, Kamini has a change of heart towards Raju when she learns that Raju has given up his pickpocketing and wants to lead a dignified life with her. Ranjeet decides to use Raju as a pawn to exact revenge. Through Raju, he manages to get Shankar arrested in an attempt to smuggle gold (his old commitment and final job), but Shankar somehow manages to hide the gold before being arrested. In order to create a rift between Kamini and Raju, he tells her that Raju got Shankar arrested. Kamini straight away goes to his home to find the truth and comes across Roma and her newborn baby. Kamini tells Roma that Shankar is truly sorry for his acts and has given up all his criminal activities. Kamini inform Shankar that Roma is alive and has their baby. Ranjeet manages to kidnap Kamini and desires to marry her. Kamini reveals that she has not inherited any wealth and her uncle was lying to him. Ranjeet then plans to trade her with Shankar for the smuggled gold. Shankar escapes the prison to see his wife. He encounters Raju and Raju is able to nab him and tie him up. Raju trades Shankar for Kamini and returns home with the purse he had pocketed of Shankar. At home, when he checks the contents he comes to know that Shankar is his long lost brother and goes to save Shankar.

Dushman (1971 film)

Dushman (English: "Enemy") is a 1971 Hindi film produced by Premji and directed by Dulal Guha. It is based on a novel by Virendra Sharma. The film stars Rajesh Khanna in the title role and for which he received a Filmfare nomination as Best Actor, the only nomination for the film.
Meena Kumari, Mumtaz, Bindu, Rehman, Asit Sen and Johnny Walker are part of the cast.

The film became a "super-hit" at the box office and stood 3rd in top ten list. The 2012 review of the film by the newspaper "The Hindu" stated: "Essaying the role of Surjit Singh, a reckless, macho truck driver, with a penchant for consuming desi liquor and visiting brothels, the actor can be described in only one word — superb. Wearing fatigues for most of the film and donning a moustache, Khanna looks every bit the truck driver he portrays. He adapts to the role, discarding his trademark mannerism and style of dialogue delivery for a sprightly walk and body language that smacks of arrogance."

This film was remade in Tamil as "Needhi" in 1972, starring Sivaji Ganesan and Jayalalithaa.
The film was later remade into the Telugu film "Khaidii Babay" (1974), starring Shobhan Babu in the title role, and Vanisri as his love interest. Also was remade in Malayalam as Maattoly starring M. G. Soman. It was also remade in Kannada by Shankar Nag as "Hosa Theerpu" (1983) starring Ambareesh.

Surjit Singh (Rajesh Khanna) earns livelihood by driving truck. He is a rash driver often driving after drinking. One night he stops at the prostitute Chamelibai's (Bindu), spends the night with her, and gets up late the next morning. He rushes out and drives at breakneck speed in thick fog to make up for the lost time while again drinking. He ends up running over and killing a farmer named Ram Din. But despite the opportunity to run, he decides to stay and face the consequences. He is arrested by the police, charged, and brought before the court.

Surjit acknowledges his guilt to the Judge (Rehman), who in turn knows that he should send Surjit to prison for two years. But moved by the plight of Ram Din's family (which include his widow Malti (Meena Kumari); his sister Kamla (Naaz); two young sons; a crippled father Ganga Din (Nana Palsikar), and his blind mother (Leela Mishra), and his inherent belief that imprisonment does not serve the good for victim or the perpetrator, the Judge resolves to try a novel experiment of forcing Surjit to live with Ram Din's family and look after their financial needs. A horrified Surjit attempts in vain to convince the Judge to change his ruling. He is transported to his new "prison" under police protection, where he is met by hostile villagers. Ram Din's family detest his presence, and call him "Dushman" (The enemy). Surjit attempts to escape on the first night, but is apprehended and brought back to serve his time.

He gradually comes to terms with the twist of the fate that has forced him to become a farmer for subsistence and live under the ever unforgiving eyes of Ram Din's family. Over time, he starts sincerely working for the family and its interests. He meets Phoolmati (Mumtaz), a happy-go-lucky girl who operates a small bioscope machine to entertain the village kids. They take an instant liking to each other, which blossoms into love. He also finds friends amongst the previously hostile villagers. He works hard on the family plot while also protecting it from the clutches of a local landlord, who has ill-intentioned designs on the land and also on Kamla.

Surmounting many obstacles, Surjit is able to arrange the marriage of Kamla with her childhood sweetheart. With the help of a benevolent police force and the Judge, he is also able to thwart the many attempts of the landlord to seize the family's land, and that of other villagers who have mortgaged their land with the same landlord. Malti however, is unable to forgive Surjit for having killed her husband.

Things take a dramatic turn for the worse when Surjit is framed and arrested for the accidental death of Phoolmati's drunk grandfather. At the same time, the landlord covertly gets the harvest produced by Surjit and other villagers, on fire, and has Phoolmati kidnapped, primarily to punish Surjit. Malti, who has been working in one of the landlord's saw mills thinking he is an honourable man, witnesses his misdeeds, and finally realises her mistake. She is able to rescue Phoolmati, but gets trapped by the landlord instead, who attempts to rape her. Meanwhile, Surjit stages an escape from his holding cell and with the help of Phoolmati, is able to come to Malti's rescue in the nick of time. He confronts the landlord and violently assaults him as payback. The police show up and arrest the landlord for his role in defrauding the villagers and destroying their harvest.

Ram Din's family finally accept Surjit as one of their own, and arrange his marriage to Phoolmati. In a final twist though, his two years' imprisonment is complete, and the Police arrive to escort him back to town. He pleads with the Judge to let him serve a life sentence, and the Judge smiles, vindicated that his experiment has been successful.

The music is by Kalyanji Anandji. The movie was remade in Kannada as "Anukoolakkobba Ganda". This movie was among the top 10 movies searched online of Khanna as of 2012. The pair of Nanda and Khanna had worked in the thriller "The Train" and the suspense drama "Ittefaq" (1969). This was the pair's third box office hit.

Kalpana (Nanda) is the daughter of a rich man who always worries that his daughter might fall in love. Hence, he always forbids her to talk with men. But Kalpana does not care. She leaves for her uncle's house to continue her studies. In the city, Kalpana visits an art gallery and gets attracted by a painting of an artist named Rajesh (Rajesh Khanna). She gets angry when a photographer tries to get a sketch of her without her consent. Meanwhile, an aspiring artist is working on an assignment for an ad for the company where Kalpana's uncle works. Due to the deadline pressure, he sketches Kalpana for the ad without her knowledge as he was not satisfied with the models he saw. The next day Kalpana's picture gets published in newspaper and Kalpana gets angry about that. She finds that the sketch was done by the artist Rajesh and her anger goes away. Both of them become good friends and then eventually fall in love. Kalpana's father comes to know about this and he lies to her that Kalpana's mother is ill. Kalpana rushes to her home, only to find it was her father's lie as he does not want his daughter to be away anymore. He arranges for Kalpana's marriage with a son of rich man who looks like an elephant. Kalpana runs away to Rajesh and insists that he marry her. Rajesh initially refuses as his financial background is not stable, but finally agrees under Kalpana's compulsion. Both marry and settle with their lives.

Rajesh tells Kalpana that they should go to Kalpana's father and apologize for whatever happened, much against liking of Kalpana. Unwillingly, she goes to her father. She tells him to wait outside and she alone goes inside her home. Kalpana's father insults Rajesh badly and says that he is looking only for the money and property of Kalpana. She gets angry and leaves the place along with Rajesh. But Kalpana stays in touch with her mother through letters. She writes to her mother that Rajesh is now rich and bought a bungalow, car etc. so as to irritate her father. Kalpana and Rajesh are blessed with a boy and Kalpana's father changes his mind to see his grandson. He informs Kalpana about their arrival for the naming ceremony of the child. Now Kalpana is in trouble as she has lied to her parents about Rajesh's wealth and growth, which is not known even to Rajesh.

She hires a bungalow and car for two days until the departure of her parents. Rajesh tries to refrain her from lying and when she refuses to listen to him, he angrily tells her that she should hire a husband too, if she could hire a house and car and leaves. Kalpana, confused and tensed, asks her friend's brother to play the role of her husband for two days and he hesitantly agrees. Kaplana's parents buy everything, though they feel things are bit chaotic. They attribute it to the inexperience of their daughter and lack of domestic help. On the other side, Rajesh feels quite ashamed of leaving his wife like that and comes back. When he comes to know of the arrangements, he settles there as domestic help.

Now, the comedy of errors revolves around the bungalow for the next two days with Kalpana, Rajesh and Kalpana's fake husband, who is about to marry Kalpana's other friend within two days. Things go normally till two days later, when Kalpana's parents announce that they want to continue the stay to spend more time with their grand-kid and make him their heir. Their landlord, and people who gave the car and furniture on rent come to take them back. Moreover, Kalpana's cousin who expected that he would inherit property becomes bitter and kidnaps the child. After Rajesh saves his child and his father-in-law's money, the drama gets unveiled. Finally Kalpana's parents buy house, car and furniture and ask forgiveness for not understanding Rajesh's character before, and finally things come to order.

Anand takes it personally and walks out. On the way back home he sees an Indian Army poster. Eager as he is to get a job, he quickly enrolls, much to the displeasure of his mother. Meeta, not knowing what has happened between her father and Anand, visits his home and comes to know that Anand has left to serve in the Army. She tells his mother that, being her future daughter-in-law, she will stay with Anand's mother. Meeta makes sure that Anand does not come to know about her presence at his home and takes care of his mother.

Meanwhile, Anand gets trained and is posted in a war zone. At his camp, Anand befriends Major Verma (also Dev Anand), a man who looks just like him (except that he has a moustache). With time, a bond develops between the two. The Major tells Anand about his personal life, his wife Ruma (Nanda) and his mother. As fate would have it, Major Verma goes missing in the war, and is presumed dead. A telegram is sent to his family saying that they are unable to trace him.

On the other hand, Anand gets promoted for his heroic acts. He returns home to find Meeta there and learns of his mother's death. Anand envisions what Verma's family must be going through in his absence. He decides to break the news of the Major's death personally and visits their home. Upon seeing him, the Major's mother mistakes him for her son and hugs him. Ruma too is overjoyed. Anand tells the family doctor of his true identity, but the doctor advises Anand against telling Ruma the truth since Ruma suffers from heart disease and cannot bear emotional stress. To keep Ruma happy and stress-free, Anand has no choice but to play the part of Major Verma, and starts spending more and more time at Verma's home. Meeta grows unhappy about Anand's continuous absence from home. Once, when she sees him at a temple with Ruma, she concludes that he is having an affair and leaves him.

At the same time, Anand is not comfortable with being close to Ruma. This pains Ruma and she asks him why he is so distant from her, and when they would have a child. Anand replies that the war has changed him and he would never have a child with her. However, Ruma starts to think that Major Verma no longer loves her and is having an extra-marital affair.

It is now revealed that the Major is alive, though he has lost a leg. He reaches home and finds Anand in his place. He misjudges him and believes that he is taking sexual advantage of Ruma. Major Verma ambushes Anand on a secluded street and tries to kill him. A scuffle ensues, and the attempt to shoot Anand fails. Anand explains that he is merely playing his part to keep Verma's family happy and his wife healthy. To convince the Major, Anand tells him to come to the temple the next day. He also communicates the same to Meeta.

The next day, Anand comes to the temple with Ruma. As Major Verma and Meeta secretly listen on, Ruma again complains to Anand about the lack of physical intimacy between them. Anand then asks her whether she would leave her husband if he were to become handicapped. Ruma's answer is an emphatic no.

At this point, the real Major Verma reveals himself and Ruma hugs him. Meeta too understands the situation and reconciles with Anand. The two couples leave the temple and the film ends on a happy note.


Music composed by Jaidev and lyrics by Sahir Ludhianvi.

Through the story of the two couples (Meeta and Anand, and Ruma and Major Verma), the movie depicts how insecurity can affect romantic relationships. Another theme touched upon is war, and its impact on the people's lives.

The film has two superhit songs "Mai Zindagi ka saath nibhata chala gaya" and "kabhi khud pe, kabhi halat pe" by Mohammed Rafi and the Lata solo "Allah tero naam". It also has the evergreen duet "Abhi na jaao chhodkar" by Mohammad Rafi and Asha Bhosle.

It is directed by Ravikant Nagaich, and it stars Rajesh Khanna, Tanuja, Sujit Kumar, Bindu, Helen, Utpal Dutt, Nazir Hussain and Rajindranath. It was the second movie of Rajesh Khanna with Tanuja after the blockbuster "Haathi Mere Saathi" (1971). The movie was a big flop upon its release and was the 22nd-highest grosser of the year. Although being a box-office flop it received good and average reviews from viewers and critics and the soundtrack and songs became very popular and are still excellent. "O mere Dil ke chain" and "Chala Jata hoon" are still very famous melodies from this film.

Prakash (Rajesh Khanna) is a son of a rich father (K. N. Singh) who wants to become an artist. His father challenges him to earn one time meal from his profession. He accepts the challenge and leaves his father's house. He tries to sell his artistic paintings but fails. Princess Kamini (Helen) a playgirl introduces him to glamour world and he changes his painting style to modern demands. At heart he remains altruistic person. Jyoti (Tanuja) An eye doctor arrives in Bombay from London. Prakash though a gifted painter but now a playboy falls in love with her. They become lovers. His past creates problems for him. Kamini turns up at Prakash's house drunk and whilst she was flirting with him, Jyoti arrives and finds them together, she storms off. Prakash insults Kamini and asks her to leave. Dejected Jyoti spurns his attempts to reconcile initially, but when he feigns a suicide attempt by supposedly taking poison and being told the reality of Kamini she reconciles. He proposes to marry her. Jyoti's father (Nazir Hussain) visits Prakash with a bribe and is disgusted with his paintings of the female form and rejects him. However, after seeing Prakash's altruism, he apologizes and they start planning the wedding.

Prakash has a car accident and Kamini finds him and takes him back to her palace. He becomes her prisoner. Jyoti receives a telegram informing her of Prakash's death. Jyoti and her father mourn his death. The bandages on Prakash's face are removed and he discovers that he is blind. She whips and hits him during captivity and vows to behead him. Jyoti is wooed by Captain Vinod (Sujit Kumar), who buys her gifts and says the same lines as Prakash had said. All these reminds her of Prakash. To win his heart Kamini takes Prakash to horse riding from where he escapes. He hides behind a rock, and in "hunting" him, Kamini falls off the mountain and dies. He makes his way to the road and is eventually picked up by Captain Vinod, who takes Prakash to his father's house, where he learns that his father died a month ago and now has a new occupant. Captain Vinod takes Prakash to his family home where he and his family nurtures him and allows him to recuperate. Captain Vinod goes to the hospital and asks Jyoti to visit his family home, where he has a friend in need of eye care. Before she can see Prakash, she leaves in a taxi after Vinod's parents pressure her to become their future daughter-in-law. She arrives home and discovers her father has a heart attack and overhears her father saying of his desire for his daughter to marry. She agrees to marry Captain Vinod and the engagement party ensues. Prakash attends the celebration, where he is requested to sing. Jyoti sees him performing and starts crying in the distance.

Later, Vinod rings Jyoti and informs him that he is sending his friend to her eye hospital. Prakash and Jyoti reconcile, and Prakash undergoes eye surgery operated by her. While recuperating, Captain Vinod overhears them in the garden and Prakash stating that he wants to love her not as an invalid, but as a normal man. Both men become tormented, Vinod that he has lost the game of love, and Prakash that he doesn't want to ruin Vinod's happiness, for all that he has done for him. Despite Prakash vowing to leave, Vinod beats up Prakash, and Jyoti arrives and witnesses it. A fight ensues, and just as Vinod is about to kill Prakash, his father (Utpal Dutt) shoots him in the leg. Prakash and Jyoti marry.


Jerry Pinto says of the film that "Helen's cinematic seniority to the hero, Rajesh Khanna, added an edge to her pursuit of him." David J. Weiner described "Mere Jeevan Saathi" as "a bizarre, unclassifiable Indian film with music, fantasy, special effects, violence, and flamboyant mise-en-scene." The 2013 review by "The Hindu" newspaper said: "You could watch the movie for some superb music as only R.D. Burman could have conjured and delivered, film after film, especially if it involved the irrepressible Rajesh Khanna." A religious number, "Apno Ko Kab Hey Ram" and the playful "Chala Jata Hoon Kisi Ki Dhun Mein" strike different notes to prove the versatility of Kishore Kumar, who is at his liveliest in "O Mere Dil Ke Chain" and "Diwana Kar Ke Chodoge" with Lata Mangeshkar. It was a movie that went well with the masses. It commands plenty of nostalgic appeal even in present times.

The music was composed by R.D. Burman and lyrics were by Majrooh Sultanpuri. The soundtrack by R.D. Burman continues to be popular even today. "O Mere Dil Ke Chain", "Diwana Leke Aaya Hai" and "Chala Jaata Hoon" are still very popular.
It's said that R.D. Burman was haunted by the tune of "Chala Jaata Hoon" in his dreams. Rajesh Khanna initially did not approve "O Mere Dil Ke Chain", but when director Ravikant Nagaich told R.D. Burman, he went with the harmonium in Rajesh Khanna's room and came back after 15 minutes saying Khanna had approved the tune.

The film was later remade into the Telugu film "Sivamettina Satyam" (1980) and in Tamil as "Vishwaroopam".

Dharam Chand or Dharma (Amitabh Bachchan), an amiable village farmer is thrilled when his wife, Radha (Waheeda Rehman) gives birth to a baby boy, whom they decide to name Raju. Dharma heroically saves the lives of Ajit (Anwar Hussain), Sujit (Sujit Kumar) and Suresh when they are being attacked by a tiger and they graciously offer him a job in Bombay (now Mumbai) whenever he decides to visit. When the village experiences economic crisis and drought, the family migrates to Bombay, where Ajit makes Dharma the manager of his warehouse in the city. 

Dharma is very honest with his job and courteous as well. After a few months, Dharma is tricked into signing a document which makes him the owner of the warehouse he is working at. One fine day the police raid his warehouse and he is arrested for trafficking gold and drugs. 
Being a village simpleton he doesn't understand the law and is easily implicated by his bosses for illegal activities carried out by them.

His pleas of innocence are ignored by the judge and he is sentenced to 18 months in jail plus and additional six months for contempt of court. Sujit visits his destitute family and offers money as compensation for the false implication of Dharma. His wife Radha refuses this, saying that she would not touch ill-gotten wealth. She toils very hard, working as a maid in the neighbourhood and stitching clothes for the locals. The hard work takes a toll on her health, as she is pregnant and one day she falls off the stairs due to weakness. She is admitted to hospital and her sister-in-law Laxmi is the only person around. The doctor gives her a prescription. Laxmi finds herself helpless in this situation and goes to Sujit for money. Although Sujit gives her money, he rapes her before that. Laxmi, in a desolate state, reaches the hospital with the medicines. She hands over it to Dharma, who is out on parole and she dies in his arms (out of poison she had consumed earlier). When Dharma enters the ward, he finds out that their baby has died due to fall Radha has suffered. He is totally heartbroken. 

On his return, his bosses meet him and offer him anything he wishes in compensation. He rejects their offer saying that he would want his baby and sister as compensation. The prison and his hardships have now made him a ruthless man. His bosses sense vengeance and lodge a complaint to inspector Khan, who had earlier arrested him. After a couple of days of his release, Dharma treads out late in the night from his home. His wife attempts to ask him where he is going, to which he replies that henceforth she should not ask him any questions. He straight away heads to Sujit's home and is able to get into his bedroom. Dharma demands all his money as compensation. Sujit agrees to it. Dharma then makes him write a confession letter, in case Sujit complains against him in the police. Sujit writes of all the crimes he has committed against Dharma and hands it over to him. Once this is done, he hangs Sujit from the fan and makes it appear as a suicide. 

Inspector Khan straight away heads to Dharma's home and questions him. Dharma replies that unless he has any evidence against him, he should not question him. Radha understands that Dharma has killed Sujit, but keeps mum. In order to remove any suspicion about the robbery, Dharma hands over all the money to the owner of a hotel as a security deposit to lease his hotel. The deal is that Dharma would pay a paltry sum Rs. 500/month as lease. A formal agreement is done. Inspector Khan questions the owner and suspects foul play, but due to proper paperwork and lack of evidence, he cannot implicate either of them. 

Ajit, now scared of Dharma decides to kill him. He plants a bomb in his home to blow up his whole family. Alert Dharma is able to save his family, but is severely injured. Inspector Khan warns him that although he doesn't have any evidence, the path that Dharma has chosen would lead him back to his own destruction. Next, Dharma targets Suresh. He goes to his home and makes him drink excessive alcohol. Once Suresh is drunk, he gets all his money and information of their illegal business. Once that is done, he pushes him from stairs to make it appear as an accident. Yet again, Khan visits him in the hospital and tries to reason with Dharma to dissuade him from his path. As Inspector Khan doesn't have any evidence, yet again he returns empty handed. 
Once out of hospital, Dharma kills Ajit and starts trading with the peddler whom Ajit traded with. In order to keep the bad influence away from his kid, Dharma sends his son Raju to London for his further education. Years later, Raju (also Amitabh Bachchan) returns home and would like to marry Geeta Verma, (Neetu Singh) whom he met in London, but is unable to meet his father's approval and comes into conflict. Dharma had promised his business partner that he would marry Raju to his daughter. His business partner Rajan was a former employee of Ajit. Rajan runs all the risk as Dharma is officially not a partner of the business and Rajan is facing all the court cases related to their illegal faction of the business. After a certain point, Dharma reconciles with his son and realises that his consent to marriage is equally important. He tells Rajan that he would not be able to fulfill his promise. 

Rajan becomes distraught with this and the thought of betrayal starts slipping into his mind. Unknown to Dharma, Ajit is still alive and has returned and it is time to avenge the past by trying to murder Dharma at any price. Rajan sides with Ajit and attempts to kill Dharma, and in a failed attempt kills his wife instead. Dharma now realizes the bitter truth behind Khan's warning leading to his self-destruction. He then heads towards his end (duel with his rivals), in a bid to save his son's future.

Arun, the son of a rich businessman Ramanathan, returns to India after 10 years in the United States, but as a saint. His shocked father enlists a press reporter, Rekha, to change him back to normal. Rekha first sets up an interview, which he thwarts. Later, on the pretense of taking him to a temple, she plans another set up. On the way to the temple, she pretends that the car has broken down and he leaves to roam around a bit when sees a crying child and offers a chocolate. Suddenly he is swarmed by more children and other villagers who confront him of being a child-kidnapper. Using the event, Rekha cuts Arun's beard off, a symbol of piety. After a few more set up events, he renounces his sainthood.

Later, Arun goes to work and is puzzled about why his father has been sending money to a woman named Sagaya Mary for over twenty years. In a parallel scenario, a man informs Sagaya Mary that someone has proposed to her nephew John. When asked about John's parentage, she opens up about her brother and John's father, Alex Pandian.

A flashback ensues that explains Alex's story. Alex, a scrupulous police officer, is ruthless on criminals and clashes with the mob boss, Egambaram. After repeated confrontations, Egambaram fatally stabs him. With his last breath, Alex vows that he will be reborn to take revenge. When Alex dies, so does his wife after giving birth to twins. Ramanathan's wife gives birth in the same hospital but the child dies, as with her previous three pregnancies. Sagaya Mary hands over one of Alex's children to them and he is christened Arun, while she raises the other child, John.

On his 25th birthday party, Arun gets a divine epiphany that makes him realise he is the reincarnation of Alex. He is asked to meet a woman named Asha at a hotel but it proves to be a set up. In the ensuing battle for survival, he kills the attacker and goes to jail. He comes to court to reveal the truth when suddenly a man claiming to be Alex shows up and says that he is not in fact dead but had been in Sri Lanka the whole time. The man posing as Alex is actually John. Unknown to Arun, he is working with Egambaram, the man who murdered his father.

Later, Arun says he concocted the fact that he was an incarnation of Alex Pandian to draw the killers out. Soon, John finds the truth about Alex Pandian and Arun and fights to save his brother.

Chanthupottu

Chanthupottu is a 2005 Indian Malayalam-language comedy drama film directed by Lal Jose, written by Benny P. Nayarambalam, and produced by Lal. The film was based on a play of the same name, which in turn, was based on the life of an actual man with feminine mannerisms. The story is about a man named Radhakrishnan (Dileep) who was brought up like a girl by his grandmother. This film was a commercial success at the box office.

Radhakrishnan (Dileep) is brought up like a girl by his grandmother (Sukumari) who wanted a granddaughter. She calls him Radha, which becomes his nickname. Radha's father Divakaran (Lal) goes to jail for a murder that he accidentally commits. Radha is ridiculed among the people in the village as he is considered effeminate, but he is not worried and spends time with the girls singing and teaches dancing. His best friend is Malu (Gopika) who is wooed by Kumaran (Indrajith), a local money lender and the son of the man whom Radha's father had killed.

Divakaran comes back from jail and dislikes his son's mannerisms, but can do nothing about them. Slowly Radha's liking for Malu turns into love and when Kumaran sees it, he beats up Radha with the help of her father (Rajan P. Dev), a local astrologer and dumps him in deep sea. But he is saved by Freddy (Biju Menon), a restaurant owner, in some distant shore. Freddy takes him to the former's native where he is living with his sister Rosie (Bhavana) and his grandmother (Valsala Menon), who is a mental patient due to the shock of the sudden death of Freddy's other sibling, Jonfy. He soon becomes a part of their family, as the grandmother begins to identify him as the late Jonfy. With a change in environment, he also changes his behaviour, adopting more traditionally male mannerisms.

Once, he gets involved in a fight with Cleetus (Sreejith Ravi), an old enemy of Freddy, after Cleetus tries to molest Rosie. During the fight, Cleetus gets severely injured on the head. Radha is forced to return to his home to escape from the police.

On reaching his native shore, he discovers that his family, along with his house was brutally burned down by Kumaran. He also learns that Malu is pregnant with Radha's child. His arrival follows a fight with Kumaran. Towards the end of the fight, Radha defeats Kumaran and is about to kill him but, reminded of how his father had to suffer in jail due to murder charges, he spares Kumaran. In the meantime, Malu prematurely gives birth to Radha's child. When Radha sees the child, he vows to raise it as a boy, ripping off the ribbon tied to its hair.


The film was criticized by the LGBT community of Kerala for its distorted portrayal of gender and sexuality. In 2019, queer activists reported that the word "chanthupottu" was used to harass transgender persons, and pointed at the deeply problematic idea that beatings and a heterosexual relationship could "correct" behaviour that goes against traditional gender norms. Prabhakaran and Poovathingal (2013) argue that "the movie brought forth traditional machismo of the male hero and defined an unsophisticated masculinity", despite its attempts to portray an effeminate man in a positive light.



The film was commercial success and ran over 125 days in theatres.

Pedarayudu

Pedarayudu is a 1995 Indian Telugu drama film directed by Ravi Raja Pinisetty and starring Mohan Babu in a dual role. Tamil super star Rajinikanth appears in an important role in the film. Soundarya also starred in the film. For his role, Mohan Babu won the Filmfare Best Actor Award (Telugu). This film is a remake of the 1994 Tamil film, "Nattamai", which starred Sarath Kumar, Meena and Kushboo.

Pedarayudu (Mohan Babu) is a kindhearted and disciplined man. He sits on the ancestral throne in his village to do justice. He hears all the cases and gives solutions to the people and punishments to the wrongdoers. His wife Lakshmi (Bhanupriya) admires and respects him. His brothers Raja (Mohan Babu) and Ravindra (Raja Ravindra) fear for him and also have a lot of respect for him as he has brought them up as his children. Raja marries Bharathi (Soundarya), the daughter of an industrialist (Satyanarayana). She at first never liked Pedarayudu because of his verdicts and attitude and her husband either for being so timid before his brother but later transforms after knowing his greatness from her father. Ravindra loves his paternal cousin, Bhupathi's (Anandaraj) daughter.

In the flashback, Paparayudu (Rajinikanth), Pedarayadu's father, orders Bhupathi to marry his servant's daughter whom he raped, though he is his sister's (Jayanthi) son. His brother-in-law (Chalapathi Rao) shoots him as he is disappointed by his verdict. Enraged, Paparayudu gives his final verdict before dying to abandon their family, and whoever visits his house will receive the same punishment and also not to share even a glass of water with them. Paparayudu also tells Pedarayudu "Whenever we give a wrong verdict, that moment it is said that we die." The moment when he says that, he dies.

Bhupathi builds envy on his uncle's family and waits for an opportunity to take revenge on them. He plans to bring a lady (Subhashri) as a teacher to the school in the village and tells her to make Raja fall for her. She does so to save her father, who is in the hands of Bhupathi. He kills her and makes the villagers believe that Raja has done this. Pedarayudu sentences 10 years of exile for his brother's family. Bhupathi comes to know of his daughter's love and tries to kill Ravindra, with the help of his goons. Raja goes in rescue of him, and pregnant Bharathi goes to Pedarayudu to convey this message. While Raja starts to take revenge on Bhupathi, Pedarayudu's aunt rushes to Pedarayudu, kills Bhupathi, and reveals the truth and tells that he punished his brother without committing any mistake and also told that the crimes that were thrown onto Raja were really done by Bhupathi. Pedarayudu dies on knowing that he gave a wrong verdict, and Raja is shown taking the throne.

Veera (1994 film)

Veera is a 1994 Indian Tamil-language romantic comedy film directed by Suresh Krissna and written by Panchu Arunachalam. A remake of the Telugu film "Allari Mogudu" (1992), it stars Rajinikanth, Meena and Roja with Janagaraj, Senthil, Vadivukkarasi, J. Livingston, Mahesh Anand, Vinu Chakravarthy, Ajay Rathnam and Charuhasan in supporting roles. The film revolves around a man who ends up marrying twice due to circumstances beyond his control, and is forced to live a double life to keep the existence of each wife a secret from the other.

Krissna initially refused to remake "Allari Mogudu" as he disliked it, but assented after Rajinikanth told him their next film after the action-packed "Annaamalai" (1992) should be different to avoid comparisons. The screenplay of "Veera" was written to be substantially different from the original, being tailored to Rajinikanth's style and having logic added to the scenario, though Arunachalam, who made inputs, received sole screenwriting credit. The film was produced by his wife Meena, photographed by P. S. Prakash and edited by Ganesh–Kumar.

"Veera" was released on 14 April 1994, during the Puthandu holiday. The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences were disappointed as they expected a product like "Annaamalai"; despite this, it picked up within a few weeks of its release and became a commercial success, running for 150 days in theatres.

Muthuveerappan, a village musician, comes to the city for a singing contest. He meets tabla player Ravikanth, who has also come for the contest. Muthu tells Ravikanth about how he fell in love with Devayani, the daughter of a song teacher in his village, and how he got her to love him. He came to this contest so he could win the money and pay off the loan his mother had to the village leader. Muthu and Ravikanth perform the song "Konji Konji" and win the contest.

Muthu returns to his village with joy, but learns that Devayani's house had been destroyed by a flood; the bodies of Devayani and her father were not found. Muthu thinks that Devayani is dead. He then goes and gives the money to the village leader, paying off his mother's debt. His mother takes him to the city so that they can find a job and Muthu can forget about Devayani.

When Muthu and his mother reach the city, Muthu learns that his song was a big hit, making him very popular. Viswanathan, the holder of the contest, calls Muthu to come work for him. Muthu does not want to, but his mother persuades him. He assents, and Viswanathan's daughter Roopa falls in love with Muthu. He refuses to marry her as he still loves Devayani, but after his mother tells him that Devayani will not come back and she wishes to see his marriage, he assents.

After the marriage, Roopa goes to the United States for her father's surgery after he suddenly suffers a heart attack. Devayani is revealed to have survived the flood, but has amnesia. She regains her memory after hearing Muthu's songs on the radio, then promptly boards a bus bound for the city and meets Muthu at the recording studio. He is surprised and overjoyed, but does not tell her about his marriage to Roopa. Devayani is adamant to get married soon, so they both marry.

Muthu is forced to live a double life – as Devayani's husband under his original name, and Roopa's husband Veera. He nearly gets caught when both Roopa and Muthu with Devayani go to a "sari" shop and bump into each other. To prove that Muthu and Veera are two different people, he takes a photograph and manipulates it to show two of him shaking hands. As expected, Devayani and Roja believe that Muthu and Veera are two different people.

Harishchandra, a criminal who Muthu had earlier handed over to the police, takes revenge by kidnapping his wives. He also knows that Muthu and Veera are one person, and when he comes to save them the truth is revealed. After he saves both his wives, they fight over him; Roopa says that he officially married her first while Devayani says that she fell in love first. His wives do not want to share. When he tries to explain, they go away angrily. Muthu then decides to return to his old house. When he enters, he finds that both his wives are there. They take a bag each from him and flounce off in opposite directions.


Actor Rajinikanth, director Suresh Krissna and producer-screenwriter Panchu Arunachalam saw the Telugu film "Allari Mogudu" (1992). Rajinikanth talked about remaking it in Tamil, but Krissna objected as he did not like the film. Rajinikanth told him about his desire to do a "two-wife" comedy, but Krissna noticed that "Allari Mogudu" lacked the values associated with typical Rajinikanth films, and felt fans would not accept his character being bigamous; Rajinikanth said changes could be made to suit the local milieu. Krissna wanted to begin work on "Baashha", of which he already had some plot points ready, but Rajinikanth warned him that if their next film after the action-packed "Annaamalai" (1992) was anything similar or bigger, "we will get caught. Bring the hopes down, bring the level down and then take it up again. So you make a good entertaining film, and people will say it wasn't like ["Annaamalai"]." Krissna assented, but avoided creating a shot-for-shot remake.

Rajinikanth and Krissna went to the Taj Banjara hotel in Hyderabad to discuss the plot threadbare and reach a consensus about the story. Soon, they had a fresh outline ready, with the process having taken ten days; Krissna had tailored the story to Rajinikanth's style and added logic to the scenario. He submitted the final draft to Arunachalam who liked it and made more suggestions about what to keep and what not. According to Krissna, the remake had more "emotional profundity" than the Telugu original, and it was established here that the protagonist Muthuveerappan was a pious person who only ended up with two wives due to circumstances beyond his control. He differentiated him from the original's protagonist, emphasising that though circumstances drove him to another woman (Roopa), his feelings for his first wife Devayani were sincere, he had not forgotten her, and was forced by his mother into marrying again.

For the scene where Muthuveerappan's mother wrenches the thread from his wrist (tied by Devayani) to suggest their bonding has ended, the symbolism was entirely Arunachalam's idea. Whereas in "Allari Mogudu", the second wife's desire for the protagonist is more on a physical plane, the carnal aspect in "Veera" was made secondary. According to Krissna, "we polished the screenplay over and over again till it gathered sheen. Eventually, but for the basic plot, "Veera" emerged as a near-new product." The film was produced by Arunachalam's wife Meena under their home banner P. A. Art Productions, and Arunachalam received sole credit for the screenplay, while P. Satyanand, the writer of "Allari Mogudu", received credit for the original story. Cinematography was handled by P. S. Prakash, editing by the duo Ganesh–Kumar, art direction by Magie, action choreography by Raju, and dance choreography by Raghuram.

Rajinikanth played Muthuveerapan, who juggles between two lives: Muthu, the husband of his first love; and Veera, the husband of his second love. Meena was chosen to play Devayani, reprising her role from the Telugu original, while Roja was chosen as Roopa. Senthil was cast as the tabla player Ravikanth, Janagaraj as Roopa's father Vishwanathan, Vadivukkarasi as Muthuveerappan's mother Parvathi, J. Livingston as Chandran, newcomer Mahesh Anand as the antagonist Harishchandra, Vinu Chakravarthy as Pannaiyar, Ajay Rathnam as his son Rathnavelu, and Charuhasan in an uncredited role as Devayani's father Krishnamurthy Shastri.

Principal photography began at Rajahmundry. A four-day shooting schedule was planned for the song "Maadethile Kanni" at Talakona, with 40 background dancers. After the first day's shoot, Krissna expressed dissatisfaction as the location did not provide him with the expected quality. The team returned to Chennai, and shot the song at Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam, with a house at AVM Studios also being used for the shoot. "Konji Konji" was shot at Narada Gana Sabha, Chennai. Since the song which depicts Muthuveerapan performing on stage "didn't lend itself to anything vibrant", Krissna intercut it with scenes where Roopa visualises Muthuveerapan in various outfits and begins to find him attractive. He believed this was a chance to show Muthuveerapan in a variety of costumes since, until the song begins, he is only shown wearing a simple white shirt and black trousers, and would not be having a change in attire and appearance until the film's latter half. Krissna decided to "let the audience get a glimpse of how [Muthuveerapan] would look later on in the film" through this song.

"Malai Kovil Vaasalil" was shot at the MRF Racing Track, Thiruperumbudur. As the song depicts Devayani having formed Muthu's name (முத்து) by arranging thousands of lamps to form each letter, twenty thousand lamps were made to glow simultaneously. Due to strong winds there, Krissna decided to use chimney lamps that blocked the wind from extinguishing the lights. The song was to be shot from a great height to give more emphasis to the glowing lamps while Devayani "should appear as a mere spot in the middle of gigantic lamps", so Prakash went to a nearby tower, roughly 200 feet away from the actual spot so that the camera could zoom in and out for best results. Krissna described it as "one of the most strenuous and painstakingly shot sequences" in his career. For the fight sequence where Muthuveerapan and Harischandra jump high towards each other and then fall to the ground with their hands interlocked, Rajinikanth and Anand did not rehearse the shot; they watched the stuntmen perform and followed their instructions. Rajinkanth performed all the stunts by himself without using a stunt double.

For the scene displaying a large, multicoloured kolam of Muthuveerapan designed by Roopa, Magie's assistant Mani designed the kolam, which covered a floor area of 100 x 200 feet; a rope was attached to a pulley, one side of which was attached to Mani's waist. He was then made to hang horizontally from it, with his face and hands turned towards the floor, and complete the task. It took him two days and two nights. A scene where Muthuveerapan and Ravikanth futilely attempt to fool Roopa at a temple was shot at Hyderabad's Birla Mandir, which did not generally permit the shooting of films. There were no retakes for this scene, and some of Rajinikanth and Senthil's acting was improvised. While filming the scene where Ravikanth talks to Chandran while Muthuveerapan silently witnesses, Rajinikanth could not control laughing at Senthil's dialogue delivery; therefore, he covered his mouth with a towel. In the post-production phase, Meena's voice was dubbed by K. R. Anuradha, and the introductory "Super Star" graphic title card from "Annaamalai" was re-used.

Writer S. Rajanayagam compared "Veera" to another Rajinikanth film "Panakkaran" (1990) because both the films stress that "true wealth consists of good parents, wife, children and friends". Though the film is an acknowledged remake of "Allari Mogudu", many writers have compared it to "Rettai Vaal Kuruvi" (1987) and "Micki & Maude" (1984) as they two had bigamy as their theme.

The soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja and the lyrics were written by him, Panchu Arunachalam and Vaali. It was released under the Pyramid Music label. Some of the songs are set in Carnatic and Hindustani ragas; "Konji Konji" is set in the Carnatic Dharmavati, "Maadethile Kanni" is set in the Hindustani Brindabani Sarang, "Malai Kovil Vaasalil" is set in the Carnatic Asaveri, "Pattu Poo Poo" is set in the Carnatic Chalanata, and "Thirumagal" is set in the Carnatic Lalitha. "Konji Konji" has two versions: one sung by S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, the other by K. S. Chithra.

"Veera" was released on 14 April 1994, during the Puthandu holiday. The film received mixed critical reviews; audiences and fans of Rajinikanth were disappointed as they expected a product like "Annaamalai". Malini Mannath wrote for "The Indian Express", ""Veera" starts promisingly enough", praising Rajinikanth's comedy timing in the first half, but the manner of Muthu learning of Devayani's presumed death was "not very convincingly told". She said that with the return of Devayani, "The script takes a nosedive here, never to recover." Malini Mannath added that while Rajinikanth's comedy was good initially, it felt forced in the second half, and "At this stage of his career [Rajinikanth] could have taken more meaningful roles", but concluded by praising the songs. A writer of the magazine "Manushi" said, "The director has displayed much ingenuity in bringing the first supposedly dead "wife" back to life, bringing the two wives together, etc. The final scenes were shoddy, ill-conceived and in bad taste."

"Veera" took time to gather momentum. The film had lukewarm response for the first few weeks because of comparisons with "Annaamalai". After a few weeks, it began its victory run, and completed a 150-day run in theatres. Krissna attributed the film's success to its comedy angle, and Rajinikanth's popularity after "Annaamalai" which had "soared to unimaginable heights". It also redeemed Rajinikanth's reputation to an extent, following the failure of his home production "Valli" (1993). According to journalist Sudhir Srinivasan, it was the first Tamil film to collect in the NSC (North Arcot, South Arcot and Chengalpattu) area, whereas historian G. Dhananjayan said it collected that much "in Chengalpettu alone". Despite "Allari Mogudu" having a Hindi remake titled "Saajan Chale Sasural" (1996), "Veera" has been dubbed in that language and released under a number of different titles.

Rajinikanth's English dialogue "How is it?" (pronounced "Owwizzit?") became immensely popular, as did the response "Super" (pronounced "Soopar").

Uzhaippali

Uzhaippali () is a 1993 Tamil language action drama film, directed by P. Vasu. It stars Rajinikanth in the lead role. The film was a 'super hit' at the box office.

Rajini is working as a coolie in a factory. He is asked by three brothers (Nizhalgal Ravi, Radharavi, S. S. Chandran) to act as a foreign-returned rich man, the heir of a property. Rajini acts, but always escapes as he doesn't want to face consequences. But then he comes to know that he is the heir to the property, his father was killed by three brothers to take away the property and mother (Sujatha) became a mental patient. He avenges the death of his father by killing the villains. At last, he says he doesn't want to be an heir to money and always remains as a coolie.

"Uzhaippali" marked the comeback of Vijaya Productions who stopped producing for 20 years. This was P. Vasu's third collaboration with Rajinikanth after "Panakkaran" and "Mannan". P. Vasu directed Uzhaippali after the grand success of Mannan. Unlike a remake film, Vasu penned the original story based on MGR's formula film Enga Veetu Pillai.

On 5 February 1993, Uzhaippali had a grand pooja at Vijaya Vauhini studio. The pooja was conducted even though the distributors not willing to distribute the film and the Red Card against Rajini wasn't removed. Entire film personalities attended the launch and the media covered the news in an exclusive manner.

When the shooting was happening in Chickmanglore, cast and crew were refused to book rooms in hotel for not paying the discount, Rajini was sleeping in car due to non-availability.

Ejamaan

Ejamaan () is a 1993 Tamil-language romantic drama film directed by R. V. Udhayakumar. It stars Rajinikanth and Meena in the lead roles. It was a blockbuster box office success and completed a 175-days run in 25 theaters,100 days in 50 theaters, 50 days in 75 theatres. It was later dubbed in Telugu as "Rowdy Jamindar".

Vaanavarayan (Rajinikanth) is a feudal chieftain, adored and respected by the people of his village. He lives with his grandparents (M. N. Nambiar & Manorama). Following his advice, they abstain from voting in the elections and instead, pool the money given by the candidates to get themselves some basic amenities. Vallavaraayan (Napoleon) is his arch enemy. Their enmity is further sharpened when Vaanavarayan wins the hand of Vaitheeswari (Meena), whom Vallavaraayan had also wished to wed. Vallavaraayan then convinces the priest of the village temple to mix poison in the holy water that Vaitheeswari drinks. As a result, she becomes incapable of conceiving a baby. But surprisingly, Vaitheeswari soon becomes pregnant-though she has pretended with the help of the mid-wife (S. N. Lakshmi), to do so to uphold her husband's honour. She takes poison and kills herself unable to bear the grief of being incapable of giving her husband a child and on her deathbed makes Vaanavarayan swear to take Ponni (Aishwariya) as his wife. Vaanavarayan however refuses until Ponni agrees to marry Sembattai (Thalapathi Dinesh)- Vallavarayan's henchman-who abandons her to Vallavarayan's vice. Infuriated, Vaanavarayan attacks Vallavarayan and spares his life after giving him a sermon on how to win the heart of the people.


After the success of "Chinna Gounder", Udayakumar was approached by various producers but he was unsure as to who should play the part of the hero for his next film. Subsequently, he decided to cast Rajini as the hero for his next film. Rajini agreed to act under the direction of Udayakumar. The director expressed his interest to make this film for AVM Productions. Initially, a different script titled "Jilla Collector" was narrated but Udaykumar subsequently opted to film a different script altogether, since AVM Saravanan had felt that the original script might go over budget. The actress Meena was selected as the heroine. Rajini was initially reluctant to have her as the heroine because she had appeared as a child artist for his film "Anbulla Rajinikanth" and he felt that his fans might not readily accept this pairing. But he eventually agreed to have Meena play the part. "Ejamaan" was Rajini's 141st film and his 8th collaboration with AVM Productions.

All Music composed by Ilayaraja while lyrics written by Vaali and R. V. Udayakumar. There are a total of eight tracks for this film. The song "Oru Naalum" is based on Sindhubhairavi Raga.

Malini Mannath of "The Indian Express" wrote "Yajaman is a well meant film from AVM and from director Udayakumar". K. Vijiyan of "New Straits Times" wrote "The film begins well but gets bogged down after the interval and the large number of songs do not help matters".

"Chinna Gounder" and "Ejamaan" had started the trend of portrayals of village chieftain in films. The success of the films inspired similar themes - including "Nattamai" (1994).

Director Rajmohan directed a film titled "Vanavarayan Vallavarayan" (2014) named after Rajinikanth and Napoleon's characters, and starring Kreshna and Makapa Anand in lead roles. Dhanapal Padmanabhan who directed "Krishnaveni Panjaalai" (2012), rated "Ejaman" "as the film that best captured the village flavour and beauty of Pollachi". One of the songs has inspired as a title for the film - "Nilave Mugam Kaattu" (1999).

Annaamalai

Annaamalai (also spelt Annamalai; ) is a 1992 Indian Tamil-language action drama film directed by Suresh Krissna and produced by Kavithalayaa Productions. A remake of the 1987 Hindi film "Khudgarz", itself based on Jeffrey Archer's novel "Kane and Abel", it stars Rajinikanth, Kushboo and Sarath Babu with Radha Ravi, Nizhalgal Ravi and Manorama in supporting roles. The film revolves around Annaamalai, a poor milkman, and Ashok, the son of a rich businessman, who have been friends since childhood, a friendship opposed by Ashok's father who attempts to create a rift between the two.

"Annaamalai" was launched with director Vasanth, who later opted out due to personal reasons. Suresh Krissna replaced him as director, and also contributed to the screenplay while Shanmugasundaram wrote the dialogues. Principal photography of the film began in March 1992 and the entire filming process lasted 45 working days. The score and soundtrack were composed by Deva and lyrics for all songs were written by Vairamuthu. The cinematography was handled by P. S. Prakash and editing by the duo Ganesh–Kumar.

"Annaamalai" was released on 27 June 1992. The film became a box-office success, running for 175 days in theatres and was the highest-grossing film in Tamil cinema until 1995 when the record was broken by "Baashha". It was remade in Telugu in 1993 as "Kondapalli Raja" and in Kannada in 2003 as "Gokarna".

Annaamalai is a milkman, while Ashok is the owner of a five-star hotel in Chennai. They have been very close friends since their childhood. Ashok's father Gangadharan never liked his son's friendship with a poor milkman. Annaamalai is kind-hearted and innocent, and falls in love with Subbulakshmi, a college girl he eventually marries. Ashok too falls in love with a poor girl, Shanthi. Annaamalai arranges Ashok and Shanthi's wedding which angers Gangadharan as he thinks Shanthi does not have the status to become his daughter-in-law.

Annaamalai encounters a problem with a politician named Ekambaram following which Ekambaram understands Annaamalai's good nature. Annaamalai's small home along with a few cents of empty land is located in prime location, to which Annaamalai held sentimental values to, made Gangadharan pressurise Ashok to buy so that they can construct a star hotel. Ashok is initially hesitant as he does not want to mix business and friendship, but later agrees. Annaamalai happily accepts and also agrees to give the land for free of cost emulating pure friendship. Ashok feels proud of Annaamalai and informs his father that Annaamalai has to be made a shareholder in the new hotel. Gangadharan agrees but decides to cheat Annaamalai and gets signature in empty papers.

The star hotel is constructed and Gangadharan plans to demolish Annaamalai's home which is located next to the hotel. Gangadharan and Ashok's cousin Sargunam forge documents and take control of Annaamalai's empty land. Annaamalai learns of this plan and picks up quarrel with Gangadharan. Ashok interrupts and he misunderstands Annaamalai without knowing the truth for fighting with Ashok's father. Ashok gets angry and demolishes Annaamalai's home which is in the remembrance of Annaamalai's father. In response, Annaamalai challenges that he will also become rich and take revenge on Ashok.

Ekambaram helps Annaamalai to secure funds. Annaamalai starts a small sweets business and, over the course of fifteen years, he becomes so rich and he also builds a star hotel in Chennai which becomes more popular than Ashok's hotel. Sargunam steals money from Ashok and knowing this, Ashok asks him to leave. Sargunam joins Annaamalai's hotel and also gets married to Annaamalai's sister, Kamala. Annaamalai wins Ashok and become the president of hotels association and Ashok also faces financial troubles. Annaamalai's daughter and Ashok's son love each other; Annamalai opposes this because of his hatred for Ashok. Annaamalai and Ashok appear for a public auction and the auction price keeps increasing. Ashok wins the auction for despite Gangadharan asking him not to quote such a huge amount as this was a trick played by Annaamalai to increase the price.

Ashok has no money to pay for the auction and is forced to sell his bungalow to get money. Annaamalai purchases Ashok's bungalow, thereby winning the challenge made years ago. But Annaamalai gives the registration document to his mother Sivagami and asks her to handover to Ashok itself as he does not want to punish his friend. Ashok and Gangadharan realise their mistake and apologise to Sivagami knowing Annaamalai's kind heart. Annaamalai also gets to know that it was only Gangadharan and Sargunam who forged the documents and Ashok was unaware of his father's plans. Sargunam later hires an assassin to kill Ashok to usurp his wealth. But Annaamalai saves Ashok, kills the assassin and Sargunam seeks forgiveness. Annaamalai and Ashok reconcile, and fix their children's marriage.


Additionally, Karan appears as Ashok's son Deepak, and Dakshayini as Annaamalai's daughter Priya, both uncredited.

In the first week of March 1992, the newspaper "Dina Thanthi" announced K. Balachander's production house Kavithalayaa Productions' next film "Annaamalai", with Vasanth as director and Rajinikanth as lead actor. When the title of the film was announced as "Annaamalai", few people has misgivings about the title as it would create a negative connotation. Balachander and Rajinikanth had decided on the title and refused to change it. After completing work on "Jaagruti" on 8 March, Suresh Krissna left for Madras (now Chennai) the next morning; he wanted a break as he had not yet signed his next film. Upon arrival the same day, he was informed that Balachander, his mentor, was waiting for him. Krissna visited Balachander, who told him that Vasanth had left "Annaamalai", which was scheduled to begin filming in two days and its release date fixed for June. When asked if he would direct, Krissna received an advance of and accepted. Vasanth has never expanded on why he left, saying it was only due to "personal reasons". Visu claims he was hired as the director before Vasanth, but due to some contradiction with Rajinikanth, he opted out.

At the time of Krissna's arrival, the script was not complete; he met the film's screenwriter Shanmugasundaram, who narrated the main story: the "friendship between a poor milkman and a rich man, with the former's house being a point of conflict". Krissna realised there was still a lot of work to be done because reasons like "why does his house mean so much to him, why does the rich man's father hate this milkman, what angers the hero so much that he goes against his rich friend" had yet to be established. The story was based on the Hindi film "Khudgarz" (1987), which itself was based on Jeffrey Archer's novel "Kane and Abel". Unlike "Khudgarz", where the rich man was the main character, Rajinikanth's character, the poor man, was made the main character. When Krissna asked Shanmugasundaram about the "incomplete pockets" in the story, Shanmugasundaram replied that it could all be developed over the course of production. Shanmugasundaram had been hired at Rajinikanth's suggestion.

When Krissna met Rajinikanth, he told him that there was a substantial amount of work to be done in the script, but liked the plot. Shortly before the beginning of principal photography, which was scheduled to begin on 11 March and continue its first schedule for ten days, only the main cast – Rajinikanth as the title character, Khushbu as his love interest and Sarath Babu as his friend Ashok – had been finalised. Khushbu's character initially had the same name as her, but this was later changed to Subbulakshmi alias "Subbu". Since the script was not complete, there was no proper shooting schedule, and Manorama was initially unavailable. But after another film she had signed got cancelled, she was cast in "Annaamalai" as the title character's mother Sivagami. Radha Ravi was cast as Ashok's father Gangadharan. He was not interested in playing an elderly character, but agreed to appear in "Annaamalai" at Rajinikanth's insistence. Pre-production works such as casting and location hunting took place on the day before shooting began. Balachander's wife Rajam and their daughter Pushpa Kandhaswamy received the producer credit.

"Annaamalai" was launched at AVM Studios at the venue of Pillaiyar temple. Principal photography began on 11 March 1992. After the film's muhurat shot, the first scene to be filmed was a comedy scene where Annaamalai would save Ashok, who has been brought to court for a minor offence. Krissna removed the scene from the final cut as he felt it had no bearing on the script.

The scene where Annaamalai enters a ladies' hostel and gets terrified by a snake was shot at Chakra House, Alwarpet. A snake was brought specially for the scene. The owner of the snake earlier worked in previous films of Rajinikanth. Suresh asked his assistants Nagappan and K. Natraj to check the details about the snake charmer. Krissna recalled that he covered his nervousness with his smile. Krissna told cinematographer P. S. Prakash to use zoom lens so that he could adjust a camera according to the situation. After the scene was finished, the members of the crew enjoyed the shot. Krissna congratulated Rajinikanth and asked him how he performed it so well and if it was planned, and Rajinikanth replied it was not planned; expressions in the scene were a result of his fear. In the same scene, Shanmugasundaram came with initial dialogues to convey Annaamalai's fear. Krissna felt that dialogues were redundant in such situation. Rajinikanth insisted to keep "Kadavule Kadavule" (Oh God! Oh God!) as the dialogue. Krissna agreed to keep the dialogue as it went well into the situation of the scene. According to Krissna, nobody on set realised that the snake's mouth was not stitched; it was only after filming ended for that day that the director came to realise that Rajinikanth's life was at risk the entire time.

Krissna wanted the picturisation of "Vanthenda Paalkaaran" to be vibrant and colourful stating that he got inspired from the Hindi songs of Amitabh Bachchan. The scene where Annaamalai shows his face to the camera was extended in slow motion by Krissna as fans would feel as if he was looking towards the audience. The song was choreographed by Prabhu Deva. The title song "Annaamalai" where the title character and Subbu appear in periodic costumes was shot at Fern Hill Palace Hotel while the matching shots were shot at Sivaji Gardens. Krissna shot the song sequence in a technique where the lip sync is perfect while the dance movements being fast revealing that he got inspired from the song "Mamavukku Koduma" from "Punnagai Mannan" (1986). The scene where Annaamalai beats up Sargunam in a one-sided fight was filmed at Hotel Ambassador Pallava. Filming was completed in 45 working days.

"Annaamalai" was edited by the duo Ganesh–Kumar. It was the first film to feature the introductory "Super Star" graphic title card, where the words 'SUPER' and 'STAR' form in blue dots on the screen followed by R-A-J-N-I in gold, set to the sound of laser beams while the word "Hey!" plays in loop in the background. This idea was conceived by Krissna, who was inspired by the opening gun barrel sequence in the James Bond films, and felt that Rajinikanth, who was becoming a phenomenon, "warranted a unique logo to go with his name".

Rajinikanth initially objected to the inclusion of the Super Star title card as he felt it was "brazen self-aggrandisement" and "embarrassing", but Krissna convinced him, saying it would generate large applause. Balachander supported Krissna, and asked Rajinikanth, "What is wrong in Suresh's idea Rajini? People are clapping for your name. It is a great idea and let's go for it", after which Rajinikanth relented. The final cut of the film was initially , at a time when the length of Tamil films was restricted to , equal to two hours and forty-five minutes. With the removal of the courtroom scene, the film's final length was reduced by .

The soundtrack was composed by Deva, with lyrics by Vairamuthu. It was released under the Lahari label. "Annaamalai" marked Deva's first collaboration with Rajinikanth. Balachander chose him as composer due to a misunderstanding with his usual composer Ilaiyaraaja. Rajinikanth and Krissna were initially worried with the choice of Deva. When Krissna met Deva, he had already composed the song "Annaamalai Annaamalai" when Vasanth was the director. The song is set in the Carnatic raga known as Mohanam.

"Vanthenda Paalkaaran" was inspired by a Kannada poem which Rajinikanth had suggested; the poem talked about cows as deities, useful to humans in many ways. Vairamuthu grasped the core of the poem and embellished it further, adding an element of contrast between the ever-giving cow and selfish humans who only take from other beings. He also inserted a few ingenious words to boost Rajinikanth's image as a "mass hero" of the Tamils, such as "Ennai Vaazha Vaithadhu Tamizh Paalu" (It is the milk of love from you Tamils that has given me life). The song's tune is based on the Marathi folk song "Mee Dolkar Daryacha Raja" (1969). The theme song, which does not appear on the soundtrack and plays during the Super Star graphic title card, was inspired by the James Bond Theme.
"Annaamalai" was released on 27 June 1992. Its opening was threatened since the new government of J. Jayalalithaa implemented a new rule where posters of films were prohibited in Madras. Nevertheless, according to Krissna, the lack of promos only increased the hype and worked to the film's advantage;

In a review dated 3 July, Lalitha Dileep of "The Indian Express" said, "the film combines good screenplay, proficient direction and first rate acting. The end result is both entertaining and engrossing". She said the metamorphosis of Annaamalai from a simpleton to a wealthy man was "done in a plausible manner and with great cinematic finesse", praised the editing, the cinematography, the music and lyrics, concluding, "["Annaamalai"] is enjoyable and touching." K. Vijiyan of "New Straits Times" wrote on 11 July, "["Annaamalai"] will be hit with Rajni's admirers but a disappointment for Balachander's discerning fans who are looking for a story with a difference". A special screening was held for actor Sivaji Ganesan who told Krissna, "In my heyday, the camera remained steady while I would move up and down to make an impact as a hero, but you've limited [Rajinikanth's] movements and made the camera whirl around. The dynamism of the shots have helped project heroism better [...] You've showcased another dimension of [Rajinikanth]. The film's plus is its making."

The film completed a 175-day run at the box office. It was the highest-grossing film in Tamil cinema until 1995 when the record was broken by "Baashha". The collections of "Annaamalai" sent tremors everywhere. "Annaamalai" exceeded normal regional collections making the film producers all over India sit up and take notice. With "Annaamalai", Rajinikanth's range increased and made him the highest-paid actor in India till now. Tamil Manila Congress and DMK ally prioritised 'Annaamalai Cycle', and won the 1996 elections by a huge margin. For his performance, Rajinikanth won the Ambika Award for Best Actor. 

"Annaamalai" was remade into Telugu in 1993 as "Kondapalli Raja", and into Kannada in 2003 as "Gokarna". Despite its Telugu remake, the film was also dubbed in that language as "Birla Ramudu".

"Annaamalai" set a trend in Tamil cinema: a "mass introduction song for a hero". Additionally, the "Super Star" graphic title card continued to feature in many of Rajinikanth's later films like "Veera" (1994), "Baashha" and "Muthu" (1995). Jai stated that his character from "Engaeyum Eppothum" (2011) "was almost modelled on the lines of Rajini Sir in the first half of ["Annaamalai"]". Suresh Krishna directed "Aarumugam" in 2009 which critics compared with "Annaamalai" due to its similar plot and characterisations.

The dialogue "Naan Solradaiyum Seiven, Soladadeiyum Seiven" (I'll do what I say, I'll also do what I don't say) attained popularity.

The scenes from the film were parodied in "Paarthale Paravasam" (2001), "Boss Engira Bhaskaran" (2010), and "Thamizh Padam" (2010).

When he fell seriously ill, his friend and doctor Farid prevailed upon Prem to bring his girl friend Rita, whom he wanted to marry. But as luck would have it, Rita had gone away to Srinagar to participate in a fashion show and she could not return, as due to snowfall all roads were blocked and air service was suspended. To satisfy his dying grandfather, Prem suggested to his company's Public Relations Officer Jagdish to hire a model girl who could pose as Rita for some time. Instead, Jagdish brought an illiterate flower seller girl Kammo, with whom Prem and his sweetheart Rita had many altercations.
But when Rita came, followed by her scheming mother, Kammo knew that her days were numbered. Yet all efforts of Rita and her mother to win the grandfather's favours failed. Ultimately, on the birthday of the grandfather, Rita's mother divulged the truth to doctor Farid. And at the birthday party, it was apparent that Kammo's true identity was known to everyone. Despite this, the grandfather announced his grandson's engagement to Kammo, whom he had really liked. His grandson blew into a rage and threatened to leave the house along with Rita and her mother. The grandfather did not stop him. Prem rushed to Rita only to find that without his grandfather's wealth, his love and sacrifice had no meaning for her. Meanwhile, Kammo, hurt and disillusioned, decided to leave the house for good. Did Prem realise his mistake? Did Kammo forgive him? Did the grandfather welcome him back? See for yourself.

Dhund (1973 film)

Dhund (translation: "Fog") is a 1973 Hindi movie produced and directed by B. R. Chopra. It stars Sanjay Khan, Zeenat Aman, Danny Denzongpa, Deven Verma, Madan Puri, Navin Nischol and Ashok Kumar. The music is by Ravi.

The plot is inspired by Agatha Christie's play, "The Unexpected Guest".
It was later remade in Tamil as "Puriyadha Pudhir (1991)."

On a foggy night, Chandrashekhar (Navin Nischol), who is driving his car at high speed, meets with an accident. He walks to a nearby house to ask for assistance. When nobody answers the door, he enters the house and finds the dead body of a wheelchair-bound man. Standing nearby is a beautiful, young woman, Rani (Zeenat Aman), with a gun. She tells him that the dead man is her husband and she has murdered him. She asks Chandrashekhar to call the police. Intrigued, Chandrashekhar asks Rani to tell her what happened. She tells him that her husband, Thakur Ranjit Singh (Danny Denzongpa), was a cruel man who used to mistreat his family and used to shoot cats and dogs with his gun for amusement (which is why nobody in the house woke up upon hearing the gunshot). On this night, before Chandrashekhar arrived, they had an argument and when her husband threatened to shoot her, she tried to take the gun away from him. In the ensuing struggle, Ranjit got shot.

Since the murder is an accidental death and was done in self-defense, Chandrashekhar decides to help Rani. Together, they fake a robbery so that Ranjit's death appears to be case of a theft gone wrong and more importantly, to suggest that the murder happened at a different time and give Rani an alibi. When the police arrive, Chandrashekhar tells them that he had bumped into a man who had just come out of the house. The man had dropped a gun, which Chandrashekhar hands over to the police. Because it was a foggy night, he says he cannot identify the man.

The police start investigating the murder and become convinced that it was committed by an insider as the "thief" seems to know his way around the house. Some of the important evidence they find at the crime scene is the dead man's pocket watch, an empty cigar container, and a tea tray which has fingerprints of an unknown person. Police soon find out that the cigar container and fingerprints belong to Suresh Saxena (Sanjay Khan), a prominent lawyer and a friend of the family. Investigation reveals that Suresh was having an affair with Rani. Suresh denies being at the house on the night of the murder and claims to have been at a party that he had thrown. But upon enquiring, the police find out that Suresh had received a phone call from a woman and had subsequently left the party for about an hour. The police inspector shows Suresh's photograph to Chandrashekhar and ask him if Suresh was the man he had run into that night. But Chandrashekhar sticks to his story and says that he cannot positively identify the person.

Chandrashekhar tells Rani that the police think that Suresh committed the murder. Rani tells him how she first met Suresh when he stopped her from throwing herself off a cliff. Suresh had befriended Ranjit and had become a regular visitor to their house. Rani and Suresh had fallen in love but their romance was discovered by Ranjit. On the night of the murder, Ranjit got into a furious argument with Rani and threatened to destroy Suresh's budding political career by exposing his affair with a married woman. Rani calls Suresh at his party to warn him. Later that night, when she was taking a shower, she heard Suresh and her husband arguing with each other. By the time, Rani came out of the shower, the argument had ended. But a few minutes later, she again heard her husband shout at someone. But the noise of an airplane flying overhead drowned out all voices. By the time, she reached downstairs, Suresh had left. She confronted her husband and in the ensuring struggle, shot him. It is at this point that Chandrashekhar had walked in.

The police arrest Suresh and charge him with the murder. At the trial, the public prosecutor explains that the love affair between Suresh and Rani was the motive for the murder. The prosecutor tells the court that Suresh was present in the house at the time of the murder (the phone call and his disappearance from the party for an hour, during which the crime was committed). The prosecutor also establishes that the murder was committed long before Chandrashekhar walked into the house. He presents the dead man's pocket watch as evidence; the watch had stopped working when the fatal bullet hit it and therefore, reveals the actual time of murder. A second bullet was fired to mislead the rest of the household about the time of the murder. As the evidence mounts against Suresh, Rani panics and confesses to the murder. She asks the court to bring back Chandrashekhar to the stand so that he can tell the true story. The court is adjourned till next day. That night Chandrashekhar is visited by a nun.

As though as the consequence of it the truth is revealed next day in the court. Wish you can really enjoy the end. Whether the judgment is strictly legal is open to question. But the audience would certainly like it. The crux of the film is in its suspense. A link also given to watch. Please do not reveal the SUSPENSE to others.

R. Sundarrajan initially planned to direct "Amman Kovil Kizhakale" with Rajinikanth which did not happen. When Sundarrajan met Panchu Arunachalam who was finding plot for a new project with collaboration of S. P. Muthuraman and Rajinikanth, he narrated the plotline of "Rajathi Raja" which impressed both Rajinikanth and Arunachalam. Rajinikanth insisted Sundarrajan to direct the film who relented after initial rejections to direct the film. The film was produced under Ilaiyaraaja's brother R. D. Bhaskar under their home banner Pavalar Creations. Cinematography was handled by Rajarajan, and editing by B. Lenin and V. T. Vijayan.

Initially, Revathi and Rupini were reported to play the two female characters in the film. Due to date clashes, Revathi's role was given to Radha and Rupini's role to Nadhiya. This was the last film for Radha to act with Rajinikanth and it was the only film for Nadhiya with Rajinikanth.

Radha Ravi, who portrayed one of the antagonists in the film, initially "approached the role like a serious villain". However, when he was told that his character knows Rajinikanth’s real identity, "I decided to play the character like a muff, and when I suggested the idea to director Sundarrajan, he accepted it". Radha also intentionally mimicked his father M. R. Radha's voice and took inspiration from his father's character from the 1961 film "Paava Mannippu". Radha Ravi also said Rajinikanth wanted this scene where there will be a snake in the hand, Sundarrajan "wasn’t keen on having this as he felt it was over the top" but Rajinikanth insisted on this scene because “he liked to have a snake scene in his films for sentimental reasons”.

The song "Vaa Vaa" was initially planned to shoot at Ooty but due to heavy rainfall, the crew then decided to shoot the song at Coonoor and again went back to Ooty during its non rainy day and completed the remaining shoot. The filming was completed in 50 days.

The music was composed by Ilaiyaraaja.

Kodi Parakuthu

Kodi Parakuthu () is a 1988 Tamil language action film, directed by P. Bharathiraja. The film starred Rajinikanth, who worked with Bharathiraja nearly a decade after their last film "16 Vayathinile" (1977). The film got mixed reviews and was an above average grosser at the box office.


The music was composed by Hamsalekha. The song "Selai Kattum" is set in the raga Shree.

"The Indian Express" wrote ""Kodi Parakkudhu" is a flag that flutters in full flow, its not a half-mast performance and there's no question of Bharathiraja having surrendered creativity at the altar of starry caprice". The film was commercially unsuccessful.

Dharmathin Thalaivan

Dharmathin Thalaivan (English: Righteous Leader) is a 1988 Indian Tamil action-drama film directed by S. P. Muthuraman, starring Rajinikanth in dual roles, along with Prabhu, Suhasini, Kushboo, Nassar and Captain Raju in other roles. The movie is a remake of the 1978 Bollywood film "Kasme Vaade". The film marked the debut of Kushboo in Tamil cinema. The film was declared a superhit at the box office and completed a 100-day run in many centres.

Balasubramanian alias Balu (Rajinikanth) is an absent-minded but kind-hearted Tamil college Professor. He lives with his younger brother Raju (Prabhu), his maternal uncle (V. K. Ramaswamy) and his cousin Sumathi (Suhasini), who is also his love interest. Raju, who studies in the same college that Balu works, is short-tempered, rowdyish and a drunkard, spoiled by Balu's and Sumathi's pamperings. He frequently gets into fights with a fellow student Raghupathy (Nassar), whose father owns the college. Balu fails in several attempts to reform Raju. One night, Balu is accidentally killed when he tries to intervene in one of the fights between Raju and Raghupathy. Before dying, Balu asks Raju to ensure that he can find another person who can marry Sumathi as he does not want her to suffer after his death, to which Raju agrees with a heavy heart. Balu's demise marks a turning point for Raju, who vows never to get angry and drink again. Sumathi, who is devastated at Balu's death, goes into depression, dons the garb of a widow and vows never to marry. To ensure that Sumathi gets over Balu, Raju and Sumathi move to Bangalore, where Raju takes up a job at a garage owned by Devi (Kushboo).

One day, Raju encounters his brother's doppelgänger Shankar (Rajinikanth), a rowdy and thief who steals cars daily from the garage. Raju, who still feels guilty over his brother's death, is unable to fight Shankar as he looks like his brother and unsuccessfully tries to develop a bond with him. However, after hearing Raju's and Sumathi's sad story, Shankar undergoes a change of heart and he decides to mend his ways, eventually becoming a police informer. Soon, he falls in love with Sumathi, but Sumathi rebuffs him as she is unable to forget Balu. Meanwhile, Sumathi is kidnapped by a smuggler Bhaskar (Captain Raju), for whom Shankar once used to work, in order to force him to smuggle diamonds. Shankar reluctantly agrees to Bhaskar's demand so that Sumathi would be saved, but when Bhaskar refuses to release Sumathi, a fight ensues between Shankar and Raju on one side and Bhaskar on the other side, which ends with Bhaskar's arrest. Sumathi realises her love for Shankar, and the movie ends with the marriages of both Shankar and Sumathi as well as Raju and Devi, with Shankar dressing up like the late Balu for the marriage.


After "Thai Veedu", Devar Films parted ways with Rajini. All the subsequent films they produced were flops which resulted in heavy losses. Director R. Thyagarajan openly accepted that they had a very good rapport with Rajini for sometime but due to unavoidable circumstances they lost their friendship with Rajini. They accepted that they are responsible for the issue and there's no mistake on Rajini side. Rajini wished to help them and did "Dharmathin Thalaivan" under Dandayudhapani Films banner. "Dharmathin Thalaivan" was the 21st collaboration between Rajinikanth and SP Muthuraman. The film saw Prabhu and Rajini pairing for second time after "Guru Sishyan" (1988). The film marked the debut of actress Kushboo in Tamil films. Kushboo revealed that the film happened "after I met Prabhu at a studio and he recommended my name to the producer" and she also recalled an instance when she struggled to learn and understand Tamil during the shoot.

The music composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The song "Thenmadurai" remains one of the famous songs from the film. The song "Muthamizh Kaviye" is based on Gaurimanohari Raga.

"Dharmathin Thalaivan" became a super hit and paid off all the losses of Devar. However it became the final production of Devar films and after that they left the industry. Indiaglitz wrote: "There was another side to our own Superstar and Dharmathin Thalaivan was a fine example for the same. He did the role of a passionate Tamil teacher with his usual swag".

Guru Sishyan (1988 film)

Guru Sishyan (; ) is a 1988 Indian Tamil-language action comedy film that was directed by S. P. Muthuraman. A remake of the Hindi film "Insaf Ki Pukar" (1987), it stars Rajinikanth, Prabhu, Seetha and Gautami in the lead roles with Pandiyan, Cho Ramaswamy, Ravichandran, Radha Ravi, Senthamarai, Vinu Chakravarthy and Manorama in supporting roles. The film is about two ex-convicts who set out to prove the innocence of their wrongfully imprisoned fellow convict.

Meena Panchu Arunachalam produced "Guru Sishyan" under the production company P. A. Art Productions. The screenplay was written by her husband Panchu Arunachalam. Cinematography was handled by T. S. Vinayagam, the editing was by R. Vittal and C. Lancy, and the art direction was by B. Chalam. The film is Gautami's debut role in Tamil cinema, and the first film in which Rajinikanth and Prabhu co-starred. Filming took place primarily in Mysore and Chennai, and was completed in 25 days.

"Guru Sishyan" was released on 13 April 1988 during the Puthandu (Tamil New Year) holiday. Despite being released at a time of political turmoil in Tamil Nadu after the death of chief minister M. G. Ramachandran months earlier, "Guru Sishyan", which includes many political references, became a commercial success, running in theatres for over 175 days.

Soon-to-be-released convicts Raja and Babu meet Manohar, who is on death row. He tells them his sister Sumathi was kidnapped by a taxi driver and taken to Muthuraaj, a playboy who raped and killed her. Muthuraaj murdered the taxi driver and framed Manohar with his elder brother Rajamanickam, ally Jayaram and a corrupt police inspector Nallasivam. Raja and Babu believe Manohar; Raja stalls his execution by fracturing his left arm. Once released, the two men initiate an elaborate plan.

Posing as CBI officers, Raja and Babu conduct a fake income tax raid in Nallasivam's house in his absence. They discover he has an abundance of illegally earned wealth, and force his wife Kalyani to sign a paper confirming this. Nallasivam learns about the "raid" in his house and threatens to arrest Raja and Babu, but they gain leverage over him, having created numerous copies of the paper.

Raja later falls in love with Geetha, another police inspector. He tells Babu to "romance" Rajamanickam's daughter Chithra as part of the plan, but it backfires. Raja discovers that Geetha is Nallasivam's daughter and lies to her about being a CBI officer. Raja blackmails Nallasivam into helping him infiltrate Muthuraaj's services as a new bodyguard. Babu later genuinely falls in love with Chithra, who reciprocates. Though Raja soon reveals to Geetha the truth about himself and Nallasivam's corrupt nature, she accepts him.

Pressured by Raja, Nallasivam introduces Babu to Rajamanickam as a millionaire who is in love with Chithra; Rajamanickam arranges their marriage. During the ceremony, Babu tells Rajamanickam he knows of the group's crimes and says he will only marry Chithra if the group confess in writing. When Rajamanickam refuses, Babu reveals his true identity and cancels the marriage, telling Chithra her father refused to give him the requested dowry. Rajamanickam, Jayaram and Muthuraaj realise that Nallasivam lied to them, and Babu is trying to help Manohar. They plan revenge.

For over 20 years, Rajamanickam has been trying to uncover a secret that is only known to Kandhasamy, Manohar's father, held captive in his basement. Kandhasamy has amnesia so a rope is used to jolt his memory. It succeeds but Kandhasamy refuses to tell Rajamanickam. Jayaram believes Kandhasamy will only tell Babu because he is helping Manohar. Babu, now their prisoner, is taken to the basement. Raja follows to watch over Babu, and they secretly rescue Kandhasamy and his wife Padma and escape.

While conversing with Padma, Raja realises he is Kandhasamy's first son who went missing years ago during a school trip. Babu identifies Kandhasamy as the murderer of his parents. Kandhasamy reveals the truth: he had learned the location of a treasure cave but wanted to tell only Babu's father, IG Sriram. Rajamanickam imprisoned Kandhasamy and his family to seek the location, but he refused. Rajamanickam then murdered Babu's parents disguised as Kandhasamy, sparing Babu so that he could blame him. The family escaped, and Padma reveals that they were recaptured after Manohar's arrest. Raja swears revenge.

Geetha and Chithra join Raja and Babu in their plan to avenge. Rajamanickam meets Raja and Babu, and at the instigation of Jayaram, agrees to sign a paper incriminating Muthuraaj in exchange for the location to the cave, which will be the "dowry" for Chithra and Babu's marriage. Chithra records Rajamanickam and Jayaram's conversation on tape; she gives it to Muthuraaj, who plans revenge along with Nallasivam.

Kandhasamy, Rajamanickam, Jayaram, Babu and Raja reach the cave and find many gold bars. Rajamanickam signs the paper as promised, but Raja and Babu intend to have him arrested for his crimes. Soon after, Muthuraaj and Nallasivam arrive and create chaos with thugs and bombs; Rajamanickam and Jayaram are killed while Raja, Babu and Kandhasamy escape. Muthuraaj and Nallasivam drive away with many gold bars but are stopped by Raja and Babu, and arrested by Geetha. Manohar, now fully healed, is exonerated.

When filmmaker and writer Panchu Arunachalam was in financial crisis, director S. P. Muthuraman suggested actor Rajinikanth to collaborate with Arunachalam for a film. Rajinikanth agreed and offered to give a call-sheet of 10 days, asking Muthuraman to prepare a story. Muthuraman objected, saying that if Rajinikanth did a "guest role", audience would not accept it and distributors would not buy the film, meaning low chances of profit. Muthuraman asked Rajinikanth to give 25 call-sheet days and said he would finish the film within that time; the average Tamil film then would take 45 days to film.

Muthuraman had seen "Insaf Ki Pukar" (1987), a Hindi film with two heroes. He decided to remake this film in Tamil and told Rajinikanth 25 days was enough. Rajinikanth signed on the film but said he would not act for longer than the given dates. The film was produced by Arunachalam's wife Meena under their own company P. A. Art Productions, while Arunachalam wrote the screenplay. Cinematography was handled by T. S. Vinayagam, editing by R. Vittal and C. Lancy, and art direction was by B. Chalam. Arunachalam's son Subbu Panchu worked as an assistant production manager for the film.

Muthuraman said he made "Guru Sishyan" to exploit Rajinikanth's flair for comedy. Rajinikanth and Prabhu were cast in lead roles as Raja and Babu. This was the first film in which the two actors were seen together onscreen; though they had first acted together in "Dharmathin Thalaivan", it was released later in 1988. Gautami was cast as the police inspector Geetha, one of the other leads; it marked her debut in Tamil cinema. Seetha played Chithra, another lead.

Pandiyan portrayed Raja's brother Manohar. Ravichandran played the antagonist Rajamanickam, deviating from the heroic roles he was previously known for. Cho Ramaswamy portrayed Rajamanickam's advisor Jayaram, and Radha Ravi portrayed Rajamanickam's brother Muthuraaj. Senthamarai appeared as Raja and Manohar's father Kandhasamy, Vinu Chakravarthy as the corrupt police inspector Nallasivam, and Manorama as his wife Kalyani. K. Natraj, LIC Narasimhan, Nagaraja Chozhan, Padmasri, Sudha and K. S. Jayalakshmi appeared in minor roles as the criminal Solomon, Babu's father Sriram, the taxi driver, Kandhasamy's wife Padma, Manohar's sister Sumathi, and the call girl respectively.

Principal photography began with the filming of the song "Jingidi Jingidi" at VGP Universal Kingdom, Chennai. Gautami was initially nervous dancing with Rajinikanth in "Jingidi Jingidi" because it was the first time they acted together so it was decided to film non-dancing scenes for two days then film the dance. Choreographer Puliyur Saroja trained Gauthami, who was able to dance convincingly. Many of the film's scenes were shot in Mysore, as filming in Chennai turned problematic. Initially, the script did not have a fight scene for Prabhu. At Rajinikanth's insistence, the fight scene intended for him was later given to Prabhu. The song "Kandu Pudichen", picturised on Rajinikanth and Gauthami, was shot in a day.

The climactic fight sequence was planned to be filmed in the Borra Caves at Araku Valley, but because Rajinikanth's call-sheet dates were nearing the end and a round-trip to Araku Valley would take longer, Chalam designed an identical cave set in Chennai. The scene in which Raja and Babu escape through a tunnel while being pursued by a rolling boulder was based on a similar scene from "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981). While Rajinikanth had given a call-sheet of 25 days, all his scenes were filmed in 23 days; he stayed for the remaining two days, during which he moved the trolley for the song "Vaa Vaa Vanji", which was picturised on Prabhu and Seetha, and filmed at Brindavan Gardens. The final length of the film is .

Film critic Naman Ramachandran considers the film to have an "overt political message". He, Jeeva Sahapthan of "Patrikai" and writer S. Rajanayagam interpret the scene in which many convicts fight for the chief's chair and Raja sings ""Naatkaalikku Sandai Podum Naamellam Paithiyam Thaanda"" (People who fight for a chair are mad) as a reference to infighting that occurred within the political party All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) following the death of Tamil Nadu chief minister M. G. Ramachandran on 24 December 1987; after his death, the AIADMK was split into two factions. Jeeva Sahapthan notes that Raja's dialogue ""Mike aala pesaradhu andha kaalam, mike aala adikkaradhu indha kaalam"" (Talking through the microphone is old, beating with the microphone is new) references several incidents in which people were beaten with microphones.

A writer from "The Hindu Tamil" using the "nom de plume" "Cinema Pithan" compared "Guru Sishyan" to many other Rajinikanth films from the 1980s like "Polladhavan" (1980), "Moondru Mugam" (1982), "Naan Mahaan Alla" (1984) and "Naan Sigappu Manithan" (1985) because revenge is a mutual theme in them, while other sources identify it as a treasure hunt film in the vein of the "Indiana Jones" films. S. Rajanayagam writes that the scene in which the jailer advises Raja not to visit the jail again, and Raja asks why he should have to come to the jail if those outside are good, mirrors many films in which Rajinikanth's character submits himself to the law and gets punished as a routine but does not generally feel guilty about his petty crimes and is depicted as taking for granted that minor offences are a part of daily living.

Writing for "Firstpost" in 2014, S. Srinivasan said the film says people with "families and reputations and clean linen shirts to protect" should normally "avoid messing up with the poor, who have nothing to lose, or the rich, who can swat us like a fly". In another "Firstpost" article, Apoorva Sripathi noted that the hand gestures Jayaram makes in one scene in which he is in deep thought were actually symbols of the AIADMK, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Indian National Congress. She called this an example of Ramaswamy making references to politics in his films. Film historian Mohan Raman said, "Cho was one person who could spout political dialogues and display his brand of wit ... His comedy in ["Guru Sishyan"] was satire-driven ... maybe because he was essentially a stage actor". Rajanayagam states that "Kandu Pudichen" replaying in part at the film's end signifies a trend in Tamil cinema wherein the last song to be played is usually heard earlier in the film.

The music for "Guru Sishyan" was composed by Ilaiyaraaja. Vaali wrote the lyrics of all songs except "Jingidi Jingidi", which Ilaiyaraaja himself wrote. The soundtrack was released by Echo Records. "Kandu Pudichen" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Shubhapantuvarali. Unlike most Shubhapantuvarali songs, which are composed with melancholic overtones, it was written to be "playful" and "fun". The song attained popularity, as did "Naatkaalikku Sandai" despite its anti-political lyrics, and "Jingidi Jingidi" with its nonsensical lyrics.
"Guru Sishyan" was released on 13 April 1988 during Puthandu, the Tamil New Year holiday, and was distributed by Mangaadu Amman Films. According to trade analyst Sreedhar Pillai, the overseas rights of the film were sold for ; Prathibha Parameswaran of "Scroll.in", however, said the film "did a business of just about a lakh of rupees", its distributor having acquired its overseas rights for .

On 24 April 1988, the review board of the magazine "Ananda Vikatan" praised "Guru Sishyan" for its comedy and Rajinikanth's performance—especially his English malapropisms—giving it a rating of 40 out of 100. N. Krishnaswamy of "The Indian Express" wrote, "Rajinikanth and Prabhu enjoy to the hilt playing their light-hearted roles, lissom newface Gautami and short and square [Seetha] prance around with abandon. [Ilaiyaraaja's] numbers are pleasant and add sparkle to the song-and-dance sequences." Despite being released at a time of political turmoil in Tamil Nadu after M. G. Ramachandran's death, the film became a commercial success, running in theatres for over 175 days, thereby becoming a silver jubilee film.

"Guru Sishyan" brought Gautami to instant stardom. Many of Rajinikanth's English malapropisms such as "Es-kiss me" or "Yes kiss me" instead of "Excuse me", "underwear" instead of "understand", "jaundice" instead of "justice", and "ABC" instead of "CBI" gained popularity, as did the scene where Raja and Babu conduct a fake income tax raid. S. Rajanayagam wrote that the imaging of Rajinikanth's politics can be seen in four phases, where the second covers "the period from "Guru Sishyan" (1988) to (1995)". Naman Ramachandran noted that after the release of "Guru Sishyan", "overt political commentary would become increasingly common in Rajinikanth's films". "Guru Sishyan" was later screened at Chennai's AGS Cinemas on 27 September 2010 as part of their "Rajnikanth Film Festival".

In his review of "Sundhara Travels" (2002), S. R. Ashok Kumar of "The Hindu" compared Vinu Chakravarthy's comical police character to Nallasivam. The 2010 film "Guru Sishyan", directed by Sakthi Chidambaram, has a different storyline from its 1988 namesake. Sakthi Chidambaram said, "the story demanded such a title, we short-listed 50 titles, finally decided we could use the old one". In "Enkitta Mothathe" (2017), "Naatkaalikku Sandai" plays in a theatre where, at the same time, there is a scuffle between Ravi (Natarajan Subramaniam) and Mandhramoorthy (Radha Ravi) on who is bigger.

Dosti Dushmani

Dosti Dushmani (English: "Friendship - Enmity") is a 1986 Bollywood Action drama film, produced and directed by Tatineni Rama Rao under the Srinath Productions banner. It stars Jeetendra, Rajinikanth, Rishi Kapoor, Poonam Dhillon, Kimi Katkar, Bhanupriya in the pivotal roles and music composed by Laxmikant–Pyarelal. The film was a remake of the Telugu movie "Mugguru Mitrulu" (1985) which was also remade in Kannada as "Brahma Vishnu Maheshwara".

Dr. Sandeep Kumar (Jeetendra), Inspector Ranjith (Rajinikanth) and Advocate Prakash (Rishi Kapoor) have been the best of friends since childhood. The three of them were raised by Sandeep's parents (Pran & Shavukar Janaki), who adopted Prakash as an orphan and took in Ranjith, who was abandoned by his smuggler father Daga (Amrish Puri) for being too honest, fleeing with his mother and sister instead. Ranjith is an honest police officer, Sandeep is a well-known doctor in the city, and Prakash is a leading criminal lawyer. The three of them often come into clashes with Daga, who has become a big gangster and doesn't know that Ranjith is his son. Ranjith and Prakash always quarrel with Sandeep, who has a problem of being very short-tempered, unable to withhold himself if he witnesses injustice being done to someone. One day one of Daga's gang (Guru Bachan) kidnapped and raped Ranjith's pregnant wife Lata (Poonam Dhillon). The incident was witnessed by Sandeep, and he rescued Lata by beating up the rapist. For her protection, Sandeep made Lata promise not to reveal the rape to anyone. Daga took advantage of the situation and killed the rapist, hoping to frame Sandeep as the killer. Ranjith arrested Sandeep and Prakash took up the case in his defence.

Viduthalai ("") is a 1986 Tamil action film, directed by K. Vijayan. It stars Sivaji Ganesan, Rajinikanth and Vishnuvardhan in the lead roles. The film was an average hit and received mixed reviews at the box office. It is a remake of the 1980 movie "Qurbani", which itself was based on the 1972 Italian movie "The Master Touch".

Raja (Rajinikanth), an expert thief is in love with Radha (Madhavi), a disco club dancer-cum-singer, who is unaware of Raja's profession. Meanwhile, an evil brother-sister duo, Vikram (Vijayakumar) and Bhairavi (Anuradha) is bent on seeking vengeance from Crime boss Sudharshan, who cheated and siphoned Bhairavi's money. The duo hire Raja to break into Sudarshan's treasury and perform the heist. But he was caught by a jovial-cum-shrewd Inspector Rajasingam (Sivaji Ganesan) and awarded 2 years imprisonment, which shocks and devastates Radha.

On the other hand, Amar (Vishnuvardhan) is an ace crime member in Sudarshan's gang who revolts against Sudarshan. He is a widower with a daughter (Shalini) who is studying in a boarding school. However, before quitting Sudarshan's gang, Amar has committed a crime wearing a mask and Inspector Rajasingam is investigating that case. Once Amar saves Radha from a gang of rowdy bikers. They meet regularly as Radha likes Amar's daughter. Soon Amar begins to love Radha, who does not reciprocate because she still loves Raja. Amar realizes Radha is not interested and does not proceed. Raja completes his jail sentence. While returning, he meets the Vikram, who again reminds him of the deal to rob Sudarshan. During the conversation, Amar incidentally reaches the site and a fist fight ensues between Amar and the Vikram. While fleeing, Vikram swears revenge against Amar. Thus Raja and Amar meet for the first time. Raja takes Amar to introduce to Radha, but both Radha and Amar pretend as if they do not know each other since they don't want Raja to unnecessarily suspect them.

Later Vikram's goons kidnap Amar's daughter and beat Amar who is hospitalized. In return for Amar and his daughter's safety, Raja agrees to do Vikram's job. He nurses Amar back to normal and soon they turn thick friends. Amar promises Raja he will support him in this one last robbery. They plan to shift to London after the robbery with the money. They concoct a scheme whereby Amar would steal gold bars and jewellery from a safe, then phone the police, let Raja take over, get arrested, get a prison term for about 12 to 18 months. After his release, he will join Amar in the U.S.A. Things go awry as Raja gets arrested for killing Sudarshan while Amar and Radha reach U.S.A with the money. Raja construes that Amar deliberately framed him so that he can get Raja out of the way, and keep all the money (as well as Radha) for himself. Raja escapes from jail and reaches London to apprehend Amar. After a brief tussle between the two, Raja realizes the truth and that Amar did not frame him. Vikram and his goons reach U.S.A to take revenge against Raja and Amar. During the ensuing fight, Amar sacrifices his life to save Raja from getting killed by Vikram.


Balaji, who saw Hindi film "Qurbani" decided to remake it in Tamil. He wanted Rajini to play Feroz Khan's character and Sivaji to play Amjad Khan's character. Sivaji agreed to play the role. The dialogue for the film was written by Aaroor Das.

The soundtrack was composed by Chandrabose. Lyrics were by Vaali and Pulamaipithan. The song "Neela Kuyilgal Rendu" became a classic from its release.

Mr. Bharath

Mr. Bharath is a 1986 Indian Tamil-language drama film directed by S. P. Muthuraman. The film stars Rajinikanth, Sathyaraj, Ambika, Goundamani, S. V. Shekhar and others. The film which was a remake of Hindi film "Trishul" revolves around a son's revenge against his father for cheating on his mother. This film was dubbed in Telugu as "Nene Rajinikanth" and remade with the same title and starring Sobhan Babu. The movie was declared a hit at the box office.

Bharath (Rajinikanth) is a young, educated man, unaware on the whereabouts of his father. Shanti, (Sharada) his mother tells him the past about his father, but, on her deathbed.

Flashback: A young Gopinath (Sathyaraj), suave, educated and a rich man, arrives Paarapatti village (where then-young Shanti resides), for engineering a construction project. Over time, he slowly gains her interest, for her being an innocent village girl she was, working under him as a manual construction labour under his unit, by emulating innocence. Smitten, she, in turn, entrusts him, wherein he takes the fullest advantage over her. After the construction work Gopinath was engineering for, finished the final stage, he goes about to move out of the Paarapatti. Getting to know his departure, Shanti runs into him. Gopinath justifies her that he would return soon to take over her arms which convinces Shanti as she waved him off gleefully. Weeks passed, Shanti, self-acquiesced she's conceived, eagerly and desperately awaiting Gopinath to return expecting the promise he lent, be fulfilled, hears from fellow villagers that he was about to get wed to another rich woman. Shocked, she travels to Madras with the help of the visiting card that Gopinath had given her earlier to meet him. They both have a furious heads-up after Gopinath, who not only portrayed his original ill-natured attire but expressed a denial too — indicating the difference in their stature and her archaic-in-nature, to accept her. Also stating she had no proof regarding intimacy that made her conceive, berates her a 'gold-digger'. Become aware of the innocence as a cloak that he used for exploiting her, which he himself admits at the end, exasperates Shanti furiously. An insulted Shanti swore him that one day her child will question him on the future of his vile actions and make him forcibly confess the truth about his depraved activity in front of the whole society and departs. Over the course of time, Shanti faces hardships and raises her son to be what he becomes as now not revealing her past until her last hour. 

Back to the Present, She makes Bharath promise to fulfil her challenge before last breath. Bharath, anguished having lost his mother, takes up her vow as a challenge of making his biological father confess the truth within next year 31 August, the day he lost his mother, at her first remembrance.

Bharath leaves for the city and meets his biological father, Gopinath, as some strange man not revealing his true, real identity. After a business dealing, Bharath uses a brilliant, yet criminal strategy, to extricate money out of Gopinath which he uses as an investment to start his own business by venturing into the construction sector and rises to No 2 company within months keeping Gopinath's construction company, 'Gopinath constructions', which was the No.1 company in the same field, as his target. This angers Gopinath, as a result of which, Gopinath views Bharath as a strategic business enemy. Both Bharath and Gopinath try to overtake each other in an illegitimate way. Bharath however, hardworking and brilliant, also with the help of Sanjeevi (Goundamani), his local trustee, out cuts all chances and goes to make his company outrank Gopinath constructions to No.2 thus, becoming No 1.

Later Bharath once helps a girl from goons and takes to her home only to find out that the girl is Pushpa, Gopinath's daughter who happens to be his step-sister. Due to this, Bharath wins the affection of Mrs. Gopinath (Who happens to be Bharath's stepmother) who starts to treat her like her own son, similar to Pushpa's brother. Bharath tactically arranges for a marriage of Pushpa with the son of a wealthy man Kumeresa Gounder on 31 August, the first remembrance of his mother. Kumaresa Goundar fully is made aware of Bharath's swearing, so he too helps him to fulfil the challenge which he has against Gopinath. Bharath also uses the love connection between his rich born step-brother and austere Sanjeevi's sister to corner status-minded Gopinath by arranging the marriage on the same 31 August. Bharath uses every possible way to torture Gopinath to make him realise his mistake but Gopinath does not reciprocate instead becomes angrier as things go beyond business to personal vengeance. Bharath tactically makes various bottlenecks for Gopinath on Aug-31st, as Gopinath comes to realise that there is more than business Bharath was taking this plight into.

Having lost his clutch with business, wealth and status, Gopinath slowly goes into bankruptcy thus unable to afford to his own children' wedding. In the meanwhile, Bharath invites him to inaugurate his orphanage on 31 August, the date when he planned to fulfil his mother's wish. Gopinath, furious with Bharath since he is the reason for his slump, hires a local goon Michael (Raghuvaran) who once was his enemy (also Bharath's) and proposes to kill Bharath at his own inaugural function on the same 31 August. Bharath reveals his mother's identity in the function as he waits for Gopinath to accept his mistake.

Does Gopinath recognise who Bharath is and whether he accepts him as his son frames the end of the story.


Sathyaraj acted as Rajinikanth's father in the film though he was in fact 4 years younger to Rajinikanth.

The music was composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The track "Ennama Kannu" was later remixed in the film "Thiruvilayadal Arambam" (2006). The song inspired a 2000 film of same name also starring Sathyaraj.

"Mr Bharath" got terrific openings at the box office. The film was appreciated for Rajini's style of tackling Sathyaraj but the critics gave it a thumbs down for tampering the original script of Trishul and miscasting of Sathyaraj and S. Ve. Sekar in the roles of Sanjeev Kumar and Shashi Kapoor. Rajini's stardom saved the film from becoming flop to making it a 100-day run in few centres.

Bhagwaan Dada

Bhagwaan Dada is a 1986 Hindi-language Indian feature film about a criminal who becomes morally redeemed through his love for a child. "Bhagwaan Dada" was directed by J. Om Prakash and stars Rajinikanth, Rakesh Roshan, Sridevi, Tina Munim, Paresh Rawal and Danny Denzongpa. Director J Om Prakash's grandson and Rakesh Roshan's son Hrithik Roshan also appears in a pivotal role. This was Hrithik Roshan's last film as a child actor after previously making brief appearances in "Aasha" (1980) and "Aap Ke Deewane" (1980). 14 years later, he made his debut as an adult in "Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai". The movie was dubbed in Tamil as "Agni Karangal".

A villager who is new to the big city – Bhagwaan (Rajinikanth) – turns to crime to avoid starvation. He is drawn into the gang of slum crime lord "dada" Shambu (Danny Denzongpa) where he falls into every crime but one: violence against women. When an impoverished but honourable young widow hangs herself after being raped by Shambu Dada, the cries of her orphaned baby awaken Bhagwaan's soul. He rebels against his former master. Bhagwaan vows to atone for his formerly evil life, and adopts the orphaned baby as his own son. The innocent young boy becomes Bhagwaan's source of personal redemption and the inspiration for all that he does.

12 years later the man now lovingly hailed as "Bhagwaan Dada" has transformed the former crime-ridden slum into a safe and happy neighbourhood – Shantinagar – where his adopted son Govinda (Hrithik Roshan) has become the pride and joy of the whole community. Despite his own dark past, this loving father has worked hard to raise the boy as a good person with sound moral values.

At this time, Bhagwaan chances to rescue another naïve young man new to the big city – Swaroop (Rakesh Roshan) – when Shambu Dada's gang steal all Swaroop's money. Impressed with Swaroop's education as well as the similarity of situation to his own arrival in the city years before, Bhagwaan takes the "innocent and simple" villager under his protective wing. He arranges a good job, even brings Swaroop home to live with himself and his son, young Govinda. Swaroop and Bhagwaan claim each other as "brothers".

One day on a roadway nearby the district, members of Shambu Dada's gang assault a beautiful young woman whom Shambu lusts after. Swaroop hears her cries for help and tries to rescue her, believing as Bhagwaan does that: "It is every man's duty to honour and protect women." But Swaroop is a gentle bookish soul who does not know how to fight. He is badly beaten by Shambu's men before Bhagwaan can rescue him in turn. The young woman (Sridevi) who gives her name as Bijli insists on tending the wounded Swaroop who bravely tried to help her. Bhagwaan invites Bijli to come live at their house until she can find a place to stay. After some initial confusion when Govinda mistakes Bijli for his new 'uncle' Swaroop's wife, all four of them – Bhagwaan, Govinda, Swaroop, and now Bijli – live happily in Bhagwaan's modest home, Govinda remaining impishly determined to matchmake between Swaroop and Bijli.

However, what neither Bhagwaan nor Swaroop realise is that Bijli is a streetwalker.

Intercepted on her way out to work one evening, Bijli spills Bhagwaan a yarn about how she is secretly an undercover policewoman assigned to pose as a prostitute to arrest real prostitutes and their patrons. Bhagwaan believes her. He preserves her "secret", and all four continue happily in the house just as before, ignorance being bliss.

The audience soon learn, though, that appearances are deceiving: Bijli is not, actually, a sex worker but rather working a fraud scam wherein she bilks potential "johns" of money through clever ruses.

Meanwhile, Shambu Dada has sworn revenge against Bhagwaan for foiling his plan to abduct Bijli. After brutally beating to death one of his gang members who botched the abduction, Shambu dumps the corpse in Bhagwaan's territory seeking to frame Bhagwaan for the murder.

The honest policeman Inspector Vijay (Paresh Rawal), though, is fully aware of Shambu Dada's crime empire activities as well as Bhagwaan's reformation. When Bhagwaan discovers the corpse and duly reports the murder, Inspector Vijay not only fails to arrest Bhagwaan but even introduces Bhagwaan to a newspaper reporter – Madhu (Tina Munim) – who is researching crime trends in the city, and recommends that she visit Shantinagar.

The street-savvy Bhagwaan helps Inspector Vijay set a trap that allows the police to capture Shambu Dada in possession of the murder weapon. Shambu is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. All seems well.

Bhagwaan invites Madhu to attend a joyous public celebration in Shantinagar. When young Govinda mischievously invites Bijli to garland his "uncle" Swaroop, we discover that the blushing Swaroop hides a growing attraction to Bijli.

When Madhu reciprocates Bhagwaan's invitation by inviting him and Swaroop to her birthday party at a fancy hotel, Bijli manages to talk her way along. After Bijli's comically jealous behaviour at the party, she confesses how she has come to love Swaroop, just as he loves her. She tries to explain that no future is possible between them. But Swaroop, ecstatic at learning his feelings are returned, simply won't listen.

Unknown to all, however, the evil Shambu Dada has escaped during transfer between prison facilities. Shambu vows to revenge himself upon Bhagwaan at all costs.

While warning Bhagwaan of his danger at Shambu's escape, Inspector Vijay happens to mention that Bijli is not, in fact, working for the police at all but has actually been arrested, if released, on suspicion of prostitution. Bhagwaan angrily confronts Bijli. Devastated, Bijli humbly confesses she lied about working with the police. Bhagwaan strikes her and throws her out of the house … and the whole neighbourhood. When Swaroop returns home he wants to support Bijli but it is already too late: Bijli is gone.

All now seems lost for our lovers.

But wait! A chance encounter with a doctor at a local hospital reveals Bijli's true story: she has nobly sacrificed her reputation to raise money for the surgery and medicines needed to save the life of her sole surviving relative, a little sister, after the rest of their entire family were killed outright during the Bhopal Disaster. [1984 – cyanide gas cloud]

Abjectly chastened, Bhagwaan and Swaroop comb the city for the missing Bijli, and almost abandon all hope.

Swaroop finally discovers "Bijli" – whose real name is now revealed as Geeta – at the hospital. The lovers are reconciled. Bhagwaan begs Geeta to claim him as her brother. He pledges himself to both pay for the little sister's operation and see his "sister" Geeta married happily to Swaroop at the earliest opportunity.

Swaroop's mother comes to welcome Geeta and bless Bhagwaan and Govinda – who is jubilant that his "matchmaking" efforts succeeded – for their role in getting her son married. Geeta's little sister's operation is successful, so she also joins the household. The whole of Shantinagar eagerly helps with preparations for the upcoming wedding.

Madhu, who is herself becoming romantically interested with Bhagwaan, comes to Shantinagar on the day before the big event "to help with wedding work." Govinda persuades Madhu to help him distribute the last of the wedding cards throughout the community.

Hours later Bhagwaan becomes alarmed to discover that neither Govinda nor Madhu has come back.

Some distance beyond the end of the city Bhagwaan comes across an exhausted and terrified Madhu, who explains how both she and Govinda had been kidnapped by the gang of the fugitive Shambu Dada and taken to a ruined fort hidden in the wilderness. Shambu intended to rape her, but brave young Govinda had attacked Shambu so that she could escape, asking her to "Bring Father" for help.

Deeper in the wilderness Bhagwaan finally finds little Govinda, who has been horribly mutilated and left to die. Govinda explains in a failing voice how he succeeded in overcoming Shambu's gang with the fighting skills his father taught him, but was unable to defeat Shambu himself. Shambu then vented his rage, at being cheated of Madhu, by brutally crushing Govinda's legs – "There were nails in his shoes, Father ..." – leaving the boy paralysed and bleeding to death.

After receiving final blessing, Govinda dies in his father's arms ... having sacrificed his own all-too-short life to save the life of another.

As darkness falls in the wilderness, Bhagwaan tenderly burns his son's remains.

Bhagwaan solemnly vows to be avenged upon Shambu, and binds Madhu to silence regarding Govinda's murder lest the wedding be interrupted.

The wedding of Geeta and Swaroop goes forward, attended by the whole of Shantinagar. But part way through the ceremonies someone discovers that they're missing the sindoor (vermilion) needed to fill the bride's hair parting for the ritual. Bhagwaan rushes off to buy the essential sindoor.

Shambu confronts Bhagwaan in the marketplace. They fight bitterly, until Bhagwaan at last overwhelms Shambu. Remembering poor Govinda's last words, Bhagwaan dons one of Shambu's horrible nail-studded boots and uses it to finish off Shambu. Or so he thinks. At the very last, the dying Shambu manages to hurl a hidden knife that pierces Bhagwaan's chest.

Knowing himself to be mortally wounded, Bhagwaan returns to the wedding just at the point where the ceremony requires him, as the bride's brother, to bless the newly wedded couple – which he does, using a smear of his own red blood instead of the hard-won sindoor. Geeta and Swaroop now realise he is injured and dying, also that Govinda, too, is missing. Bhagwaan responds that he is "on his way to join Govinda" ... and dies in their arms in his turn.

Swaroop and Geeta pledge to continue Bhagwaan's legacy at Shantinagar.


Rajesh Roshan composed five songs penned by Farooq Kaiser and Indeevar. Two of them, "Tujhse Pehle Bematlab Thi Zindagi" and "Aaya Pyar Ka Zamana", were hits.

The film was directed by Rakesh's father-in-law J. Om Prakash, but during his sickness, Rakesh Roshan himself had directed some portion of the film. It was a major flop as the presentation of the story was very poor. One or two songs of the film became little popular.

The movie is a remake of 1984 Hindi movie "Aaj Ki Awaaz" which itself was loosely based on the 1974 American action film "Death Wish" which was earlier remade in Telugu as "Nyayam Meere Cheppali" (where Rajnikanth played the role of the police inspector) and later remade in Kannada as "Mahatma". Vijay played a child artist role in this film shortly.

Vijay (Rajinikanth) is a Tamil professor living with his widowed mother and his sister. He is in love with Uma (Ambika), a lawyer. During a visit to his friend Ravi's (Nizhalgal Ravi) house, he is disgusted by goings-on in his neighborhood. Illicit liquor is being sold at a tea-stall while prostitution is flourishing in another house in the same colony. But his complaints to the police, yield nothing since the policeman is on the villains' payroll and manages to warn them before making a raid. When Ravi's sister is raped and killed and the perpetrator Mohanraj (Sathyaraj) gets off scot-free with help from a minister, Vijay and Ravi take matters into their own hands and clean up the tea-stall and brothel on their own. Wanting to teach Vijay a lesson, Mohanraj and his goondas rape his sister (who then commits suicide) and kill his mother. Vijay then turns into a vigilante, walking the streets at nights and dealing out his own brand of justice - shoot first and ask questions later - to the rowdies and goondas. He soon becomes known as Robin Hood, helper of the poor and the police sends Singaaram (Bhagyaraj), a CID officer to unmask Robin Hood.
Vijay kills Mohanraj and his uncle. Now Vijay surrenders to Singaram revealing the truth but Singaram mentions that he has already found the truth and decided not to arrest Vijay as he cleans up the society. But Vijay feels guilty for his murders and surrenders to police. Uma appears in court in favour of Vijay and argues. The day before the judgment, Singaram masks as a criminal and tries to molest the judge's daughter, seeing which the judge tries to shoot the criminal. Now Singaram reveals his identity and mentions that his intention was to make the judge understand that Vijay was also under similar situation before. Finally the judge sentences Vijay for lifetime imprisonment but recommends to the president of India for granting a pardon.


"Naan Sigappu Manithan" is based on the American film "Death Wish" (1974) and its sequel "Death Wish II" (1982). According to "Jump Cut", one factor that differentiates "Naan Sigappu Manithan" from those films is the "unleashing of nationalist angst in a climactic courtroom drama scene".

Nallavanukku Nallavan

Nallavanukku Nallavan () is a 1984 Tamil-language Indian action drama film, directed by S. P. Muthuraman. Produced by M. Saravanan and M. Balasubramanian of AVM Productions, the film stars Rajinikanth and Raadhika in the lead roles, with Karthik, Thulasi, V. K. Ramasamy, Major Sundarrajan, Y. G. Mahendran and Visu in supporting roles. It is a remake of the 1983 Telugu film "Dharmaatmudu". In "Nallavanukku Nallavan", a rogue-turned factory worker is left in charge of his late industrialist boss's business. The industrialist's son believes he swindled his father's business and seeks revenge.

The screenplay of "Nallavanukku Nallavan" was written by Visu, who made minor changes to differentiate it from the Telugu original, which Saravanan noticed was too similar to the unsuccessful Tamil film "Hitler Umanath" (1982). The film was released on 22 October 1984, Diwali day. It was a commercial success, running for over 150 days in theatres. For his performance, Rajinikanth won numerous awards, including the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil.

Manickam is a well-meaning rogue. Uma, an orphaned woman, enters his house for safety from criminals who were chasing her. After he saves her from other criminals, he learns that she is a missing woman and drops her at her house. But upon seeing the abusive nature of her uncle Sadhasivam and his son Anand, he saves her and they marry. Manickam promises Uma he will not engage in violence, and surrenders to police inspector Azhagarsamy for his earlier acts.

Manickam is released from prison in time to see his newborn daughter Priya. Gangadharan, a friend of Azhagarsamy, gives Manickam employment at his factory, Victory Industries. When Gangadharan becomes bankrupt, he plans to close Victory Industries as he is unable to repay his debts to money lenders. Manickam persuades him to give him a chance to revive it and with hard efforts he repays all debts. As a token of gratitude, Gangadharan gives all his wealth to Manickam before dying.

Several years later, Manickam has been running Victory Industries to everyone's satisfaction. He also controls the financial affairs of Gangadharan's family. But Gangadharan's spoilt son Vinod is not on good terms with Manickam, who he believes swindled his father's business. Vinod tries to avenge Manickam by luring Priya. He brainwashes and marries her, much to the agony of Manickam and Uma, and Priya becomes estranged from them. Uma later dies of cardiac arrest. Manickam donates all his wealth and properties to Vinod, and tells him that he did not swindle his father's business.

Sadhasivam and Anand later try to kill Vinod so that they can usurp his wealth. Priya informs Manickam of this, so he arrives and defeats Sadhasivam's thugs, saving Vinod in the process, while his friend Thakkali ties up Sadhasivam to be taken by the police. Manickam makes amends with Vinod and Priya, and plans to return to his old house, but is dissuaded by Priya, who reveals she is pregnant with Vinod's child.


After watching the Telugu film "Dharmaatmudu" (1983), director A. C. Tirulokchandar told M. Saravanan of AVM Productions about his desire to remake it in Tamil; he wanted Rajinikanth to play the male lead. However, Tirulokchandar dropped the effort after producer K. Balaji, who also saw "Dharmaatmudu", felt Rajinikanth was not suitable. Saravanan and others saw "Dharmaatmudu", and noticed how similar it was to the Tamil film "Hitler Umanath" (1982). Screenwriter Panchu Arunachalam objected to remaking "Dharmaatmudu" since "Hitler Umanath" was unsuccessful, but Saravanan and director S. P. Muthuraman knew there was something responsible for the "Dharmaatmudu"s success. They called Visu who, after watching the film, said it could be remade well with minor changes. He was soon finalised as the screenwriter for the remake which was titled "Nallavanukku Nallavan". The film was produced by Saravanan and his brother M. Balasubramanian, with M. S. Guhan receiving an "associate producer" credit. Babu was hired for cinematography, and R. Vittal for editing.

Rajinikanth was cast Manickam and Raadhika as Uma, while Karthik was cast as Vinod. He was not initially interested in portraying a negative character, but after Saravanan promised to cast him in a heroic role in a later film (which would become 1985's "Nalla Thambi"), he agreed. Thulasi was cast as Manickam and Uma's daughter Priya, Y. G. Mahendran as Manickam's friend Thakkali, and screenwriter Visu as Vinod's father Gangadharan. Supporting roles were played by V. K. Ramasamy and Major Sundarrajan, while Kalpana Iyer appeared as a dancer in the song "Vechukkava". This song was shot on a set resembling a five-star hotel with 200 television sets used. The song "Unnaithane" was intended to be shot at Kerala, but could not due to heavy rain there. Instead, it was shot at Muttukaadu due to its atmosphere resembling that of Kerala.

The climax was initially very sentimental and, according to Saravanan, a "poetic finish". While watching the double positive, he was dissatisfied since "Nallavanukku Nallavan" was primarily an action film and felt a gentle climax would not be suitable. Both Rajinikanth and Muthuraman preferred the sentimental climax, but Saravanan remained adamant. The film was already cleared by the Censor Board with the sentimental climax, but it was decided to reshoot the film with an action-packed climax and submit that too to the Board, then decide which one to keep based on audience reactions. The audience preferred the action-packed climax, and it was retained.

S. Rajanayagam, author of "Popular Cinema and Politics in South India: The Films of MGR and Rajinikanth", notes that Rajinikanth tries through his films to convey the message that he becomes a Tamilian by marital alliance, citing "Nallavanukku Nallavan" as an example. S. P. Muthuraman has stated that the film shows two polarising personalities of Manickam: the first half of the film has "commercial" elements and shows him as a "dada"; the second half shows him as a "rich man". Rajanayagam and film critic Naman Ramachandran note that the scene where Gangadharan asks Manickam if he has heard about a bus conductor who became a superstar through hard work, is a reference to Rajinikanth's early life as a bus conductor before he became an actor.

The soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja, with Na. Kamarasan, Vairamuthu, Gangai Amaran, Muthulingam and Vaali working as lyricists. The song "Unnaithane", written by Vairamuthu, was originally intended for a film to be directed by V. C. Guhanathan, but could not be used there. After obtaining a No Objection Certificate from Guhanathan, Saravanan was able to use the song in "Nallavanukku Nallavan".

Gangvaa

Gangvaa is a 1984 Hindi film directed by Rajasekhar. The movie starring Rajinikanth, Shabana Azmi and Suresh Oberoi in lead roles. It was a Hit in Hindi. It is a remake of the 1983 Tamil film "Malaiyoor Mambattiyan" that starred Thyagarajan and Saritha in the lead roles.

The basic injustice at the core of "Gangvaa" is the way the landed classes take advantage of ordinary village folk. Early on in the film, a work crew finds a pot full of gold coins, and a suitably mustache-twirling zamindar (Amrish Puri) confiscates them to add to his already massive wealth. Enter Gangvaa (Rajnikanth) to save the day; Gangvaa kills Zamindar and his goons. Gangvaa puts together a band of the men who had suffered under the Zamindar's tyranny. Together they hang out in the wilderness and perform Robin-Hood-esque raids for the sake of vigilante justice. At some point Jamna (Shabana Azmi) encounters Gangvaa and is smitten. Then a village girl accuses Gangvaa of rape, and Jamna is enraged – it is here that she gets down to find the truth. It turns out that the rape was actually done by a totally different guy named Gangvaa (Raza Murad), and righting this wrong wins Jamna back for our hero, but makes him a new set of enemies that he spends the rest of the film fleeing from. Also on his tail is a police inspector (Suresh Oberoi), who cannot allow vigilante justice in his district, no matter how noble the intention.

Anbulla Rajinikanth

Anbulla Rajinikanth () is a 1984 Indian Tamil-language drama film directed by K. Natraj in his debut. The film stars Rajinikanth as himself, Meena, and Ambika. It was released on 2 August 1984, and received positive reviews, with praise for Meena's performance and Rajinikanth's acting.

Rosy, a girl with a left arm paralysed and weak cardiac health, lives at an orphanage (Karunai Illam) along with others that were dumped by their parents due to disabilities or having no parents, or for other reasons. The fact that she had been disowned by her parents for untold reasons since her birth and her disability to be like other normal children attributes to her rudeness, being uncaring and ignorant towards anyone. She even ill-treats all her caretakers in the orphanage, which leads to hatefulness towards her by almost all other orphanage workers and orphan children, except the kind Mother Superior, who heads the Karunai Illam. Mother Superior is always kind to everyone and tries to tether love and sex to everyone, regardless of one's age. It is at the beginning of the movie, that it is shown that Mother Superior consults doctors, but why, isn't shown. Lalitha arrives at Karunai Illam as a babysitter. She is assigned to take care of Rosy by Mother Superior. She, unlike any other caretakers, takes care of Rosy despite her rudeness and shows extra care for her like a real mother herself, which even surprises Mother Superior as the older caretakers gave up and sidelined when it came to taking care of Rosy, owing to her arrogance.

It is informed that actor Rajinikanth would one day visit the orphanage as a guest to entertain children on a special occasion under the permission of Mother Superior, who thought it would be a good chance to bring change to everyone in the orphanage. Rajinikanth arrives and gives a speech and distributes sweets to every little child and staff kindly, and everyone receives it with pleasure. But when Rajini's turn came to Rosy, she, as usual, emulates her hatred, which turns even bizarre when she smashes Rajini's gifts into his face. While this infuriates everyone around, even children, Rajini imbibes ignominy caused by the little girl Rosy's behaviour, since her being a child and still continues being calm and positive. To rejuvenate happiness, he announces he will freely showcase his newly released film "Annai Oru Aalayam". Rosy however not only earned everyone's disgust for her actions, but on the inside also feels saddened that she herself did this, which even made her more grumpy.

Later that night, Rosy, as usual, stayed isolated from the film screening that was shown as promised by Rajinikanth. But she, however, got interested in the movie hearing it over the window. After a glimpse of a few scenes of it from her window, she goes on to watch the whole movie, wherein the hero of it saves a baby elephant from poachers and re-unites it with its mother elephant displaying parental love, which affects Rosy in terms of sentiments that makes her want to apologize for her unkind acts. Next day, she displays a change, to everyone's awe. She apologises to Rajinikanth through a letter, saying that this film was the reason for her to change her perspective towards her nature, which Rajinikanth swiftly agrees to and replies to her, reciprocating his kindness. Having found herself to have become a bigger fan of Rajinikanth, Rosy obsesses about her favourite superstar-uncle as she would love to call him. Mother Superior, happy on this change of Rosy, requests to Rajinikanth herself, to which Rajinikanth kindly obliges.

Rajinikanth again returns one day and sets up a little drama with K. Bhagyaraj, obliging for Mother Superior's request to please the kids. There he and his young little fan, Rosy, bond with each other, which extends to limits where Rajinikanth takes Rosy almost everywhere, even to his shoots of new films considering the little child Rosie's love for him as to reciprocate it. One day, while having a fun time with Rosie at the illam, in front of Rajinikanth, Rosie coughs up blood then faints. This panics everyone playing around, and soon the doctor is consulted. The doctor comes to become aware that Rosie has a weak heart and she has just a few days left to live, reveals it – and this shocks Lalitha and Rajinikanth himself. Rajinikanth vows to keep his little fan happy for the rest of her life and approaches senior doctors for help. While Ambika confronts Mother Superior in private regarding this, she reveals she is the real mother of Rosie. She had to dump Rosie due to unnatural reasons because of her family and loss of her husband Raju. She interrogates Mother Superior as to why she did not tell her about this. Mother Superior reveals she was aware of this condition, Rosy has had and consulted doctors (shown earlier in the beginning) earlier than Rosie was even able to speak as a child, only to know the problem could not be eradicated by modern medical amenities, but only be cured by god and his grace himself.

Knowing that Rosy was reaching the end of her life, Mother Superior seeks the help of Rosy's idol – Rajnikanth, so that she finds solace in him that she remains happy, let alone the fact of how long she would survive. Rosie demands Rajinikanth once to come and celebrate Christmas as Santa, such that no-one realises. On Christmas Eve, Rajini does as Rosy's wish, soon after which he reveals himself. Overjoyed, Rosy laughs so hard out of happiness, she once again coughed up blood and faints in front of everyone in the middle of a happy occasion. Realizing that night was her last, everyone gathers around crying, especially Rosy's friends, who started to like her ever since the change in her attitude, (after Rajnikanth's arrival) that they were going to miss her forever. On that sad moment, she also reveals, that she was aware that Ambika was her real mother, which makes everyone go into shock. Holding her idol's hand, Rosy dies. It is later shown, Rajinikanth paying tribute to his little fan and he sadly leaves Karunai illam in the memory of the cute little girl that changed because of him, Rosy.

Ek Chalis Ki Last Local

Ek Chalis Ki Last Local (English: "Last Local of 1:40") is a 2007 Indian Hindi crime comedy film directed by Sanjay Khanduri, starring Abhay Deol opposite Neha Dhupia in lead roles. The film released on 18 May 2007, and received positive critical response upon its release. It has been referred to as a cult classic in Bollywood cinema.

The story revolves around two people who miss the last local train at 1:40 am and how it changes the course of their lives forever. The protagonist Nilesh (Abhay Deol) works in a call centre firm cultivated by the IT industry. Night shifts, booze, after office parties seem to be the order of the day. When Nilesh misses his last train from Kurla to Vikroli, he is rudely shoved off by a police constable who wants to keep the station clean from anti-social elements. Nowhere to go, he strolls outside for an auto-rickshaw, where he bumps into a beautiful damsel in distress, Madhu (Neha Dhupia), also wanting a ride to Vikhroli. As it turns out, the rickshaws are on strike due to a bomb blast earlier in the day at Ghatkopar. Nilesh and Madhu are forced to walk to the next rickshaw stand.

Nilesh stops by a local pub and is unable to resist his temptation to have a drink or two. He meets an old friend, Pat, who appears to have amassed a lot of money within a year through gambling. Knowing his expertise with the cards, Pat invites Nilesh to join him in the inner chambers to play with the high rollers. Upon some persuasion from Madhu, he gives in and gambles. Taking over Nilesh's turn, Pat loses all the money they have won to an underworld don. In the meantime, in his search for Madhu, Nilesh stumbles into the restroom where he finds Madhu apparently being forced upon by a local goon. He later learns that she was just plying her trade. A police encounter specialist, a religious but notorious south Indian don, a gay underworld don and the Mumbai red light underbelly too get involved. Starting the adventure with just Rs. 70 in his pocket, when he catches the first morning train home 2-½ hours later, he has Rs. 2.5 crores in his hands. How Nilesh lands up with this bounty and the girl by missing his train sums up this comic thriller.


The album of "Ek Chalis Ki Last Local" was composed by Call Band. The laree choote remake will be composed by Jack Known. It will be released in July 2020.


Martin D’Souza of "GlamSham" gave the movie 3.5 stars out of 5, concluding that "If you loved BHEJA FRY, you will love this flick. Don’t be late for a ride on this last local! As for the producers, the cash register has just begun jingling."Taran Adarsh of "Bollywood Hungama" gave the movie 3 stars out of 5, saying that "EK CHALIS KI LAST LOCAL is a decent fare that stands out for a few individualistic episodes in the narrative. At the box-office, the film caters to the multiplex audience mainly, especially big city multiplexes. Business in Mumbai multiplexes should be better due to its Mumbaiya flavor." Ashok Nayak of "NowRunning" gave the movie 2.5 stars out of 5, stating that "Ek Chalis Ki Last Local has shades of brilliance but 10 to 15 minutes can be easily trimmed off from the movie for better impact. Repeating and unnecessary stretching of scenes are repelling."

A sequel titled "Gyaraah Chalis Ki Last Metro" was announced in the early 2010s. It was announced that the film would feature Vivek Oberoi opposite Mallika Sherawat in lead roles. In early 2012, it was announced that the idea of an sequel had been slightly changed. The project would still be released with the same cast & crew, however it will not be noted as a sequel to "Ek Chalis Ki Last Local". In October 2012, the film released as "Kismet Love Paisa Dilli".

Bye Bye Miss Goodnight

Bye Bye Miss Goodnight is the 2005 feature film debut of writer-director Karan Kandhari. It was filmed in Bombay and garnered the Best Cinematography award at the Portobello Film Festival for its bold use of the city's natural light in its digital cinematography. It stars Rajpal Yadav and Neha Dubey (Monsoon Wedding).

On any other night Rajesh would have fallen asleep by now in the cafeteria to sounds of old folk tales on his battered walkman.

Today however is the day he’s leaving. He’s decided, he will drive his taxi into the Bombay night, wherever daylight breaks is where he’s going to stop and start anew. Sounds pretty straight forward. If only the eccentric masseur who has appointed himself position of new best friend to our hapless cabby can convince Rajesh that leaving Bombay at 6 AM won’t get him past the city limits, he may actually stand a chance.

The crackly old folk tales Rajesh listens to punctuate the narrative, guiding him like an unwritten map as he embarks on this haphazard road trip into the weird and wonderful. A trip that only gets stranger by the arrival of a stowaway hidden under a pile of fruit in the back seat...

You can’t get lost if you don’t know where you’re going...

Rajpal Yadav one of India’s most beloved comedians delivers a memorable Keatonesque performance as the disenchanted cabbie Rajesh alongside the rambunctious Neha Dubey (Monsoon Wedding) as the stowaway who becomes his unlikely companion in this award-winning deadpan comedy. An Indian road movie...

"There is evidence of better things to come from British Asian directors, however, as Karan Kandhari demonstrates with Bye Bye Miss Goodnight. Offering a uniquely avant-garde snapshot of modern urban India, this visually ambitious road movie belies its modest budget to chronicle the unlikely encounter between a daydreaming Mumbai cabby and a pregnant, hitchhiking free spirit." - David Parkinson, BBC Film

Kailash (Dilip Kumar) loses his eyesight after a car accident. His wife gives birth to twin boys, one of them blind.

The doctor's wife leaves the blind baby in a Hindu temple, where he is discovered by the temple priest who raises the boy, now called Bholenath (Dilip Kumar). Kailash feels guilty about what he did to the blind baby and confesses it to his wife several years later. She becomes so distraught that she dies. 

Kailash raises his other son Sanjay (Dilip Kumar), who turns into a spoiled rich boy. Although Sanjay is engaged to Sonia (Leena Chandavarkar), he continues to have an affair with Lucy (Helen), who has a rich dangerous boyfriend Grasco (Madan Puri). Sonia's greedy brother Kunwal (Prem Chopra) agrees to marry a country girl Tara (Saira Banu) but wants a Rs. 3,00,000 dowry. She doesn't want to marry him, because she is in love with Bholenath, even though he is poor and blind. 

Bholenath thinks that his status is beneath hers and that she deserves a rich suitor. He steals the money from the Hindu temple to give to Kunwal for her dowry. His pet snake tries to stop him from giving the money by biting him. He regains his sight and vows to the temple priest (Nazir Hussain) and Tara to bring the money back from Kunwal. Once he reaches the city, people mistake him for Sanjay, who in turn, is hiding out with Lucy after she leaves Grasco along with Rs. 15,00,000. She is found dead with the money missing.

The film was later remade in Telugu as "Bhale Dongalu".

Vijay (Shashi Kapoor) is an engineer, who is in love with a rich girl named Rekha (Mumtaz). Rekha's snobbish father disapproves because Vijay is not wealthy, and so he has arranged for her to be married to a son of an evil politician. The evil politician is played by Madan Puri. Rekha's father and the politician frame Vijay for a crime that he didn't commit, and he goes to jail. When he's in jail, he becomes friends with three other prisoners. All four men escape from jail. After Vijay reconnects with Rekha, they all go to a small village called Shantinagar and help save the village from the evil politician and the bandits that terrorize the town. The evil politician is arrested. Rekha's father feels remorse and accepts Vijay. Vijay and his three prisoner friends go back to jail. However, the film ends on an optimistic tone indicating that their good deeds will be rewarded (i.e. that their prison sentences will be shortened).


The song of this movie was composed by the blind music composer, late Ravindra Jain. The film features some evergreen songs like ""Ghunghroo Ki Tarah"", ""Agre Se Ghaghro Manga De"" and ""Le Jayenge Le Jayenge"". Lyrics were written by Inderjeet Singh Tulsi.

Karan Singh lives a wealthy lifestyle in a palace along with his widowed mother, an elder brother, Shamsher, his wife and daughter. His mother, Rani Maa, spending most of her time playing cards, left his upbringing to his nanny. As a result, Karan ended up believing her to be his real mother. Now grown up and turned into a womanizer and an alcoholic, he comes to the rescue of a former air hostess, Lata, who is being molested by her boss. Subsequently he hires her as his secretary and allows her family to move into one of his cottages. Progressively, Lata attempts to change his bad habits. She initially meets with opposition, but eventually succeeds and they fall in love. Karan even builds a palace and names it "Prem Nagar" ("city of love"). However, one day their romance is shattered when Lata is accused of interfering in palace affairs and stealing a valuable necklace. Consequently, a much humiliated Lata and her family move out.

Later on, Karan finds out the truth about Lata's innocence but it is already too late, and Lata will never return to him due to his initial distrust. Consequently, Karan's health worsens as he struggles with his addiction.



The Hindu newspaper in its review of the film in 2015 quoted "Khanna is a perfect choice for the role, the drunkard scion of a royal family, blessed with a heart of gold.Technically the film scores highly on all spheres.Editing by K.A. Marthand and J. Narasimha Rao is slick and keeps the story moving at a steady pace, with no room for slackness." The Hansindia site noted that Khanna had never shied away from portraying roles that were slightly off the regular path and ‘Prem Nagar’ featured him as a decadent prince, Karan, who happily idles away his life as playboy. During the premier of the film, after watching the film Raj Kapoor kissed Khanna’s hands and complimented him for the way he used them like swords in the climax. ‘Prem Nagar’ was considered special by Khanna himself, as it featured his favourite song, “Yeh laal rang” sung by his ‘voice’ Kishore Kumar.

Durgadas has a change of heart and goes around looking for his son and his family, but in vain. Years later Durgadas is much more older and not expected to live long. He recruits a Secretary, Gayetri, who looks after him. Then when his relatives insist that he adopt his distant nephew, Anokhey, he agrees, only to have Gayetri bring home a young man, Billoo, who operates a simple Dal Roti restaurant. Durgadas is jubilant when he verifies that Billoo is indeed his grandson and throws a grand party. After the party, Durgadas (Nazir Hussain) passes away, leaving everything in Billoo's hands.

Durgadas's relatives, Iqbal Nath, his daughter, Rekha; a cousin, Satwani, and her son, Anokhey; along with Advocate Ramesh Khanna, conspire with each other and concoct a plan — a plan so devious that will not only entrap Billoo and Gayetri in it — but also make them loathe the day they met Durgadas.

Boy Friend is a 1961 Hindi movie directed by Naresh Saigal. The film stars Shammi Kapoor, Madhubala and Dharmendra. The film's music is by Shankar Jaikishan.
This movie is remake of the movie "Kismet", that starred the golden era superstar Ashok Kumar along with Mumtaz Shanti, Shah Nawaz and Mehmood.

Eight-year-old Madan is separated from his wealthy parents, Thakur Harcharan Singh (Shivraj) and his wife Rajni. Their other son, Madan's younger brother, Sunil (Dharmendra) grows up to become a police inspector and is searching for his lost brother Madan.

Madan (Shammi Kapoor) — who now is known by the name Shyam — has managed to survive by becoming a petty thief and has ended up in jail. On his release, he boards a train to Mumbai, where he meets Shantilal, a man he had known earlier in jail. The man, who is old and ill, asks Shyam to find his two daughters, Sangita and Sushma, whom he had abandoned due to poverty and debt years before.

When Shyam arrives in Mumbai, he begins searching for the sisters. He soon finds a young woman named Sushma (Nishi Kohli). When she drives off, he follows her in a taxi to a theater owned by Harcharan Singh — who arrives with his wife.

Sushma's elder sister Sangita (Madhubala) is practicing dance for her stage debut in a play called "Boy Friend." The problem is that the play does not have a male lead.

While they are at the theater, Mrs. Singh's necklace is stolen by someone in the crowd. Inspector Sunil has just arrived with his men, and they start chasing the thief. Shyam sees the thief hide the necklace in a case in the sisters' car. That evening, Shyam sneaks into the sisters' house and retrieves the stolen necklace from the case. He also meets Sangita. When he relays their father's message to them, the sisters invite him to stay with them.

Shyam leaves early the next morning to return the stolen necklace to Sunil. But the Singhs' servant Sampat (Dhumal) steals the necklace from him and sells the necklace to a dealer.

Shyam, deciding to leave the life of crime and seek a job, sees the ad for a hero opposite Sangita in "Boy Friend" and goes to audition in front of Harcharan Singh. He is hired and the show opens in Shimla with great success. When he takes Sangita skiing, she breaks her leg - an operation is expensive, and she cannot appear on stage any longer. Harcharan sends his manager to demand that the sisters pay off their debt to him or lose their house. Shyam is furious at this, and quits his job as hero for the theater company. Without a job, the problem is finding the money that Sangita needs desperately, without resorting to his old thieving ways.

Sanjay (Rajendra Kumar) is in love with Priya (Saira Banu). They are painting rosy dreams of their life as husband and wife, until Priya learns that her father has been arrested. The duo decide that they will get married after Priya is able to bail out her father. Sanjay is happy, but destiny has other plans: Sanjay dies in a car crash. But after he is escorted by an angel (David) to heaven, he learns that his death was a mistake.

The angel makes arrangements to send Sanjay back to earth, but his body has already been cremated. Then, the angel takes him to the house of Tarun Kumar, Sanjay's lookalike, who should have been originally killed instead of Sanjay. Tarun has been murdered just seconds before by his own brother (Prem Chopra). Sanjay learns that Tarun is a criminal and his brother wants to usurp his money. Now, it is up to Sanjay and his guardian to turn the tides and make up the loss.

Sanjay is a poor man making his living as a tourist guide in Darjeeling. He meets Priya Khanna, who has come from Calcutta. The duo fall in love. Everything is hunky dory for them, until Priya receives the news of her father's arrest. The duo decide to put their dreams on the hold until Priya's father is exonerated. Priya leaves, while Sanjay returns, hopeful and joyous. However, he dies in a car accident and is escorted by an angel for the retribution of his sins.

It is revealed that Sanjay was never supposed to die. The angel learns that he mistakenly killed Sanjay instead of his look alike, Tarun Kumar. As punishment, the angel is tasked with sending Sanjay back to Earth. On Earth, Sanjay's body has already been cremated. Realizing that now Sanjay's soul has to be put in somebody else's body, the angel takes him to Tarun's home. Unknown to them, Tarun has been shot in the back by his own brother mere seconds ago. The angel retrieves the bullet and tells Sanjay to occupy Tarun's body.

Priya succeeds in bailing out her father and learns from him that he was framed by Tarun. Meanwhile, Sanjay learns that Tarun was a criminal and correctly deduces that he was killed for his money. Tarun's errant ways have dissociated him from his grandmother, his only living relative. Sanjay decides to right Tarun's wrongs. Tarun's brother is shocked to see him alive, but Sanjay feigns ignorance. Tarun's secretary Rita is working for his brother secretly. Here, Priya comes back to exact revenge on Tarun, but is obviously stunned to see him.

Sanjay is saddened by the turn of events. He succeeds in convincing his friend (Rajendra Nath) about his true identity. Later, he slowly starts shutting Tarun's illegitimate businesses and diverts the money to charity instead. This sudden change stuns and surprises Tarun's grandmother, while his brother is angered at losing money to this newfound philanthropy. Sanjay starts courting Priya again. Seeing that Tarun has reformed, everybody gives him their blessing to his marriage with Priya. However, Rita drops a bombshell that she is married to Tarun.

Sanjay is unable to prove or disprove anything, making matters worse for him again. However, Rita is acting as a mere pawn in the hands of Tarun's brother. He decides to confront Rita to know the truth, but Tarun's brother has already anticipated it. He kills Rita and Priya is framed for the murder. Sanjay succeeds in running away and confronting Tarun's brother. Tarun's brother finally confesses all his crimes in front of Sanjay, which is also heard by Sanjay's buddy. Just as Sanjay is going to be killed by Tarun's brother, the angel knocks him out.

In the end, Tarun's brother is arrested on the basis of his testimony. Realizing that Sanjay will now be able to live the life in form of Tarun, the very life that was unjustly taken from him, the angel unites him with Priya and returns to his heavenly abode.

The song "Kaun Hai Jo Sapnon Mein Aaya" was inspired from Elvis Presley's "Marguerita" from "Fun in Acapulco" album.

This is story of a tea estate labour leader in the north eastern region of India during the British Raj. Sagina Mahato fights for the rights of the labourers and has the courage to face the tyranny of the British bosses. He is helped by a young communist Amal who comes to the place to upraise the poor and downtrodden masses.

Darjeeling-based Roy family consists of Subodh, his wife, Nanda, and their daughter, Nalini. On the occasion of Nalini's engagement ceremony with Mohan, a number of celebrations take place, including fireworks, which result in Nanda's accident, she passes out, is treated for minor injuries, and is allowed to recuperate. The next morning she wakes up claiming that she is Radha; that Nalini is not her daughter; and that Subodh is her brother-in-law. She also states that she is to get married to Ram Kumar of Bombay. Fearing that his wife is losing her sanity, Subodh first summons their family doctor, Dr. Verma, and then a Psychiatrist, Dr. Rajesh Khanna. Rajesh conducts some tests on Nanda and concludes that her brain activity is normal. Then Nanda sees a dead woman's body in her closet, which subsequently disappears when the others arrive; she also tries to kill herself – in vain. On her insistence, Subodh and she travel to Bombay to unravel this mystery – to no avail, and they return home. Then Nanda recalls a dressmaker named Glory D'Silva, and Rajesh undertakes the journey to Byculla, Bombay, and brings Glory back – who positively identifies Nanda and states that Radha, Nanda's sister, and her parents were all killed in a fire 16 years ago. The question remains, if Radha is dead, then why is Nanda claiming that she is her, and why is she unable to recollect the last 16 years of her life as Subodh's wife, and Nalini's mother?


All music composed by Lata Mangeshkar with the assistances of musical duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal.

Mela (1948 film)

Mela () is a 1948 Indian Hindi-language romantic tragedy film. It was produced by and directed by S.U. Sunny for Wadia Movietone. It starred Dilip Kumar, Nargis, Jeevan, Rehman and Nur Jehan. The film's music was composed by Naushad. Mukesh gave playback for Dilip in this film and one of the "Mukesh hits" was "Gaye Ja Geet Milan Ke". Mohammed Rafi's voice was used just once, for the popular song "Ye Zindagi Ke Mele", set in a fairground and picturised on a wandering mendicant at the start of the film. Lyrics of the songs were written by Shakeel Badayuni with story and dialogue by Azam Bazidpuri.

The musical film, set in a village milieu, was a tragic love story involving Manju and Mohan. Manju is married off to a seventy-year-old man, who declares that he didn't realise he was being married to someone so young. After the husband's death, the lovers meet and Manju dies accidentally. Mohan is convicted for her murder, and after spending twenty years in jail, he too falls off the cliff and dies when he follows Manju's spirit.

Manju lives in the village with her father, a school teacher and step-mother. Mohan (Dilip Kumar) and Manju (Nargis) live in the same village and are friends since childhood. The friendship develops into love and they are both excited about their wedding. Mohan decides to go into town to buy jewelry for the marriage. On the way he is robbed and becomes unconscious, with his injuries landing him in hospital.

Mehkoo (Jeevan), is a no-good retired from the army man, who lusts after one of the young village girls. He is influential with Manju's stepmother and, with her by his side he calls the village panchayat. Here, he denounces Mohan as a cad who has run way with a girl, telling them that he won't return for the marriage. Since the wedding day has been fixed, the panchayat agrees with Mehkoo that Manju should get married on the day decided. A supposedly suitable groom is found for Manju, who turns out to be a seventy-year-old sickly man. When he enters the wedding chamber, he finds that Manju is too young to be his bride. Remorseful, he asks for forgiveness, but pleads with her to care of his children. Manju takes on the role of the old man's wife. The man dies, with Manju now left a young widow in charge of the children.
One night in stormy weather, she goes out to meet Mohan, and is killed when she falls off a cliff. Mehkoo and other villagers arrive to convict Mohan of murdering Manju. Mohan says nothing in his defense and is sentenced to twenty years imprisonment. On release from jail, Mohan goes to the same place where Manju had died. He sees her spirit, who beckons him to follow her. As he does, he falls off the cliff edge and dies.



The film came in for harsh criticism from the editor of "Filmindia", Baburao Patel. In the December 1948 issue of the cine-magazine, he compared the "formula" used for the story as similar to that of the film "Rattan" (1944), terming it as a "rehash of Rattan". His review focused on the Parsi (Wadia) and Muslim (Bazidpuri) angle, who he reported as wanting to run down the Hindus by making a regressive film like Mela. Calling the film a slander on Hindus, he labelled it as an anti-social film, which encouraged suicide, a criminal offense. The army was slandered because the film showed the villain as an ex-army man, "The most objectionable character in the picture is that of Mehkoo". He found "unbelievable" features in the story, especially the quick arrangement for Manju's wedding without looking for Mohan, and that a seventy-year-old widower remarrying, wouldn't know the age of the woman he's going to marry. 
The film was commended for its "pleasant photography", Nargis was praised, but was found to be unacceptable and seemingly "synthetic" in her role of a mother. Dilip Kumar as the hero "does his job well". For Jeevan, who played Mehkoo, he had this to say, "Jeevan plays Mehkoo and succeeds in creating disgust and revulsion, the two main aspects of his role".

The film was released on 8 October 1948 at Excelsior cinema, Bombay. The music of the film was a main part in the commercial success at the box-office, with it being reportedly referred to as Naushad's "Golden jubilee (fifty weeks) Mela". According to Meghnad Desai, a weak story was camouflaged by the "stunning melodies" in "Mela" and other films.

The reported box office gross for the film according to IBOS was ₹. 50 lakhs in 1948. The adjusted gross as of 2015 is roughly estimated at ₹. 340.44 crores.

Composer Naushad had Shamshad Begum singing some memorable songs, in the process getting the "best out of Shamshad" for this film. "Dharti Ko Aakash Pukaare" and "Taqdeer Bani Banke Bigdi" by Shamshad are both notable songs, reportedly showing her growth as a "serious singer". The song "Dharti Ko Aakash Pukaare" was originally put in as a title song, but it became extremely popular forcing the producers to have the full song added in the film.

Another popular song was the Bidai (Farewell) number, "Gaaye Jaa Geet Milan Ke" (Sing Songs Of Meeting) sung by Mukesh, at the time of Manju's departure from home after marriage. It was used in the film to show Manju's feelings, which highlight her "secret sorrows" that "cannot be voiced but are palpable" through the medium of the song. The song is sung by Mohan (Dilip Kumar) as he's racing home in his bullock cart to meet Manju (Nargis), whereas Manju is leaving for her husband's home.

Mohammed Rafi's popularity as a singer rose with the single song sung by him in "Mela", "Ye Zindgi Ke Mele".

"Chiranjeevulu" (1956), a Telugu language film, was a remake of "Mela". In the Telugu version, the hero is turned blind, and the old man who marries Manju is changed to a young bachelor, Dr. Krishna. The film was made under the Vinoda Productions banner, produced by D. L. Narayana (Dronamvajhala Lakshmi Narayana) and directed by Vedantam Raghavaiah. The dialogue writer and lyricist was Malladi Ramakrishna Sastry. The film starred N.T.Ramarao, Jamuna, Gummadi Venkateswara Rao, Peketi Sivaram, C.S.R. Anjaneyulu. For actress Jamuna, it was cited as her "career-best performance"; Peketi Sivaram played the negative role of Mehkoo, originally played by Jeevan. The film "was a box office grosser".

"Mela" had music directed by Naushad with lyrics by Shakeel Badayuni. The singers were Mukesh, Shamshad Begum, Zohrabai Ambalewali and Mohammed Rafi.

Aashirwad

Aashirwad is a 1968 Bollywood film, directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee. The film stars Ashok Kumar and Sanjeev Kumar. The film is notable for its inclusion of a rap-like song performed by Ashok Kumar, "Rail Gaadi".

The protagonist Jogi Thakur (Ashok Kumar) is a simple man of high principles. He is a resident son-in-law who, with his wife, has been bequeathed property and estates by his father-in-law. He breaks his marriage to an autocratic landlady (Veena) when he finds out that on his wife's order, the chief accountant of the estate has cunningly obtained his signatures on an order that the houses of the poor be burnt. He leaves home, vowing never to return as long as he lives, leaving his daughter Neena behind. He moves to Mumbai where he makes a living by entertaining children in a park (the famous song "Rail Gaadi", said to be India's first rap number). He is specially fond of a girl whose name, incidentally, is Neena (played by baby Sarika), too. Unfortunately, the girl takes ill and dies.

Jogi then returns to his village, Chandanpur, where he finds that the daughter of one of his villager friends, Baiju, has been abducted. He rushes someplace where she is about to be raped by the estate's cunning chief accountant, and he kills him to protect the girl. The villagers make up a phony story to save him, but he opts to tell the truth in the court and is jailed. There, he starts tending to the garden and composes philosophical poems. The doctor at the jail, Dr. Biren (Sanjeev Kumar) takes a special liking to him. Coincidentally, Neena, Jogi Thakur's daughter is set to be married with the doctor. Jogi Thakur finds this out by chance as he is tending to the garden outside doctor's room and overhears their conversations. He also learns that his daughter hates criminals. And so he shields his face from her on the few occasions that they meet. Unfortunately, he takes ill just as he is granted pardon by the government for his good behaviour. The doctor, has come to think of him as a father figure. He tells Jogi Thakur that the day he will be out of jail will be the eve of his marriage. Jogi Thakur is taken by the desire to see his daughter being wedded, and hurries to see her. However, he does not want anyone to recognize him. Finally he joins the beggars who have gathered for a treat for the marriage, where his daughter and son-in-law are serving food. He manages to give his blessings to her and hurries out. However, as he collapses on the road, he is recognized and people gather around him. The news reaches his daughter who rushes to the spot to meet with her father at his last moment.

Adorned with such wonderful songs such as "Rail Gaadi" sung by Ashok Kumar himself, "Ek Tha Bachpan" by Lata Mangeshkar (sung by Jogi Thakur's daughter) and finally the memorable "Jeevan Se Lambe Hai Bandhu Yeh Jeevan Ke Raste" by Manna Dey (sung by the bullock-cart driver who carries Jogi Thakur near his village in the night), the movie is an emotional journey through a man's life who stands by his principles only to be finally overcome by love for his daughter.


The music of the film was by Vasant Desai, with lyrics by Gulzar. Harindranath Chattopadhyay wrote the song "Rail Gaadi..."

Kaun?

Kaun? () is a 1999 Indian suspense thriller film directed by Ram Gopal Varma, written by Anurag Kashyap and starring Urmila Matondkar, Manoj Bajpayee and Sushant Singh. It was shot in 15 days. This movie has been dubbed into Telugu as "Evaru".

The story starts with a young woman (Urmila Matondkar) talking to her parents, about when they would come back home and her feeling scared . She then watches the news of a serial killer on television, when the doorbell rings. The woman sees through the peephole that it is a young man, who later identifies himself as Sameer A. Purnavale (Manoj Bajpai), claiming to be a business partner of Mr. Malhotra. She is reluctant to open the door, due to the news of a killer on the loose. The woman claims that the house doesn't belong to Mr. Malhotra, but to a Mr. Gupta. However, the man believing that there has been a mix up, persistently keeps ringing the doorbell even after the woman tells him that she won't let him in. To scare him away, the woman lies and tells the man that her husband is sleeping upstairs. The man then claims that he had seen a man walking upstairs so that if her husband is awake, he could talk to him. Upon hearing this and a subsequent noise from within the house, the woman is spooked and runs outside. Purnavale then takes the woman back inside, reassuring her that he is protecting her.

Then, he started to remember a story between his early girlfriend and him but, suddenly there is a powercut and Urmila went to the kitchen to take some candles, where she found her pet cat being slaughtered by someone (thinking it to be Manoj Bajpai). In a fraction of second she run outside in fear and opens the door, only to find another man with a gun, who later identifies himself as Inspector Qureshi (Sushant Singh). The two doubt his credentials, and Qureshi phones the police station and calls for help. The two men then get into a fight, and during the struggle the woman gets hold of Qureshi's gun, and asks them to sit quietly. It is then revealed that the man claiming to be Inspector Qureshi is in fact a thief. The woman telephones her mother and asks her to contact the police.

Sameer tries to kill Qureshi, thinking that he is the serial killer and then uses the telephone to call the police, however he finds that the phone is not working. He is unable to understand what is happening and asks the woman to hide somewhere safe inside the house while trying to figure out a solution to the problem. The doorbell rings and Purnavale answers. He starts looking around for the woman, calling out to her that there was a man asking for Mr. Malhotra and is confused because the woman claimed when they met that the house belongs to Mr. Gupta. Whilst searching for her in the attic, Sameer stumbles upon a dead body and identifies it as that of Mr. Malhotra. Sameer panics and when he looks around the woman attacks him and in self-defense he tries to kill her. In this confusion, the thief who is mortally wounded stabs Sameer to death to save the woman, assuming that Sameer was the killer. Whilst the thief checks on Sameer's body, the woman begins humming and stabs the thief to death.

At the end of the movie it is established that the woman is mentally ill and is in fact the serial killer on the loose, as she cleans up the bodies and rearranges the furniture and proceeds to talk to her mother using the disconnected telephone. Before the credits it is shown there is another man at the door asking for Mr. Malhotra, she then turns to the camera and smiles devilishly.


Anupama Chopra in her review for "India Today" stated, "Relentlessly experimental, he moved from the MTV love story "Rangeela" to the spoof-gone-poof "Daud" to the gritty underworld saga "Satya" without a pause. In "Kaun", Varma takes a shot at an "Ittefaq"-style songless suspense thriller and almost pulls it off." Suparn Verma of "Rediff" said, "The film starts with a big scare that leaves you feeling silly and, slowly, as the momentum picks up, it draws you in. You prepare for the worst, and end up jumping at shadows. Though the climax is a little long-drawn and leaves you with some unanswered questions, it delivers the required punch."

Kaun was successful at box office. According to the "Hindustan Times", "Kaun" enjoys a near cult status today. An English version of the film "Who's There" was released online in 2014.

Even after two decades of the release; Kaun is popular among movie fans who follow thriller-horror genre. The main element that makes this movie alive is the screenplay and characters of it, especially the one played by Urmila Matondkar.

Aakhri Khat

Aakhri Khat (English: The Last Letter) is a 1966 Bollywood film written and directed by Chetan Anand. This film marked the debut of Rajesh Khanna, who became the first superstar of Indian Cinema from 1969. The music of the film is by Khayyam and lyrics by Kaifi Azmi; it includes the song "Baharon Mera Jeevan Bhi Sanwaro", sung by Lata Mangeshkar. The film was given 5 stars in Bollywood Guide Collections.

Chetan Anand, started the film with a bare outline of a script and a 15-month-old infant who he let loose in the city, following him with his camera, mostly a hand-held camera, taking in all the city sounds, under the cinematic direction of Jal Mistry The film was selected as the Indian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 40th Academy Awards in 1967, but was not accepted as a nominee.

The film was remade in Tamil as Poonthalir starring Sivakumar and Sujatha (actress) in 1979 and in Telugu as Chinnari Chitti Babu in 1981.

Govind (Rajesh Khanna) is a young sculptor. While vacationing near Kullu, he sees Lajjo (Indrani Mukherjee) and falls in love. Subsequently, they get married secretly in a village temple. He then has to leave for the city to further his education. Meanwhile, the girl learns that she is pregnant. On finding this, her stepmother sells her off for Rs. 500, where she is beaten. Some time later, she gives birth to a little boy named Buntu. Later, Lajjo comes to Mumbai to meet Govind, carrying her one-year-old son. She leaves a letter for him at his doorsteps, and wants to leave the child with him as well. However, she is unable to go through with it, so she takes Buntu with her. They keep wandering and feed off whatever comes their way, but soon she dies leaving her son alone.

The rest of the film is a story of the little child, wandering around the city. He goes out of the house, eating whatever he finds, including a pill, which makes him doze off. On waking up, he wanders even more and more into the city. Meanwhile, Govind, comes to know all, through a letter she has left behind, "Aakhri Khat" (Last Letter).

Rajesh Khanna disclosed in an interview,"I consider “Aakhri Khat” a memorable film of my initial days. It was out and out a director's project and Chetan Anand, highly imaginative and sensitive director handled the film with expertise. I still clearly remember how cinematographer Jal Mistry shot the song sequence, “Ab Na Ja” on me and Indrani Mukherjee in five to six close ups also picturising the natural panorama of the Himalayas with rare aesthetics and perfection. My most challenging scene in “Aakhri Khat” was the last one where I am in a pensive mood in silence till I recognise my son, Bunty. Chetan Anand used to wake me up with late night phone calls so that my face had the ideal pathos oriented look."

The soundtrack includes the following tracks, composed by Khayyam, with lyrics by Kaifi Azmi. It also marked the debut of Bhupinder Singh as a solo playback singer.

Musafir (1957 film)

Musafir () is a 1957 Hindi film written by Ritwik Ghatak and Hrishikesh Mukherjee, and directed by the latter in his directorial debut. The film is about a house and the lives of three families who live in it, so in essence it is three stories linked by the house. The film stars Dilip Kumar, Kishore Kumar, Keshto Mukherjee, Suchitra Sen and Nirupa Roy. The music is by Salil Chowdhury.

For any young married couple, moving into their new house is a very special feeling. The feeling gets more special if the young couple has eloped and married. Something similar happened with Shakuntala (Suchitra Sen) and her husband. The landlord (David) helps the couple move to the rented house. The young couple moves to this house, which, incidentally is the main protagonist of the film. While Shakuntala makes the house into a beautiful home, her husband gets busy with work. She meets the neighboring tea vendor (Mohan Choti) and meets the next door "auntie", whose favourite pastime is to gossip about developments in others' homes. The couple hears the sound of a violin in the night and ask the tea-stall owner about it in the morning. He says that it is being played by a mad-man, Pagla Babu. Since the couple had eloped, Shakuntala wanted that her parents-in-law accept her as their daughter-in-law. This is what happens, and her in-laws somehow find the young couple and they are more than happy to meet Shakuntala. Finally, Shakuntala and her husband go with them and vacate the house. In between, Shakuntala plants some seeds in the garden.

The landlord again puts the TO LET sign on the house.

The next tenants in the house is a family headed by an old man Nazir Hussain. The other members are his elder widowed daughter-in-law (Nirupa Roy) and younger son Bhanu (Kishore Kumar). The daughter-in-law is pregnant and we are told that her husband had just died. Bhanu is finishing his college and simultaneously looking for a job, whereas his old father is somehow managing the expenses. Although there is sadness in the home, Bhanu, with his wit and humour, maintains a light atmosphere for his sister-in-law. The next door "aunty" again comes and chats on and on. Bhanu also hears the violin and when asks about it from the tea-vendor is told about Pagla Babu. The problems of the family increase as Bhanu fails to get a job landing the family in dire consequences. He gets frustrated and this leads to a clash with his father. On feeling humiliated, Bhanu finally drinks poison before sleeping. However, the poison is adulterated and Bhanu wakes up when the entire family is mourning. He gets the news that he has finally got a job in some other city. The pregnant lady also delivers a child. The family is happy and they move to another city vacating the house. We see that the seed which Shakuntala sowed has germinated.

The landlord again puts the TO LET sign on the house.

Note: This part of the movie is adorned with a lovely song by Kishore; "Munna Bada Pyaara, Ammi Ka Dulara".

The next inhabitants are a barrister and his widowed sister Uma (Usha Kiron). Uma has a small handicapped son (Daisy Irani). The neighbourhood "aunty" again visits the home. Like the previous tenants, this family also hears the sound of a violin in the night. The child is also attracted by the music and when he finds out about Pagla Babu from the tea-vendor, he insists on meeting him. However, the vendor tells the child that Pagla babu does not meet anyone. However, the child does not listen and insists on meeting the mysterious violinist. Pagla Babu does appear to meet the child. Uma is shocked to realize that Pagla Babu is none other than Raja (Dilip Kumar), her ex-lover. Raja, however, does not make it evident and interacts fondly with the child. In a very short span, an amazing bond is developed between Raja and the child. Initially, Uma is very uncomfortable with this bonding, but slowly she accepts it. We come to know that Raja is suffering from cancer and the dreaded disease is in its advanced stages. Ironically, Raja, who is on the verge of dying, pumps life into the child and fills his dark world with hope. He also tells the child that he will start walking once there is a flower in the garden. On knowing about Raja, Uma's brother is furious. There is a clash between them. Slowly, Raja reaches the final stage and Uma takes care of him. Eventually he dies and the child starts walking. Meanwhile, in the garden, the germinated seed finally blossoms into a flower.

Aaj Ka Arjun

Aaj Ka Arjun is a 1990 Hindi crime drama film, directed and produced by K.C. Bokadia and starring Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Prada. The film premiered on 10 August 1990 in Mumbai and was filmed in Rajasthan. The film became a box office hit. It is a remake of 1988 Tamil film "En Thangachi Padichava", starring Prabhu Ganesan and Rupini.

Thakur Bhupendra Singh (Amrish Puri) and his son Ajit (Rishabh Shukla) are landlords, presiding oppressively over a small Indian community. Ajit marries Laxmi and gets her pregnant (Raadhika) pregnant and casts her aside. Her brother Bheema (Amitabh Bachchan) goes to plead with them to accept Laxmi as their daughter-in-law and they reject his pleas and have him thrown out. Bheema tries to avenge this humiliation, only to have his sister killed. Bheema is imprisoned, and after his sentence is over he returns to his community, only to be told that he can no longer reside there, as the entire community is terrified of the Thakur and his men. Bheema then decides to move out of town. Some villagers and a police officer (Anupam Kher) persuade Bheema to return, and he agrees. On his return, Bheema's nephew Kanhaiya (Baby Guddu) is abducted by Thakur and his men, and he will only be returned after Bheema obtains signatures/thumb prints from everyone in the community, thereby turning over their properties to Thakur's name. Will Bheema compromise the safety of his nephew, and will he able to persuade the community to bow down to Thakur's demands?


The music for the film was composed by Bappi Lahiri, one of the leading music directors of the time. The film has a memorable number "Gori Hai Kalaiyaan, Tu Laade Mujhe Hari Hari Choodiyaan", with voices lent by Lata Mangeshkar and Shabbir Kumar, which earned great popularity that year. During those days, when cable television and Dish TV facilities were not as popular in India as they are today, this song was often telecast in some programmes of Doordarshan as a trendy track of that period. Picturised on Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Prada, the song charmed the listeners, and today it is considered as one of the evergreen songs of the 90s. Lyrics written by Anjaan.

Junoon (1978 film)

Junoon (Hindi: जुनून, translation: "The Obsession") is a 1978 Indian Hindi language film produced by Shashi Kapoor and directed by Shyam Benegal. The film is based on Ruskin Bond's fictional novella, "A Flight of Pigeons", set around the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The film's soundtrack was composed by Vanraj Bhatia, and cinematography by Govind Nihalani.

Its cast included Shashi Kapoor, his wife Jennifer Kendal, Nafisa Ali, Tom Alter, Shabana Azmi, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Naseeruddin Shah, Deepti Naval, Pearl Padamsee and Sushma Seth. The film also featured Shashi and Jennifer's children Karan Kapoor, Kunal Kapoor, and Sanjana Kapoor.

The story is set around the Indian Mutiny of 1857. Javed Khan (Shashi Kapoor) is a reckless feudal chieftain with a Muslim Pathan heritage, whose world revolves around breeding carrier pigeons. His younger brother-in-law, Sarfaraz Khan (Naseeruddin Shah) is politically awakened and actively plots the fight against the British. Freedom fighters attack the local British administrators while they are in Sunday Worship at Church, massacring them all. Miriam Labadoor (Jennifer Kendal) manages to escape with her daughter, Ruth (Nafisa Ali) and mother (Ismat Chugtai), who is a Muslim lady from the royal Nawab family of Rampur and was married to an Englishman. The three women seek refuge with the wealthy Hindu family of Lala Ramjimal (Kulbhushan Kharbanda). Lala is torn between his loyalty for India and his privileged position under the British, and also his silent love towards Miriam, who seems to also reciprocate it silently. However, matters are taken out of his hand by Javed Khan who barges into Lala's house and forcibly takes Ruth and her family to his own house. This leads to jealousy on part of his wife, Firdaus (Shabana Azmi) and anger on part of his brother, who ultimately gives in to the Pathan tradition of offering hospitality and sanctuary (Nanawatai) even to uninvited guests. Various situations ensue due to cultural misunderstandings in the domestic routine of the Muslim household with its new English guests. Javed falls in love with Ruth, and wants to marry her but is opposed bitterly by her mother. Noticing intense feelings of Javed for her daughter Ruth, Miriam Labadoor (mother) cleverly makes an agreement with Javed that she would only give her daughter's hand to Javed if British were defeated. At first instance, Javed is hesitant but accepts the offer when again Miriam asks him if he has misgivings in his war against the British. There are simmerings of a love affair under the watchful suspicious eyes of Firdaus.

Meanwhile, the Rebellion runs into problems and the British are defeating the poorly organized Indian forces. In a stormy scene, Sarfaraz destroys Javed's pigeon coops and sets his pets free after he finds out that Indian forces have lost the Battle for Delhi. There is a delayed recognition by Javed of his subjugated identity, colonised by the British. Sarfaraz dies in a battle against the British. The Labadoors return to the protection of the re-deployed British contingent, smuggled by Firdaus, who only wants to save her marriage. Javed finds out that the Labadoors have sought sanctuary in the church and rushes there to meet Ruth one last time. Surprisingly, Ruth comes out and expresses her feelings for Javed against her mother's will. However, Javed honourably keeps his word and the promise he had made with Miriam Labadoor and leaves the church without Ruth. The movie ends here with the voiceover that Javed was martyred fighting the British while Ruth and her mother return to England. Ruth dies fifty five years later, unwed.


In a retrospective review, Raja Sen of Rediff.com called it "an overwhelmingly powerful film, a bittersweet, entirely futile love story."





The soundtrack features 4 songs, composed by Vanraj Bhatia, with original lyrics from Yogesh Praveen and other lyrics by Amir Khusro, Jigar Moradabadi and Sant Kabir.

Laila Majnu (1976 film)

Laila Majnu is a 1976 Hindi movie based on the legendary story of Layla and Majnun. This film version is directed by Harnam Singh Rawail and stars Rishi Kapoor, Ranjeeta, Danny Denzongpa, Aruna Irani, Asrani, Iftekhar, Tom Alter and Ranjeet. The film's music is by Madan Mohan and Jaidev.

Layla and Majnun, and Layla and Majnun also known as The Madman and Layla - () in ("Majnūn wa Laylā") or ("Qays wa Laylā"), in (Leyli and Madjnun), (Leyli və Məcnun) in Azeri - is a classical Arabic story of star-crossed lovers. It is based on the real story of a young man called Qays ibn al-Mulawwah () from the northern Arabian Peninsula. In one version, he spent his youth together with Layla, tending their flocks. In the other version, upon seeing Layla he fell passionately in love with her. In both versions, however, he went mad when her father prevented him from marrying her; for that reason he came to be called Majnun Layla, which means "Layla's Lunatic." It is a love story that originated as poem in 11th Century Arabia, later was adopted by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi who also wrote ""Khosrow and Shirin"". It is the third of his five long narrative poems, "Khamsa" (the Quintet).

H. S. Rawail's cinematic version of this moving tale of the original star-crossed lovers, Laila Majnu, starring Rishi Kapoor and Ranjeeta, does full justice to this enduring tale. It has the intense pangs of love, the painful obstacles that lie in its path and a soul-stirring performance by its lead actors as they bring Laila and Majnu alive. The musical score was composed by maestro Madan Mohan, who died before completing the film, and hence the baton was carried forward by Jaidev, seamlessly.

To recount the story, Laila and her lover Majnu, better known as Qais, were born to rival clans, the Amaris and the Sharwaris. The two loved each other as children. Their love was such that if one was hurt, the other started bleeding. The film recounts, how as kids at the madarsa, the maulvi asks them to write the name of Allah on their slates. Qais, who is lost in thoughts of Laila, inscribes her name instead. In return, an incensed maulvi canes him on the hand. But it is Laila's hand which starts bleeding. Incidents such as this, spread like wild fire and Laila's father, scared for his daughter's reputation, decides to stop her from going to school. The two clan heads decide to separate their children as it is impossible for them to conceive of the Sharwaris and the Amaris ever being joined by love instead of blood. Laila and her Majnu grow up in different places.

Many years later, Qais and his friends visit Laila's town to buy camels and the stage is set for the two lovers to meet again. One day at the marketplace, they encounter each other and it is love at first sight for both of them. They start meeting each other secretly, all over again. But the villain makes his entry in the form of Laila's hot-tempered brother Tabrez (Ranjeet). He has already had a spat with Qais, with neither knowing the other's true identity. In the turn of events that follow, Qais's father dies at the hands of Tabrez. Qais in turn, avenges his father's murder by killing Tabrez. He is exiled from the town and wanders about in the dunes, like a madman, thirsting for just a look of his beloved. Meanwhile, Laila is married off to a prince, Bakhsh (Danny). Learning of her love for Qais, he promises to keep his distance until such time that he is not able to replace Majnu in Laila's heart. Like all others before him, he is unable to understand the almost divinely ordained love of Laila and Majnu. When he does, it is too late.

The film was co-written by Abrar Alvi, a longtime associate of Guru Dutt.

Film's music is by Madan Mohan and Jaidev with lyrics by Sahir Ludhianvi.

The songs of the movie were hits. Especially "Is Reshmi Paazzeb Ki Jhankar", "Tere Dar Par Aaya Hoon", " Barbad-E-Mohabbat ki Dua" and "Husn Hazir Hai". "Husn Hazir Hai" also reached number one on the Binaca Geetmala annual list 1977, a rarity for a Madan Mohan composed song.

Pati Patni Aur Woh (1978 film)

Pati Patni Aur Woh () is a 1978 Hindi movie produced and directed by B. R. Chopra. The film stars Sanjeev Kumar, Vidya Sinha, Ranjeeta Kaur, and in guest appearances Rishi Kapoor, Neetu Singh and Parveen Babi. 

The film was remade under the same name in 2019 starring Kartik Aaryan, Bhumi Pednekar and Ananya Pandey. The film was directed by Mudassar Aziz and produced by Bhushan Kumar.

The film starts off indicating the parallels of the story with that of Adam & Eve. Here, Adam is Ranjeet, Eve is Sharda while the apple is Nirmala. Ranjeet is newly employed in a company, whose pay scales can be gauged from the fact that he goes to work on a bicycle. However, this bicycle itself brings him face-to-face with Sharda, when he bumps into her by accident. Sharda's bicycle gets badly damaged & Ranjeet drops her off. The same evening, Ranjeet goes to the wedding of his friend Abdul Karim Durrani (Asrani), a co-worker & a poet. Sharda is also present at the ceremony. Sharda & Ranjeet's love blossoms from there & soon they get married.

In the course of a few years, Ranjeet is Sales Manager of the company and father of a son. Sharda & Ranjeet are still living in marital bliss. That is, until Nirmala, Ranjeet's new secretary, shows up. Ranjeet is inexplicably attracted to Nirmala. She is an honest girl who is trying to make two ends meet. She is much more beautiful compared to Sharda. But most of all, she knows nothing about Ranjeet's true intentions & his married life. Ranjeet is initially upset with his thoughts about her, but finally gives in.

He carefully plans his further steps. He pretends to be the helpless grieving husband of a cancer stricken wife, who won't live much longer. Nirmala feels sorry for him, thus making it easier for him to get close to her. Nobody, not Sharda, not even his closest friend, suspects a thing. One day, Ranjeet bluffs to Sharda that he will be late coming home as he has a meeting. He takes Nirmala out to dinner. Next day, Sharda finds Nirmala's handkerchief, with lipstick marks on it, in Ranjeet's pocket.

She immediately confronts Ranjeet, who makes up a story about a co-worker whose handkerchief he may have accidentally taken. Sharda reluctantly believes him. Ranjeet decides to take his next steps more carefully. Sharda too starts thinking that her fears were unfounded. Ranjeet makes even more interesting back up plans: He prepares two books of poetry, professing his love. The poems are the same in both, only one book contains Nirmala's name, and the other contains Sharda's.

Ranjeet courts Nirmala without Sharda's knowledge. The turning point comes when Sharda sees him in a hotel with Nirmala. She later asks him about his meeting, about which the clueless Ranjeet lies. Sharda's fears are confirmed. She starts spying on him & Nirmala, taking incriminating pictures. After sufficient evidence is obtained, she secretly meets Nirmala, posing as a journalist. Nirmala, who hasn't seen Ranjeet's "ailing wife" yet, thinks Sharda intends to blackmail her. But Sharda reassures her that she won't.

Nirmala spills all the beans, upon which Sharda reveals her true identity. Meanwhile, Ranjeet gets another promotion & rushes home happily to tell his wife about it. Sharda catches him unawares and lets him know that he is busted. Ranjeet does not know what has hit him. He turns round, only to see Nirmala behind him. Sharda tells him that she is leaving him & the divorce papers will be soon sent to him. Sharda & Nirmala console each other. Ranjeet calls upon his friend & lies that Nirmala has said some malicious lies to Sharda about him.

Ranjeet's friend sides with him & lies about Nirmala's character. Sharda exposes Ranjeet in front of him as well, with help of the evidence she has collected. Sharda tells Ranjeet to choose either her or Nirmala. Ranjeet quietly gives Nirmala some money & lies to her, in a last-ditch attempt at damage control. But honest Nirmala returns the money to Sharda, making things even worse for Ranjeet. Sharda prepares to walk out on Ranjeet, while Nirmala resigns and leaves Ranjeet as well. Sharda comes to visit Ranjeet one last time, when their innocent son asks what is happening.

Sharda decides to give Ranjeet another chance, if only for their son and soon life comes back on track. But soon another secretary (Parveen Babi) joins the office & Ranjeet tries to resort to his antics once more. Just by coincidence, Ranjeet's friend suddenly walks in & Ranjeet backs off, taking this as a warning.

Amanush

Amanush (English: "Inhuman") is a 1975 Indian action drama film made in both Hindi and Bengali, produced and directed by Shakti Samanta. The film stars Sharmila Tagore, Uttam Kumar, Utpal Dutt and Asit Sen. Both the versions were hits.

The Bengali version of the film achieved immense popularity amongst Bengalis and featured many memorable songs by Kishore Kumar like "Bipinbabur Karansudha" and "Ki Asha-y Baandhi Khelaghar". Also, this film featured the Bengali film star Uttam Kumar at the height of his popularity and Utpal Dutt turned in a typically stellar performance as the villain.

The film was later remade in Telugu as "Edureeta" (1977), starring N.T. Rama Rao, in Malayalam as "Ithaa Oru Manushyan" and in Tamil as "Thyagam", with Sivaji Ganesan. After "Amanush", Samanta once again made another double version, "Anand Ashram" (1977), with the same lead actors, however, that film didn't do well at the box office.

"Amanush" (made simultaneously in Bengali and Hindi) to marvel at the scope of the man’s histrionic capabilities. Kumar shines as Madhusudan Roy Chaudhary, or Madhu, a straightforward scion of a zamindar family settled in a fishing village in the Sunderbans. He reflects angst and anger with understated ease after his life is ripped asunder by the machinations of the family munim, Maheem Ghosal (a superlative performance by veteran Utpal Dutt). Reduced to a penniless drunkard, he is condemned to live the life of an amanush — half human, and half beast. As a debauched vagabond, he raises his voice on behalf of the downtrodden who suffer under the highhanded and corrupt Ghosal. This brings him face to face with the law enforcers, who are often hand in glove with the wily Ghosal.

It is in this backdrop that Inspector Bhuvan (Anil Chatterjee) lands in the village, where Ghosal ‘fills his ears’ against Madhu. Bhuvan, without going into merits of the case, acts harshly on Madhu, even whipping him at the police station. However, soon he comes to know the story of Madhu and his estranged love interest, Rekha (Sharmila Tagore).

In a flashback, Madhu tells him how he was entrapped in a fake case of theft in his own house, whereon his ailing paternal uncle, under the influence of the munim, handed him over to the police. He is also accused of fathering a child through a prostitute. Before he can prove his innocence the woman is abducted and killed at the behest of Ghosal. On completing his prison sentence, Madhu returns to his village, only to find that his uncle has been murdered by the munim, who shows it as a case of natural death.

Thereon, Bhuvan embarks on a mission to reform Madhu and gets him a contract for building a dam in an adjoining village. A determined Madhu, with his two sidekicks, completes the job commendably. He even wins back the confidence of Rekha, whom he saves from drunken streamer operators one night. But the ice is finally broken when the village is endangered by raging flood waters that threaten to breach the dam. All villagers persuade Madhu to take the mantle of saving the village, but he spurns them, blaming them for his misery. Finally, on a visit by Rekha he relents, and saves the dam and the village from havoc.

His honour is restored, as is his love interest. Ghosal is arrested for his wrongdoings by Bhuvan, even as he is transferred to a new posting.

She deposits it to Rohit, which he safely locks in his safe.

Since Rohit feels it's not safe for her to wait at the platform he offers to drop her at his quarters, near by and she readily agrees to it.

Moti Babu, scared that the truth will come out, plots against Rohit. Since Rashmi is so fond of him, the best way to get Rohit out of his way would be to somehow make her dislike him.

And with the help of Bahadur and Bijli he manages to prove that Rohit tried to rape Bijli and has cheated on Rashmi. As per Panchayat's decision, a punishment, he's thrashed in front of the villagers and asked to leave the place immediately.

Moti Babu is celebrating his victory with Bahadur and Bijli. Rashmi happens to witness this and is disgusted. Much against wishes of Diwan and Moti Babu, she leaves the house and runs away with Rohit singing "Hum dono do premee". They go to Bombay and get married in a temple.

Two men show up at his office and they wake him up from his reverie. They introduce themselves as Inspector Tiwari and Inspector Sinha and enquire about a girl with an attache – Sonia. They tell him that she has stolen some valuables and has run away, and they are investigating the case. Though suspicious, Rohit doesn’t reveal her whereabouts. He goes to his quarters and confronts her. But she tells him she hasn’t stolen anything and gives him her mother's letter. After reading it he's convinced that she's innocent.

He comes back to his office. It's raining very heavily outside. Standing by the window he stares out and gets into a flashback mode again. This time the newly wed Rashmi and Rohit are singing "Bheegi bheegi raaton mein" in the rain.

Brought up the way she was, Rashmi doesn’t know much of household work. She has a tough time trying to learn how to cook. They get acquainted with Chetan Kumar (Asrani), who lives in the floor below and become friends with him. He also helps her develop her culinary skills.

Rohit works for Bombay Publicity, an Ad Agency and Rashmi, on the other hand gets bored sitting at home the whole day with nothing to do. Since she has a good knowledge of colours she starts painting (inspired by Chetan) and wants to gift the painting to Rohit on his birthday. One fine day Chetan suggests her to start modelling. Having seen how his boss, M.M. Puri (Madan Puri) deals with models, Rohit is not happy about how the modelling world works.

But Rashmi, with a wealthy background is not used to live the way she is living and doesn’t like compromising for every little thing. And she remains adamant about her decision until Rohit gives in. Indifferences start creeping in but Rohit is understanding and does all he can to keep Rashmi happy, though his ego keeps coming in between (sounds contradicting?). In no time she becomes a top model and even goes on to win a beauty pageant. She becomes thrilled with the idea that now within a short span of time, name and fame would knock her doors.

Soon after this, she realises she's expecting. She wants to pursue her career and thinks it's not the right time to start a family and even thinks of going for an abortion. But Rohit wants the child. So she decides to keep it. One day Rohit calls and when she goes down to Chetan's flat to answer the call, she slips and falls down the staircase. This results in a miscarriage. But Rohit feels she got an abortion done and gets mad at her. They have a row and he walks out of the house. Having realised that he over-reacted, he comes back home in the evening and apologises but only after a while he finds out that Rashmi has left the house and gone.

He later on learns from Chetan that she had fallen down and had a miscarriage. He calls her but she doesn't speak to him. He resigns from Bombay Publicity and he sets out to bring her back. He goes to Diwan's house but learns that they have left the place and gone on a vacation. No one knows when they’ll come back. Devastated, he goes to his uncle's house. There's a letter for him there, a legal notice asking for a divorce. Not knowing what to do next, he seeks employment and with the help of Mr. Saxena (Mama's friend), he gets the post of a Station Master at a remote hill station, Deena Pur.

Back to present...he’s at work and Mr. Saxena comes to meet him. He's surprised to see Mr. Saxena at such a remote place. To this, Mr. Saxena says he had come hunting with Diwan Sardarilal, who has put up at a place named Karimganj, nearby. He leaves for Karimganj to meet Rashmi. Rashmi seeing him doesn't seem to be happy. Rohit on the other hand tries wooing her back and further requests her to join his new residence that he got as a railway employee. Meanwhile, Rashmi's father enters the scene and instructs Rashmi to get away from there. He and Moti babu tries every possible way to humiliate Rohit due to his low socio-economic condition. Rohit further remaining confident vows before Moti Babu to bring in money in order to get Rashmi back.

Renukadevi is widowed and the mother of a son named Ram. Her husband had indulged in all possible vices, and died. Her father-in-law, Rai, does not want Ram to repeat his father's mistakes, and teaches him all the positive values of the Hindu religion, in particular the contents of the Bhagavad Gita. As a result, Ram refrains from all known vices, is an expert in yogic exercises, decides to live the life of a celibate, and refuses to marry anyone. When Rai dies, Renuka asks Ram to fulfill his grandfather's last wishes, one of which was to get married. She even arranges his introduction to Aarti, an attractive young woman. But Ram is convinced that marriage is not for him. Renuka is overjoyed when her estranged brother, Gopinath, and his son, Rakesh, return from abroad. With their help she hopes to get Ram marries with Aarti. Then things get complicated when Rakesh falls in love with Aarti. Ram leaves town to attend to business, and circumstances propel Renuka to will her entire estate to Rakesh and change his name to Bharat, with the blessings of a renowned saint named Ishwar Baba. After this ceremony, the people around Renuka start showing their true colors, and after an open-palmed stinging slap from Aarti, Renuka realizes that her place in this house is now worse than that of a lowly servant. Renuka now finds out that Aarti, Gopinath, and Rakesh are not who they claim to be, but will this realization be enough to reverse the order of events, or does fate have something even worse in store for Renuka?

Ram (Manoj Kumar): In a gorgeous place stays a sanyasi – a religious minded young man who runs away from the wedding nuptials.

Aarti (Hema Malini): Today's Menaka. Yesterday's Menaka tried to disturb Vishwamitra's communion with god and today's Menaka Aarti tries to distract Ram's mind away from his religious thoughts. She adopts many disguises and agrees to do what one least expects a noble, attractive, and good girl like her to attempt.

Renuka Devi (Sulochana): Ram's mother. Her husband ruined his life while he was still young, because of drinking and womanising. Not wanting her son to be like his father, she has kept Ram surrounded by a religious atmosphere since his childhood. The result is that Ram grows up to be different from all other young men – a true sanyasi.

Girdhari and Banwari: The robbers. They have entered Ram's house in disguise as his uncle and cousin, posing as father and son. They have taken the place of Renuka Devi's brother and his son who died in a train accident. Ram's mother embraces them as her long separated brother and nephew, but does not know that these two devils are here to swindle her belongings and happiness.

Shanti Baba: A true sanyasi. Who can kill the soul that lives only to bring happiness to others? The most unforgettable screen character you will ever come across, the true sanyasi who lays down his life in order to rescue a helpless woman from the clutches of Mangal Singh.

Ishwar Baba: A fraud, a blot on the very noble tribe of a saffron-clad sanyasi. He is, in fact, evil dacoit Mangal Singh, a murderer, rapist and drunkard. But in daytime he poses as a recluse and pretends to perform miracles to impress the unsuspecting devotees.


Music Director for all songs: Shankar-Jaikishan

Kal Aaj Aur Kal

Kal Aaj Aur Kal () is a 1971 Hindi film produced by Raj Kapoor and directed by his son Randhir Kapoor.

Among the non Kapoors in the film are Iftekhar.

It was also the last Shankar Jaikishan score in a Raj Kapoor film; it contains superhit songs like "Aap Yahan Aaye Kis Liye" and "Bhanware Ki Gunjan". This film came after the heavy debacle of "Mera Naam Joker", which was Raj Kapoor's dream project. It more than made up for his loss although it was still only a moderate success at the box office. The film marked one of Prithviraj Kapoor's final films as he died the following year of the film's release in 1972.

The title is an allegory to the ideological clash between three generations: Kal (Grandparent), Aaj (Parent) and Kal(Youth). Diwan Bahadur Kapoor (Prithviraj Kapoor) is the father of Ram Bahadur Kapoor (Raj Kapoor). Ram's son Rajesh (Randhir Kapoor), who had been sent to London for higher studies, returns to India.

However, Rajesh is in love with his girlfriend Monica (Babita) and objects to the marriage. Both the grandfather and the grandson stick to their guns, little realizing that Ram is the real sufferer in the clash. Ram leaves his home, leaving the grandfather grandson duo blaming each other. Now, it is up to Ram to take the matter into his hands.

Anoop's mom is quite exasperated with Minoo and is compelled to keep the new bride under lock and key. When the time comes for Anoop to return to Calcutta, he asks Minoo to come with him, but she refuses.

His mother cannot handle Minoo's childishness and refuses to let her stay with her. Anoop accordingly leaves Minoo with her mom, Sharda. Once Anoop leaves her and heads back to Calcutta, Minoo starts realising she misses him. All her earlier activities of fooling around and playing with the village kids loses their charm and, in her loneliness, she realises her love for Anoop. She then tells her mom that she wants to go back to Anoop's house, reconcile with her mother-in-law and live with her. Minoo goes back, a changed person. Anoop's mom welcomes her daughter-in-law. Minoo excels in her household duties. But Anoop does not visit even for his holidays. Minoo realises that, when she had refused to accompany him to Calcutta, Anoop's ego was bruised. He had promised that he would come only when she wrote to him to come back. So she writes a letter to Anoop telling him to come home. But she does not have his address, so Anoop never gets the letter. In the meantime, Anoop's mom, realizing that Minoo is truly missing her husband, suggests a trip to Calcutta to visit him. It is in Anoop's sister's house in Calcutta that the love-lorn couple finally comes together.

Mehbooba (1976 film)

Mehbooba is a 1976 Hindi film produced by Mushir-Riaz and directed by Shakti Samanta. The film stars Rajesh Khanna, Hema Malini and Prem Chopra. The story is based on the reincarnation theme. The music is composed by Rahul Dev Burman. The film is noted for an impressive performance by the lead pair and for its haunting melodies such as the solo song "Mere Naina Sawan Bhadon", sung by both Lata Mangeshkar and Kishore Kumar, "Chalo Ri" by Lata and the duet song "Parbat Ke Peeche". The plot is based on Gulshan Nanda's novel "Sisakate Saaz", and Nanda also wrote the screenplay himself. Upon its release, the film was big flop. This film has gained a cult following over the years and appreciation from audiences in its screening on television.

Singer Suraj (Rajesh Khanna) was presented with a veena (stringed musical instrument) by his fiancée. Thereafter, he often listens to a haunting song at nights and observes that its name was "Ratna". One day, while going for a stage show, he gets stuck in heavy rain in an unknown place and goes to stay in a small motel, where he meets a woman named Ratna. During the night, he observes that Ratna, singing the same song he often hears at night, is going to a distant mahal (grand house of olden times). He follows her reflexively and enters the abandoned mahal. He tries to call out for Ratna, but learns from old keeper of the mahal that Ratna died more than a hundred years ago and people feel that she still haunts that mahal.

Later, a portrait of Ratna makes him remember their previous life. In the previous life he was Prakash, chief singer of royal court. He was in love with Ratna, a beautiful and talented court dancer. They fell in love, but both had problems to marry as Prakash was already promised to Jamuna in his childhood and Ratna couldn't marry as she was to become a royal courtesan, At last, they decided to run away, but were killed on their way, promising each other that they would meet again.

Suraj, after coming to his senses, feels lonely and confused. Shortly thereafter, he meets a gypsy, Jhumri (also Malini), who looks exactly like Ratna. Soon he makes Jhumri remember her past life and her love for Prakash. This angers Rita Malhotra (Asha Sachdev), fiancée of Suraj and Appa (Prem Chopra), who wants to marry Jhumri. Appa steals the portrait, and sets the gypsies against Suraj, ensuring a fight between Suraj and gypsies. But Suraj and Jhumri manage to overcome all the obstacles and stay together in this life.

Initially, R.D. Burman had made a draft song version of the song "Mere Naina Sawan Bhadho" and sent the recording tape to Kishore. R.D. Burman had informed him that there is female version of the song too to be picturised. Kishore thought he would not be able to do justice to the song. He asked R.D. Burman to give him the tape with Lata's version on it. R. D. Burman agreed. He listened to the song for 7 days before recording. Kishore Kumar had his version recorded only after this. Till date, his version is more famous than Lata Mangeshkar's. Lata Mangeshkar's version has a long alaap, which comes thrice in the song, in the beginning, after the first antara and in the end. Kishore's version has humming instead of this. There are some more alaaps and one more version of the song by Lata Mangeshkar, which comes in the movie. This song is based on "Raga Shivranjani". This song played an important role in the sequence continuity of the film.

Another song, "Gori Tori Painjaniya" is the most complicated one in the album. By this time, Kishore Kumar had established himself as the voice of Rajesh Khanna. However, Khanna decided that the previous birth in the film would have Manna Dey and the current birth would have Kishore.


The music of this movie was composed by R. D. Burman. The songs "Mere Naina Sawan Bhadon", "Mehbooba" (title track) and "Parbat Ke Peechhe" too, were popular numbers.

It was a critical acclaimed and super hit movie. And was a breakthrough for both Sridevi and Rajinikanth.

Balaji (Kamal Haasan) and Prasath (Rajinikanth) are roommates in a city. Balaji falls in love with Selvi (Sridevi) who lives in the same apartment complex. Prasath, who has his eyes on Selvi, pretends to back Balaji's love while secretly hoping to create a divide between them. Selvi realizes Prasath's evil intentions when she finds out that he has seduced an innocent girl living in the same apartment complex. However, she is unable to convince Balaji, who hero-worships Prasath.

Things come to a head when Balaji and Selvi go for a picnic by the lake and Balaji decides to invite Prasath along. As the three of them head to the middle of the lake on a boat, Balaji topples over by mistake. Prasath refuses to jump in and save Balaji, on the pretext that he does not know swimming.

Vasu is the photographer who earlier blackmailed Chandru's father as he has pictures of him "in flagrante delicto". Revathi and Vasu visit Ravi and Geetha for a meal. Vasu takes photographs of the family. While developing the pictures, Vasu recalls Geetha's features; he had earlier clicked Geetha and Chandru during their amorous tryst and had been blackmailing Chandru before the latter got arrested.

Chandru is released from prison, and to Geetha's horror, Ravi hires him to be their driver. Vasu begins blackmailing Geetha and his financial demands increase. He also has altercations with Chandru. Geetha cannot cope with the mental and financial strain; she has a breakdown and is hospitalised. Chandru raids Vasu's darkroom, hoping to retrieve the damning negatives. In the ensuing fracas, Revathi bursts in and threatens to immolate herself and her child. Faced with the threat of losing his family before his very eyes, Vasu destroys the incriminating negatives and redeems himself. At the hospital, Ravi tells Geetha that he had full knowledge of the Chandru affair all along.


"Baalu Jenu" is a remake of the 1976 Tamil film "Mayangukiral Oru Maadhu". It was directed by Balan and Kunigal Nagabhushan, and produced by K. R. Ravichandran under S G S Films. Co-director Nagabhushan also wrote the screenplay. Cinematography was handled by T. M. Sundara Babu, and editing by P. K. Krishnan. Rajinikanth, after watching Thengai Srinivasan's performance in the original film as a blackmailing photographer, expressed his desire to reprise that role and duly got it. "Baalu Jenu" was also the first film where a character played by Rajinikanth had a major onscreen fight sequence.

Film critic Naman Ramachandran noted numerous parallels between Rajinikanth's character Vasu in "Baalu Jenu" and his character Prasad in "Moondru Mudichu" (1976). He also compared it to many other earlier Rajinikanth films such as "Apoorva Raagangal" (1975), "Munithaayi" (a segment of the 1976 anthology film "Katha Sangama"), "Anthuleni Katha" (1976) and "Moondru Mudichu" due to the fact that they focused on a central female character.

The soundtrack was composed by G. K. Venkatesh, with lyrics by Kunigal Nagabhushanam and R. N. Jayagopal.
"Baalu Jenu" was released on 10 December 1976. The film became a commercial success, and Rajinikanth went on to play more negative roles in films.

Avargal

Avargal () is a 1977 Tamil-language Indian romance film made by K. Balachander starring Sujatha, Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth. The film had a reputation of being one of the most sensitive films on women's lib. A triangular love story, it revolves around a woman who is caught between the man she fell in love with and her former sadistic husband who is supposedly reformed and wants to rejoin her.

Balachander later remade the film in Telugu as "Idi Katha Kaadu" (1979). The film qualified for the Indian Panorama, but was a failure. It won Sujatha the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Tamil.

Anu is a dancer in love with Bharani, a flautist. After her father is transferred to Bombay, she slowly loses touch with Bharani, who does not respond to any of her letters. When her father falls ill, his colleague Ramanathan supports them. When Ramanathan offers to marry Anu, she is in a fix. She seeks time to decide and writes one last letter to Bharani; due to no reply, she marries Ramanathan. Soon after, her father dies.

After marriage, Ramanathan reveals his true personality; chauvinistic, sadistic and possessive. Not wanting to be identified as a dancer's husband, he forces her to give up dancing. Ramanathan suspects Anu's character and expresses doubts regarding the paternity of their newborn son. Unable to take further abuse, and also for the well-being of her son, she divorces Ramanathan, refuses alimony, and returns to Madras to start a new independent life.

In Madras, Anu gets supportive friends at her office, particularly a widower Janardhan "Johnny" who frequently "talks" through his puppet, Junior. As Anu struggles to find a house, he offers his own flat and moves to his outhouse. Despite loving Anu, he lacks the courage to tell her. Bharani, Johnny's neighbour, visits and is surprised to see Anu. She learns that none of her letters had reached Bharani, since they were intercepted by his mentally-ill sister. Bharani saw the letters only after his sister died. By then it was too late as Anu had already married Ramanathan. Heartbroken, Bharani remained single.

Ramanathan's estranged mother Leelavathi realises Anu is her daughter-in-law. She regrets her son's behaviour; exploiting her anonymity, she obtains work as Anu's maid. Anu renews her relationship with Bharani. Leelavathi also supports Anu's decisions and advises her to move ahead in life. They decide to marry and a date is fixed for a civil wedding.

Ramanathan comes to Madras as Anu's boss, seemingly repentant and wanting to redress his wrongs. He does not reveal that he is Anu's ex-husband to Bharani, who reveals his plans to marry Anu. Johnny learns about Anu and Bharani's love; though disappointed, he continues to support Anu. Leelavathi convinces Anu to discard her "mangala sutra" and marry Bharani. But on the scheduled day, Anu falls ill and does not turn up at the marriage registrar's office. Bharani comes to her house, where he is disappointed to see Ramanathan taking care of Anu. Three men — Ramanathan, Bharani and Johnny — vy for her.

Ramanathan seeks forgiveness and expresses his desire to re-marry Anu. When Anu's colleague Rajathi, who knows Leelavathi, visits Anu, she is stunned to see Leelavathi employed as her maid. Despite Leelavathi's earlier pleas not to reveal her identity, Rajathi does so out of frustration. Shocked, Anu seeks Leelavathi's forgiveness. She goes to meet Johnny to seek his advice. Johnny finally courageously reveals his love for Anu through Junior. Anu expresses her inability to accept his love, but seeks his continued support as a friend. Noticing Anu's predicament and Ramanathan's continued involvement in her life, Bharani decides to move away from her and goes abroad for his musical programmes.

Ramanathan's reformed behaviour and Leelavathi's sacrifices make Anu agree to become Ramanathan's wife once again. When she reaches his home, Leelavathi reveals that Ramanathan has not really changed; he had staged this drama to stop her marriage to Bharani. When another woman shows up with her child claiming to be Ramanathan's wife, Anu realises Ramanathan's hidden agenda. Anu rushes to meet Bharani, but is too late by then, as Ramanathan has convinced Bharani to marry his rich fan Gayathri, and the engagement takes place.

Anu confronts Ramanathan; he reveals that he could not tolerate his ex-wife living happily, hence he ensured that all her dreams are shattered. Anu quits her job and plans to leave Madras. Johnny makes all arrangements for her travel to Trivandrum, her destination. When the train leaves, Anu is shocked to see Leelavathi also onboard. Leelavathi says this is the only way she can find solace for the sins of her son. Anu and Leelavathi embrace.


Kamal Haasan learnt the art of ventriloquism in order to portray his character perfectly. Both Haasan and Raghuram worked as choreographers for the film. The song "Junior Junior" was picturised on Haasan's character using a puppet named Junior. While not shooting his scenes, Rajinikanth would watch Kamal's acting and learn from it to improve his own acting.

The soundtrack was composed by M. S. Viswanathan and lyrics were written by Kannadasan. Viswanathan composed the song "Angum Ingum" within 15 minutes. The song is set in the Carnatic raga known as Dheerashankarabharanam, while "Kaatrukkenna Veli" is set in Bala Nandhini. Rediff wrote "K. Balachander once again shows his ability to use music as a narrative technique and the songs tuned by M. S. Viswanathan were all big hits, particularly "Kaatrukkenna Veli", "Junior" and "Angum Ingum".

In 2003, Rediff wrote, "A tad stagey by today's standards, this film still has much to recommend it". Four years later, Rediff wrote, ""Avargal" was considered a progressive and radical film by the seventies' standard. Rajnikanth gave a classic performance projecting a combination of two contrasting facets of villainy – both openly sadistic and wily. He actually outdid himself as the wily scheming man". In 2011, after Balachander had been given the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, Rediff named it one of Balachander's best and wrote, ""Avargal" is yet another film that portrayed a strong female protagonist". A writer from The Hindu in 2011 commented about the film, "I emerged highly impressed. The characterisation was fascinating and the acting underplayed to perfection. There's the sadistic husband played to perfection by Rajnikant, the wife who walks out portrayed by Sujatha whose eloquent eyes mirrored pain even when she smiled and Kamal who mesmerised as a Malayali ventriloquist, silently admires Sujatha". Malathi Rangarajan of Hindu wrote: "Avargal is yet another film in which Sujatha scored a ton, despite the powerful presence of Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan and Ravikumar" and also praised Rajni's performance as "one of his best till date". The Tamil magazine "Ananda Vikatan", in a review dated 13 March 1977, appreciated the film, mentioned that it was a different attempt, and that though the film was narrated with many flashbacks, with Balachander's touches they were not a burden to follow.


The film is widely regarded as one of the finest that Balachander had directed. Baradwaj Rangan while analysing the dominance of female characters in Balachander's films included "Avargal" as one among them. Clips from "Avargal" were screened along with clips from other films such as "Server Sundaram" (1964), "Iru Kodugal" (1969), "Arangetram" (1973), "Aval Oru Thodar Kathai" (1974) and "Azhagan" (1991) at a function held in Balachander's honour at Tiruchirappalli in January 2015, a month after his death.

Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri

Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri () is a 1977 Indian Tamil-language drama film directed by S. P. Muthuraman and written by Panchu Arunachalam. It is based on the novel of the same name by Maharishi. The film stars Sivakumar, Rajinikanth and Sumithra. It focuses on two friends with conflicting characters and their conflicting lives.

"Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri" was notable for casting Rajinikanth and Sivakumar as a hero and antihero respectively, contrary to the roles they played in earlier films. It was released on 9 September 1977. The film shocked audiences who were used to seeing Rajinikanth and Sivakumar in their usual roles; nevertheless, it was a commercial success, and won two Filmfare Awards: Best Tamil Film and Best Tamil Director for Muthuraman. The success of "Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri" led to Rajinikanth playing more positive roles in films.

Nagaraj and Sampath are garment salesmen and roommates in Tirunelveli. While Sampath is a straightforward person who believes in honesty, Nagaraj is a womaniser, in contrast to Sampath who believes in true love. Sampath's lover Raji, while fleeing from a rogue bull, dies due to an accident. A depressed Sampath attempts suicide, but Nagaraj stops him, and Sampath decides to stop selling garments, instead confining himself to remaining Nagaraj's assistant.

Aboard a train bound for Madras, Nagaraj and Sampath encounter Muthu, a temple trust clerk who has a suitcase full of cash. But Muthu dies "en route" of a heart attack and Nagaraj steals his suitcase, over Sampath's objections. Muthu's sister Bhuvana visits them at Nagercoil to enquire about the lost cash (which is all black money). Nagaraj denies knowing anything, but Bhuvana remains suspicious. He pretends to love her; Bhuvana falls for his lust and has sex with him.

Nagaraj uses some of the black money to open his own garment store. To make the rest of the money legitimate, he decides to marry Manohari, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. Bhuvana, pregnant by Nagaraj, refuses to abort the baby and wants Nagaraj to marry her, but he refuses. To save Bhuvana's honour and help his friend, Sampath marries Bhuvana but they only share a platonic relationship, while Nagaraj marries Manohari and his business flourishes.

Sampath wants to have a physical relationship with Bhuvana but she rejects him, saying he is like a god to her. Sampath raises Bhuvana's son as his own. Meanwhile, Nagarajan and Manohari yearn for a child as the former has now become impotent due to his excessive libido. Nagaraj demands that his son be given to him for adoption but Bhuvana refuses.

When the child becomes ill and needs an injection, Nagaraj enters into a bargain that he would give the medicine from his pharmacy, provided it is agreed that the child is given to him in adoption. But Sampath arrives on time to deliver the injection and the child is saved. A short while later, Sampath succumbs to cardiac arrest, the result of years of excessive smoking and drinking. Bhuvana prefers to live as his widow.


Writer Panchu Arunachalam and director S. P. Muthuraman initially wanted Rajinikanth to play a small role in a low-budget film. But after meeting him, the duo found him to have "brightness" and decided to cast him in "something bigger, better". The film was "Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri", an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Maharishi. Produced by N. S. Mani under the banner M. A. M. Films, its screenplay was written by Arunachalam. The film was the first collaboration of Rajinikanth and Muthuraman.

This film had a role swap as Sivakumar, then known for playing clean and positive characters, played an antihero while Rajinikanth, then an established villain, played a positive character. Muthuraman said he deliberately cast Rajinikanth against type since he wanted to "experiment with his acting skills". He also explained that his decision to shoot the film in black-and-white, rather than colour, was budget-related because "colour film had to be imported and was very expensive". Since Rajinikanth was not fluent in Tamil at that time, he was trained by S. L. Narayanan, who was popularly known by the prefix "Vaadhyar". Cinematography was handled by Babu. The film was edited by R. Vittal, and its final length measured .

Ilaiyaraaja composed the music for the film. The song "Vizhiyile" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Natabhairavi, and "Poo Thendrale" is set in Rageshree. In June 2013, A. Muthusamy of Honey Bee Music released a 5.1 surround sound version of the soundtrack.
"Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri" was released on 9 September 1977. The film shocked audiences who were used to seeing Rajinikanth in negative roles, and Sivakumar in heroic roles. Nevertheless, it won the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Film and Muthuraman won the Best Tamil Director award at the same ceremony. Rajinikanth's performance won him the Thirai Kathir Award for Best Supporting Actor. In 1978, the critic from "Film World" stated that although "Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri" dealt with social questions, it "neither had the motivation nor the justification very much essential to make a film realistic; at best [it] appeared frivolous."

The success of "Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri" paved way for Rajinikanth the opportunity to do more hero oriented films. Although Sivakumar's fans disliked seeing him play a negative character, he received numerous offers to play negative roles following this film's success, and felt accepting to play Nagaraj was a mistake; he elaborated, "I do not wish to be typed either as a goody- goody leading man or a villain. I would like to act all types of roles." Film producer and writer G. Dhananjayan wrote that it is one of five films Rajinikanth considers "close to his heart"; the other four are "Mullum Malarum" (1978), "Aarilirunthu Arubathu Varai" (1979) and "Enkeyo Ketta Kural" (1982) and "Sri Raghavendrar" (1985).

Ravi (Vijayakumar) is happily married to Savitri (Latha). Savitri's brother Ramesh (Rajinikanth) has come from Singapore, and they all go to Ravi's estate for a vacation. And that night starts Savitri's terrible ordeal. An apparition is visible only to her eye; an eerie song and the sound of anklets make themselves heard only to her ears. And before she realizes what is happening, another spirit enters her body, driving out her own spirit!

Overnight Savitri's persona itself changes; she talks, walks and behaves like a different woman. Ramesh is puzzled at the change, and keeps a watch on her. He follows her, as she wanders all over the hills with the easy familiarity of a person who has lived there all her life. He sees her shed tears over two names carved on a tree trunk; the fading legends "Radha" and "Ravi" tell the tragic tale of love and loss. He follows her as he goes to a humble cottage and eavesdrops as she introduces herself to the incredulous old woman (Pushpalatha) as her dead daughter Radha. It was only due to her unrequited love that she was hovering as a banshee so far, she explains. She tells excitedly that in the 5 days before new moon, if she can have a physical union with Ravi even once, she would be alive again. And if she didn't succeed? Well, she would push Ravi down the same waterfall where she had met her end, so that they could unite in the other world. 

In the old disused bungalow of Ravi, Ramesh sees a picture of Radha and listens to a cassette as well. He confronts Ravi with the photo, and Ravi tells all- how he fell in love with Radha (Padmapriya), the daughter of the late factory supervisor. They roamed all over the hills, even as the lofty knolls were passive spectators to their love. With steadfast determination, Ravi manages to get his father's (V. S. Raghavan) acceptance. But when he rushes back with the happy tidings, he finds only her body- she had met a watery grave trying to escape from the clutches of her evil suitor Ranga (Kannan). Armed with the facts now, Ramesh thwarts off the attempts of the possessed Savitri's attempts to sleep with Ravi. 

The first night she dresses provocatively and sings a song of seduction in the bedroom. Ramesh knocks the door and pulls Ravi out telling him that there was a call that the factory is on fire. And the second night, he dissolves some strong sedatives in Ravi's glass of milk. The third morning, in the labour day gathering where they are special invitees, the transformed Savitri dances and sings with abandon. That night, she takes Ravi to their summer cottage, but her plan goes awry again when Ramesh sets it on fire.

On the next night, Ravi is returning home when Ranga waylays him to settle old scores and hits him on the head. Ramesh rescues him in time. Of course, that night too passes without Radha's schemes seeing success. The last night, its do or die for Radha, and so she puts the vigilant Ramesh to sleep and lures Ravi out with a soft song of invitation. Savitri's displaced spirit crying out ‘Anna! Anna!’ and the barking dog wake up Ramesh and soon he is in pursuit as Radha sings and leads Ravi up the hill. In the end, good triumphs over evil.


The music was composed by M. S. Viswanathan. All the songs were written by "Kaviyarasu" Kannadasan.
The Sri Lankan journal "Tribune" stated, "Rather spoofy and crispy, this film directed by Durai, cashes in on the popularity of [Rajinikanth] of "Thee" fame who at his best, is a mere passenger in the story proper."

In May 2015, music director Bharadwaj commented on "Ennadi Meenakshi", "I’ve always believed that songs should express some emotion, some feeling. This song is a perfect example of what I believe in.

Mullum Malarum

Mullum Malarum ( "The Thorn and the Flower" [or] "Even a Thorn Will Bloom"; ) is a 1978 Indian Tamil-language drama film written and directed by J. Mahendran. Produced by Venu Chettiar and V. Mohan, the film stars Rajinikanth, Sarath Babu, Fatafat Jayalaxmi and Shoba. It marks Mahendran's directorial debut and is partly based on Uma Chandran's novel of the same name, which was serialised in the Tamil magazine "Kalki" in 1966. "Mullum Malarum" tells the story of Kali (Rajinikanth), a winch operator of a cable trolley who dotes on his sister Valli (Shoba) since they were orphaned, and clashes with his boss Kumaran (Sarath Babu).

Mahendran read only part of the novel, and developed the screenplay as he wanted, making a visually-focused film without formulaic Tamil cinema conventions he disliked such as melodrama, overacting, excessive dialogue and duets. Since Mahendran had no previous directing experience, cinematographer Balu Mahendra, who was already an established director, assisted him with the screenplay, dialogue, camera angles, casting and editing. Principal photography lasted for about 30 days, taking place primarily in Sringeri, Karnataka, though some scenes were also filmed in Ooty, Tamil Nadu. The film was edited by D. Vasu, and the soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja.

"Mullum Malarum" was released on 15 August 1978. Although it opened to tepid box-office earnings, positive reviews from critics and favourable word of mouth in later weeks helped make it a success with a theatrical run of over 100 days. The film received praise primarily for Rajinikanth's performance, Balu Mahendra's cinematography, Ilaiyaraaja's music, Mahendran's writing and establishing Tamil cinema as a "visual medium". It won the Filmfare Award for Best Film – Tamil, the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Film and Rajinikanth won the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for his performance.

"Mullum Malarum" became a breakthrough for Rajinikanth as an actor and a milestone of Tamil cinema for focusing prominently on visuals and realism without the formulaic Tamil cinema conventions that Mahendran disliked. He continued following this style in all his later films. The film's success inspired a Malayalam remake titled "Venalil Oru Mazha" in 1979, and a Hindi version titled "Pyari Behna" in 1985.

Orphaned at a young age, Kali and his sister Valli grew up on the streets and were street performers. Kali played the drums and Valli perched herself atop a pole balanced by an older boy. Kali frequently gets angry at people who he thinks lack empathy for the socially or financially deprived. As adults, the siblings live in a hilltop village where Kali works for a powerhouse in the valley below. From a shed in the village, he operates a winch for a cable trolley which ferries employees to work. The powerhouse's new divisional engineer, the rule-abiding but fair Kumaran, notices Kali offering free rides to unauthorised townspeople. When he orders the passengers out, citing rules of operation, Kali becomes angry and stops the trolley half-way downhill. Kumaran shrugs off this act with a knowing smile.

On a nearby canal's bank, Valli meets a young woman, Manga, who, along with her mother, has arrived from a drought-stricken town, Ilaiyangudi. The mother is looking for work, and both women are hungry—Manga ravenously so, a fondness for food becoming one of her primary characteristics. Valli feeds and shelters them for the night, and asks Kali about allowing them to use the vacant house next door. Meanwhile, Kali roughs up his fellow employees whom he suspects of snitching on him to Kumaran. Kali is given a final warning by Kumaran as a prelude to serious disciplinary action.

While Kali is at work, Manga appears, picks up his watch and teasingly declares she will run away with it. A chase ensues, taking them through the woods and into the river. Waist-deep in the water, Kali retrieves the watch and rushes back to the shed. During his absence, a child living in the valley has needed medical attention. After the emergency alarm at the shed has rung for several minutes, a passerby steps in to operate the winch. The child is transported back in the trolley and dispatched to a hospital. The following day, Kumaran suspends Kali from his job for ten days for gross misconduct.

That evening, Kali goes to the nearby Mullimalai to assuage his anger at Kumaran among the Badagas, joining them in singing and dancing. While staggering back home drunk, Kali passes out on an unlit street. A truck drives over his left arm, which is amputated at a city hospital. As a result, Kumaran fires Kali since he can no longer perform his job adequately with one arm. At Valli's prompting, Kali and Manga agree to marry; they have a simple wedding ceremony held at the local temple. Kumaran attends and brings a present of cash, which Kali spurns, but Manga accepts.

Kumaran becomes attracted to Valli. After determining her willingness for marriage, he requests permission from Kali who asks him to return the following day. Later that day, Kali corners Murgesa, a local grocer who is known for flirtatious behaviour, and offers him his sister's hand in marriage. An engagement ceremony for Murgesa and Valli is arranged. At the ceremony, Manga angrily interferes in the main ritual, which makes Kali furious at his wife. He physically assaults her repeatedly, but Manga remains firm in her opposition.

The next day, Manga convinces Kumaran and Valli to marry without Kali's knowledge, but he accosts their wedding party on its way to the temple. Kali accuses his sister of abandoning him because of his handicap. Valli is filled with guilt and rushes into his arms. Kali reminds the onlookers that he remains the most important man in his sister's life. Although he still dislikes Kumaran, Kali's self-esteem is restored, and he offers his blessings for the marriage.


Despite the success of his projects in the 1970s including "Thanga Pathakkam" (1974) and "Aadu Puli Attam" (1977), screenwriter J. Mahendran had become disillusioned with the mainstream Tamil cinema, which he criticised for its obsession with commercial success, routine melodrama, excessive dialogues, duets and a typical climax. He decided to take a sabbatical from screenwriting, but was under constant pressure from film producers to write for them. It was then that Mahendran began soliciting novels to adapt, one of which was Uma Chandran's "Mullum Malarum" (1966). First serialised in the Tamil magazine, "Kalki", it won the first prize in "Kalki"s novel competition for the magazine's silver jubilee in 1966. While reading the novel, Mahendran was attracted by the protagonist Kali's job as a winch operator and his highly self-respecting character. He read until the chapter where Kali loses his arm to a tiger, and developed the screenplay completely according to his own wish. Unlike the novel, in Mahendran's screenplay Kali loses his arm when it is run over by a truck. Additionally, the novel ends with the deaths of Kali and his wife Manga, which Mahendran did not include in his screenplay.

Upon completion, Mahendran did not immediately pitch his story to any investors, but instead "quietly filed it away", as he believed that no producer would want to produce a film that lacked all the formulaic Tamil cinema conventions. It was only after producer Venu Chettiar of Ananthi Films approached Mahendran with an offer that he pitched "Mullum Malarum", describing it as a brother and sister story. Chettiar accepted the story without listening to it fully and wanted Mahendran to both write and direct the film. Under the assumption that Chettiar had only accepted due to his belief that Mahendran would make a successful brother-sister film like the melodramatic "Pasamalar" (1961), Mahendran refrained from disclosing to him that what he envisioned was radically different, with more focus on visuals than dramatics. The film marked Mahendran's directorial debut, with Chettiar and V. Mohan producing it. Ramasamy was signed as art director, and D. Vasu as editor. Ramachandra Babu declined when approached by Mahendran to be the cinematographer, and Ashok Kumar, whom Ramachandra Babu suggested, could not accept to work on the film. Mahendran was unable to find a worthy cinematographer until actor Kamal Haasan introduced him to Balu Mahendra, who agreed to work on the film, making his debut in Tamil cinema. Haasan worked as a production manager on the film.

After the release of "Aadu Puli Attam", Mahendran wanted Rajinikanth, who portrayed the film's antagonist, to act as the male lead in his directorial debut film. Though Chettiar remonstrated against the actor's suitability for the role due to his dark skin and typecasting as a villain, he reluctantly capitulated after Mahendran intransigently declared that he could not possibly direct the film without him, believing him to be tailor-made for the part. After directing the Kannada film "Kokila" (1977), Balu Mahendra wanted its lead actress Shoba to act in his first Tamil film. She was eventually cast as Kali's sister Valli, alongside Sarath Babu as the divisional engineer Kumaran and Fatafat Jayalaxmi as Manga.

Mahendran cast Venniradai Moorthy as Murugesa, the philandering grocer, and Samikannu was given a role as Maayaandi, one of Kali's henchmen. Male supporting roles were played by S. A. Kannan, Pazhaniyappan, Dasaradan, Rangamani, Sarathi, Santhanam, Kumarimuthu, Jothi Shanmugham, Chellappa, Amalraj, Poondigiri and Vairam Krishnamoorthy. Female supporting roles were played by Santhamma, Jayakumari, Vijaya, Jaya, Pushpa, Radha, Prema, Vasanthi, Leela and Kala.

"Mullum Malarum" was filmed on 35 mm ORWO colour film. It was shot primarily in Sringeri, Karnataka, with additional filming in Ooty, Tamil Nadu; principal photography lasted about 30 days. Chettiar initially refused to let Mahendran shoot in Sringeri, citing financial constraints, but Mahendran's friend Pazhaniappan convinced Chettiar and agreed to pay for the Sringeri shooting schedule. Once while passing through Pondicherry, Mahendran witnessed a game of Uriyadi, which inspired him to include two Uriyadi scenes in the film which were not originally part of the script. Mahendran also decided to characterise Manga as a "meen paithiyam" (meaning a "foodie who loves fish") after being inspired by Sringeri's marine environment. Balu Mahendra stated that he avoided incorporating the usual hero-heroine dancing into the film because he thought it was like "watching two drunken monkeys dancing". Instead, he allocated music to the background when the lead characters expressed their emotions. Since Mahendran had no previous directing experience, Balu Mahendra, who was already an established director, assumed responsibility and responded to Mahendran's suggestions for screenplay, dialogue, camera angles, casting and editing. He shot the film predominantly using natural light.

According to Mahendran, Chettiar never arrived at the shooting spot; he expected a melodramatic, dialogue-heavy film, and would have shelved the project had he known about Mahendran's filmmaking style. Sarath Babu was originally supposed to lip sync the full "Senthazham Poovil" scene, picturised on Kumaran and Valli, but Mahendra and Mahendran agreed on a montage after the actor performed a line or two. During the filming of the climax where Kali lets Kumaran marry Valli despite their enmity, Sarath Babu disputed the part where Kali professes to still dislike Kumaran, leading him to storm off the set. When he was brought back by the producer, he tempestuously confronted Mahendran, who informed him that Kali dislikes Kumaran till the end. He offered the possibility of filming it with Kali saying those words without Kumaran present, but Sarath Babu ultimately appeared. After watching the film's double positive, Chettiar was perplexed by the lack of melodrama and lengthy dialogues, since he hired Mahendran as director due to his success as a dialogue writer and did not expect such a visually-focused film. Mahendran had yet to film a scene set before "Senthazham Poovil" but Chettiar, discontent with the budget escalating, refused to finance it until he was won over by Haasan who financed the scene, and filming was completed. "Mullum Malarum" final reel length was .

Film critic Naman Ramachandran likened Kali's relationship with Valli to how flowers need thorns for protection. According to critic Baradwaj Rangan, the title "Mullum Malarum" can be interpreted in two ways: "the thorn and the flower", which describes Kali and Valli; and "even a thorn will bloom", which foreshadows how Kali softens at the end. Mahendran considered the latter to be the real meaning of the film's title. S. Rajanayagam, author of the 2015 book "Popular Cinema and Politics in South India: The Films of MGR and Rajinikanth", described Kali as the thorn and flower in the film; he characterised Kali as an "angry young man with a kind heart" who does not admit mistakes, despite having committed acts such as breaking car headlights and allowing people to ride the trolley, in violation of the powerhouse's rules. He noted that films like "Mullum Malarum" stereotype the poor as "all that is pristine and traditional", and leave the "overall socio-economic system" which made them poor unchallenged, but within this system, "the hero will be 'richer' in terms of his moral uprightness". Journalist Kavitha Muralidharan wrote that most of Mahendran's films show characters with contrasting personalities, citing the docile Valli and the garrulous Manga in "Mullum Malarum" as examples. Regarding this, Mahendran said, "I only show them as they are in real life".

According to film historian , "Mullum Malarum" explores "the extreme Oedipal possessiveness of a married brother for his younger sister". Thoraval said this was a recurring theme in Indian films starting with "Bahen" in 1941. Ramachandran noted that Kali, like Rajinikanth's character in "Bairavi" (1978), is responsible for his sister's welfare. Unlike "Bairavi", the siblings in "Mullum Malarum" are not separated; this leads Kali's protectiveness of Valli to the brink of obsession. Ramachandran regarded egotism as one of "Mullum Malarum" central themes, identifying Kali as the alpha male of his community. According to an article published in "Cinema Vision India", the film stresses "that people changeand they must". Ramachandran noted that when Kali's arm is amputated, he feels helpless and emasculated, and Kumaran becomes an easy target. Kali refuses to see the benefits of his sister marrying a wealthy and educated man, even when Manga asks for his consent, but sees the error of his ways when Valli abandons her wedding party to join her brother: "My sister has shown all of you that I am the most important person in her life. I need only that happiness for the rest of my life. And it is with that pride and arrogance that I give my permission for my sister to marry". Writing for "Frontline", Venkatesh Chakravarthy noted that the film ends with Kali relenting to Valli's desire to marry the man she wishes but not before he tells Kumaran that he still dislikes him, "which makes the film open-ended with a feel that life goes on".

"Mullum Malarum"s soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja, with lyrics by Panchu Arunachalam, Gangai Amaran and Kannadasan. Unlike most Tamil films of that time, the film does not include any duets. The song "Adi Penney" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Madhyamavati. "Raman Aandaalum" is set in Mayamalavagowla, and "Senthazham Poovil" is set in Bowli. "Maan Iname", sung by Ilaiyaraaja, does not feature on the soundtrack. Elements of "Raman Aandaalum" were later used in "Machi Open the Bottle", composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja for "Mankatha" (2011).

"Mullum Malarum" was released on 15 August 1978. As the film's commercial performance during its first few weeks was poor, both Mahendran and Rajinikanth summoned Chettiar to further publicise the film to improve its revenues. He declined, caustically replying that an unsuccessful film cannot be pushed in the market however much publicised, and a successful film needs no publicity. During its third or fourth week of release, positive magazine reviews and favourable word of mouth spread; "Mullum Malarum" became a commercial success, with a theatrical run of over 100 days. Chettiar later apologised to Mahendran, who in turn thanked him for letting him make the film.

After watching the film and being impressed with Rajinikanth's performance, his mentor, director K. Balachander wrote in a letter of appreciation that he was proud to have introduced him as an actor in Tamil cinema. Balachander's letter has been described by Sify as Rajinikanth's "most prized moment and possession". After its success, "Mullum Malarum" was remade in Malayalam by Sreekumaran Thampi as "Venalil Oru Mazha" (1979) and in Hindi by Bapu as "Pyari Behna" (1985). It was also dubbed in Telugu as "Mullu Puvvu", and released in 1979.

"Mullum Malarum" was well received at the time of its initial release, with commentators applauding it for establishing Tamil cinema as a "visual medium". The writer of a 25 August 1978 review in "The Hindu" appreciated the film for not having the "usual formula of fights, duets, intrigues and cabaret dances". The reviewer further noted that Rajinikanth showed "his mature artistry in a portrayal of a turbulent illiterate worker with a blind passion for his sister". They also praised the performances of Shoba and Jayalaxmi, called Balu Mahendra's camera work a "feast for the eyes", and Ilaiyaraaja's melodies "delicious"; although the reviewer criticised the first half of the film for moving at a "leisurely pace", they said the second half was "eventful". The Tamil magazine "Ananda Vikatan", in its 3 September 1978 review, applauded the performances of Rajinikanth and Sarath Babu, along with Balu Mahendra's cinematography and Ilaiyaraaja's music. The reviewer also praised Mahendran's filmmaking skills and the fact that he told the story in a sharp manner without long dialogues, likening the film to Kurinchi flowers due to their rarity and rating it 61 out of 100.

After watching the film, M. G. Ramachandran—the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu—told Mahendran that he had no words to express his happiness, and that Mahendran set a new trend in Tamil cinema with "Mullum Malarum". Ramachandran stated that Mahendran had reached a milestone beyond expectations. He added that Mahendran demonstrated clearly that cinema is a "visual medium". Ramachandran commented that the depiction of brother-sister relationships in film up to this point were full of dramatics, even in his own, but "Mullum Malarum" stood apart in its realism. He said the final scene was new not only to Tamil cinema but also to Indian cinema. Ramachandran lauded Rajinikanth's realistic acting and hoped the ﬁlm would mark a big turnaround in his career.

"Mullum Malarum" won the Filmfare Award for Best Film – Tamil, and two awards at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards: Best Film, and Special Prize for Rajinikanth, who also won the "Arima Sangam" Award for Best Actor. The film was screened at the 1979 International Film Festival of India as part of its Indian Panorama section.

"Mullum Malarum" attained cult status in Tamil cinema. It was a breakthrough for Rajinikanth as an actor and a milestone of Tamil cinema for focusing prominently on visuals and realism without the formulaic Tamil cinema conventions that Mahendran disliked. Mahendran continued following this style in all his later films. According to K. Balamurugan of Rediff.com, the film established that Rajinikanth "can be a director's actor too" and widened his fan base "from youngsters to the families and the women". In December 2013, "The Times of India" said that with this film, Rajinikanth "dispelled whatever doubts remained about his acting ability". Rajinikanth himself considers "Mullum Malarum" one of his five most favourite films and Mahendran his favourite director.

"Kali" (alternatively, Kaali) became Rajinikanth's most-frequent onscreen name; his characters in "Kaali" (1980), "Kai Kodukkum Kai" (1984) and "Petta" (2019) also shared that name. In October 2015, director Pa. Ranjith said that Rajinikanth's characterisation in "Mullum Malarum" was a "lesson" of sorts for him, and the actor's character in Ranjith's "Kabali" (2016) was influenced by Kali in "Mullum Malarum". The film's score has been regarded as one of the best of Ilaiyaraaja's career by commentators; the songs "Senthazham Poovil" and "Raman Aandalum" in particular, remain hugely popular. The latter was used in the climax sequence of "Petta".

Thappida Thala

Thappida Thaala (, ) is a 1978 Indian Kannada language film directed by K. Balachander. It stars Rajnikanth and Saritha in the lead roles.

It was simultaneously made in Tamil as "Thappu Thalangal". 
It was later remade in Malayalam as Kazhukan

Devu (Rajnikanth), a local thug whose weapon of choice is a bicycle chain he sports casually around the neck. He charges 30 to slice a finger, 300 to chop a hand, 3000 for the leg, and ten times as much to dispose off the whole body. On one of his nightly rounds, he is pursued by a cop and seeks refuge at a whorehouse run by a hooker Sarasu (Saritha). Despite her vehement protests, he stays put and leaves only at daybreak, but her persistent cough stays with him. At a theatre, Devu watches an advertisement for Glycodin Cough Syrup and proceeds to buy her a bottle. They bond over the cough syrup and philosophize late into the night, exchanging notes on their immoral lifestyles.
Devu's assault on a trade union leader delivering medicine to a critically ill worker leads to a mishap. Watching the wailing of the widow of the worker, he is traumatized and breaks down at Sarasu's place. In an inspired moment, he suggests they remap their lives and chart a moral course. Sarasu is attracted by the notion of giving up prostitution and leading a normal life as Devu's wife, though she wonders if they will be able to pull it off. The couple go to great lengths to secure a job for Devu and lead a normal life, but there are too many skeletons in the closet. Devu is no longer feared for his might, and Sarasu's past clientele continue to haunt the joint. She gets a loan for Devu from his evil brother Soma, who continues to harass her on that pretext. In a particularly traumatic sequence of events, Sarasu is raped by Soma as a helpless Devu watches, pinned down by Soma's henchmen. The couple resolve to repay Soma's loan, and Devu undertakes a botched robbery attempt. Devu is imprisoned and in his absence, Sarasu has an abortion. The couple's plans for normality never attain fruition. The inevitable return to lives of vice is especially tragic and heartbreaking.

Balachander excels at the verite portrayal of the daily drama in the lives of pimps, hookers, and their varied clientele, as well as the politicians who hire thugs like Devu to achieve their aims through violence. Devu's inherent goodness is contrasted with his "evil twin", a stepbrother Soma who thwarts his every attempt at morality and finally succumbs at Devu's hands. Kamal Haasan has an interesting cameo as a Hindi speaking client of Sarasu. Balachander skewers middle-class morality and takes potshots at the hypocrisy of do-gooders. In the final analysis, the film is an indictment of society at large, for not allowing lesser mortals to rejoin society and return to a life of normality.


Vijaya Bhaskar composed the music for the soundtrack album that consists of three tracks.

Aval Appadithan

Aval Appadithan () is a 1978 Indian Tamil-language drama film directed by C. Rudhraiya in his directorial debut, and co-written by him with Somasundareshwar. The film was produced by Ragamanjari in association with the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute. It stars Sripriya in the lead role with Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth in supporting roles, while Ilaiyaraaja composed the film's music. The plot revolves around Manju (Sripriya) and the difficulties she faces in her life, due to her romantic relationships, resulting in her developing an aggressive and cynical nature towards men.

"Aval Appadithan" was released on 30 October 1978, on Diwali day. Although the film received positive critical reception, it was not a box office success at the time of its release. However, the film began to develop an audience after directors P. Bharathiraja and Mrinal Sen commented positively about it. The film was noted for its stylish filmmaking, screenplay, and dialogue, a large portion of it being in English.

"Aval Appadithan" was the first film made by a graduate of the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute. It received the second prize for Best Film at the 1978 Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, while Nallusamy and M. N. Gnanashekharan won the Best Cinematographer award. Additionally, Sripriya received a Special Award for the Best Actress of 1978. In 2013, CNN-News18 included the film in its list, "The 100 greatest Indian films of all time".

Manju (Sripriya) was raised in a dysfunctional family that consisted of a timid father and a philandering mother; she hurtles from one disastrous affair to another, leading to her degenerating into a cynical woman. Into her life enter two radically different men. One of them is her boss, Thyagu (Rajinikanth), who owns the advertising agency she works for. He is a stereotype of the successful man: money-minded, opinionated, arrogant, and a male chauvinist. In sharp contrast is Arun (Kamal Haasan), who has come to Chennai from Coimbatore to make a documentary on women. Sensitive and sincere, he believes his job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at the cynical attitudes of Manju and Thyagu.

Manju has been drafted by Thyagu to assist Arun in his documentary. As Arun and Manju start working together, Arun begins to understand Manju's complex personality. She tells Arun about her unfortunate past relationships: How she was molested by her uncle, the ending of her first relationship in college when her lover left her by marrying another woman for the sake of employment, and how her second love, Mano (Sivachandran), a Christian priest's son, used her to satisfy his needs and lust, calling her "sister" in front of her parents. These incidents have led to her present attitude towards men. Arun later shares these conversations with Thyagu, who warns him to steer clear of such women.

Inevitably, Arun falls for Manju. However Manju incurs Thyagu's wrath when he overhears her reprimanding her office staff for commenting on her character. When Thyagu also comments about her, she resigns from her job. When he learns of this, Arun requests Thyagu to re-employ her. Thyagu simply laughs and says that she is already back, after which Manju seems to have a change of heart and starts courting Thyagu. Arun is devastated to see that she has turned out to be just the sort of woman that Thyagu earlier said she was opportunistic, money-minded, and fickle. When he asks her about her contradicting stands in life, she responds by saying that is the way she is and will be.

The truth finally emerges that Manju was merely baiting Thyagu to teach him a lesson. When Thyagu starts believing that Manju has fallen for him, he attempts to take advantage of her at a party banquet, but she rebukes and slaps him, after which Thyagu runs away in fright. However, this revelation comes too late for her, as Arun, who is disillusioned with her behaviour, has already married a small town girl (Saritha). When Manju tells her aunt about the attempt to humiliate Thyagu and its ramifications, her aunt tells Manju that she deserved it for leaving behind a golden opportunity to start a new life. In a final discussion in Thyagu's car, Manju asks Arun's wife, "What do you think of women's liberation?". Arun's wife replies, "I don't know". Manju replies with a cynical, "that is why you are happy". The film ends with Manju standing on the road as the car carrying Thyagu and the married couple pulls away from her. A voice-over says, "She died today. She will be reborn tomorrow. She will die again. She will be reborn again. That is how she is".


C. Rudhraiya, whose former name was Aarumugam, was introduced to Kamal Haasan by writer and director Ananthu. The three shared an interest in the works of Robert Bresson, Jean-Luc Godard, Roman Polanski, and Roberto Rossellini. Godard and Bresson were part of the French New Wave, which focused on films based on social ideas, some of which were iconoclastic in nature. Rudhraiya, Haasan, and Ananthu wanted to experiment with their ideas in Tamil. This was Rudhraiya's first film as director; quite radical in his approach, he wanted to change the conventions of Tamil cinema at that time. K. Rajeshwar was writing a script dealing with women's liberation at that time, and it was decided that his script would be used for the film; the result was "Aval Appadithan". It was the first film made by a graduate of the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute. The initial script by Rajeshwar consisted of two pages.

"Aval Appadithan" was the debut film for both Nallusamy and M. N. Gnanashekaran, who jointly handled the film's cinematography. Vanna Nilavan co-wrote the screenplay with Somasundareshwar and Rudhraiya. The film was co-produced by Ragamanjari, in association with the students of the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute. Sripriya, who played Manju, was initially unsure about acting in the film due to her busy schedule at that time, and only agreed to do it on Haasan's insistence. According to Rajeshwar, the characterisation of Manju was inspired from a woman he met and who had similar radical beliefs. In "" (2012), Rajinikanth recalled, "if Kamal had said, “Don’t cast Rajini”, nobody would have taken me [in "Aval Appadithaan"]." Sivachandran was cast as Manju's former lover Mano.

Throughout the film, the cinematography made extensive use of shadows and close up shots to emphasise the moods of the characters. Jump cuts were frequently used as well. Overall, 8,230 metres of film negative was used to make the film, and the team incurred a cost of 20,000 for exterior shooting equipment. The scenes where Arun interviewed women for his documentary were real scenes, improvised with women they would meet at colleges and bus stops, and shot using the live-recording method. The film uses a sharp contrast of black and white colours to lend a surreal atmosphere to it, and none of the actors used make-up.

Filming proceeded smoothly as almost all of the dialogues were ready by the time team went for filming the scenes. The camera angles were pre-planned as well. Haasan shot the film in his spare time, as he was involved in over 20 other films as an actor during the production of "Aval Appadithan". Before a shot, Haasan discussed the scene with Ananthu and Rudhraiya on how Godard would have done it. The film was shot in two-hour sessions over a period of four-five months. The opening scene where Haasan looks into the camera and says "Konjam left-la ukaarunga" (English: "Sit a little to the left, please.") was meant as a sign to the audience to support gender equality. According to the Tamil newspaper "Dinamalar", "Aval Appadithan" was shot in 20 days.

"Aval Appadithan" explores a number of themes such as women's liberation, sex and the chauvinistic attitude of males. Its central theme is on women and their plight in society, as exemplified by Manju and her relationships. Born to a timid father and a mother with loose moral values, she is also subsequently affected by two people she becomes romantically involved with. One, her college mate, left her to marry someone else for the sake of a job; and the second is Mano, the son of a Christian priest, who used her to satisfy his lust and then trivialised their relationship by calling her "sister" in front of her parents. These relationships result in her becoming wary of men and developing an aggressive nature towards them. Conversations related to matters like the status of women in contemporary (1978) times and the nature of humankind are frequently seen in the film.

Sociologist Selvaraj Velayutham says in his book, "Tamil Cinema: The Cultural Politics of India's Other Film Industry", that Manju's characterisation was "brought out entirely verbally by her". Velayutham believes the film to be constantly resorting to "existing myths about women and relationships: that a wayward mother destroys her children; that a woman who speaks the 'truth' is always alone; that men are scared of her; that the woman who is different is confused, not sure of herself and is only seeking love from a man but does not know it herself." Velayutham further asserts that the film's only positive aspect is "it does not expose the body of women in the way it is customary" and that Manju could have avoided her unfortunate set of circumstances "if only she had a 'proper' mother!"

Artist V. Jeevananthan compared "Aval Appadithan" to other films whose central theme was women, such as "Charulata" (1964), "Aval Oru Thodar Kathai" (1974), and "Panchagni" (1986), while also labelling them as "classics that put the spotlight on women." Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, in their book "Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema", say the film was also inspired by the 1972 film, "Dhakam", which starred R. Muthuraman and Pandari Bai. They also note that "Aval Appadithan" uses a "fluid narrative style" and music to mix flashbacks with vox-pop and "glossy pictorialism". The film is an exception on stereotypes of women, as shown by paralleling an independent woman, Manju, and a pious traditional woman: Manju gets into problems while Arun's wife is happy. The last lines of the film where Manju asks "what do you think of 'women's liberation'", Arun's wife answers, "I don't know", to which Manju says "that is why you are happy", send the message that one will inevitably get into trouble if one exhibits assertive behaviour.

Kamal Haasan's character, Arun, is an early version of a metrosexual male sensitive and sincere. Rajinikanth's character, Thyagu, is the exact opposite of Arun money-minded, arrogant, and a womaniser. This is evident when Thyagu says to Arun: "Women should be enjoyed, not analysed." According to Rajinikanth, Thyagu was very much similar to him in real life — he too smokes and drinks, but applies "vibhuti" (sacred ash) on his forehead. This implies that Thyagu was also an atheist. According to film critic Naman Ramachandran, Thyagu was, by far, Rajinikanth's most entertaining character up to that point in his career; his character was a self-confessed chauvinist who believed that men and women can never be equal, and that women are merely objects to be used for men's pleasure. When Arun calls Thyagu "a prejudiced ass", Thyagu responds by saying, "I am a male ass," with the dialogue being in English. His opinion of Sripriya's character, Manju, is seen when he says (also in English), "She is a self pitying sex-starved bitch!"

"Aval Appadithan" soundtrack and score were composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The soundtrack was released under the label of EMI Records. Although Ilaiyaraaja was busy, he agreed to compose for "Aval Appadithan" at the insistence of Rudhraiya and Haasan. After the recording session of "Ninaivo Oru Paravai" from "Sigappu Rojakkal" (1978), Ilaiyaraaja asked Haasan to record "Panneer Pushpangale" that same afternoon. During the recording session, Ilaiyaraaja suggested that Haasan tone down the opening notes; when Haasan sang perfectly as per his suggestion, Ilaiyaraaja accepted Haasan's next rendition of the song.

Ilaiyaraaja wanted Vannanilavan to write the lyrics for "Uravugal Thodarkathai", but since Vannanilavan had difficulties in writing the lyrics, he opted out. He was subsequently replaced with Gangai Amaran. The song was reused in the film "Megha" (2014). It poignantly captures the vulnerable moments in the life of a woman, while "Panneer Pushpangale" and "Vaazhkai Odam Chella" have a "philosophical touch." According to Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai, author of the article "The 1970s Tamil cinema and the post-classical turn", the songs were used "to punctuate the interiority of the characters rather than as a spectacle or as a device to move the plot forward." In June 2013, A. Muthusamy of Honey Bee Music enhanced the songs from their original version on the film's soundtrack album to 5.1 surround sound.

"Aval Appadithan" was released on 30 October 1978, on Diwali day. It was released in only two theatres in Chennai: Kamadhenu, and either Emerald or Blue Diamond in the Safire Theatre complex.

The film received generally positive reviews from critics. On 19 November 1978, the magazine "Ananda Vikatan" criticised the gaps in the film, particularly the abundance of English dialogue, the excessive focus on naturalism, and lower standard of technical work (especially the cinematography). Despite these perceived flaws, the magazine still appreciated the film, stating that the actors immersed themselves into their characters, leading to them not really acting before the camera but living the characters.

Retrospective response to the film has also been positive. K. Balamurugan of Rediff said, "It was what we would call parallel cinema these days." Writing for "The Hindu", Baradwaj Rangan commented and remarked on how "different" the film was by saying: ""Aval Appadithan" was different. The shadowy black-and-white cinematography was different. The dialogues, which were more about revealing character than advancing plot, were different. The frank handling of sex and profanity ('she is a self-pitying, sex-starved bitch!') was different. The documentary-like detours were different. The painfully sensitive, feminist hero was different. Rudraiah was different." D. Karthikeyan of "The Hindu" wrote in December 2009 that "Aval Appadithan" would "remain etched in every film lover's memory by showing the best of Rajnikanth's acting skills." Director Mrinal Sen remarked, "The film was far ahead of its times." Critics also appreciated the live-recording method of shooting the sequences where Haasan's character, Arun, interviewed women for his documentary.

The film did not initially receive a big response from the public, and was not a box office success upon its release. However, after the directors P. Bharathiraja and Mrinal Sen wrote positive comments on it, people began to watch the film and appreciate it, leading "Aval Appadithan" to develop a cult following. In November 2014, Haasan defended the financial failure of the film, ""Aval Appadithan" was a guerilla attack on the industry by insiders like me. It slipped through their fingers, so to speak. With all the attention that films get these days, I doubt we can get away with such a film any more."

The film was awarded the Second Prize for Best Film at the 1978 Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. At the same ceremony, Nallusamy and M. N. Gnanashekharan won the award for Best Cinematographer, and Sripriya received a Special Award for Best Actress of the year.

"Aval Appadithan" is one of only two films ever directed by Rudhraiya; the other was "Gramathu Athiyayam" (1980). "Aval Appadithan" was noted for its stylish filmmaking, screenplay and dialogue, a large portion of it being in English. The dialogues were sharp and were considered almost vulgar. It also broke the style of filmmaking followed up until that time. Sripriya included it in her list of favourite films she had worked in. Rudhraiya's daughter, Ganga, noted that "Aval Appadithan" help her face life in the real world.

In a July 2004 interview with T. Saravanan of "The Hindu", director Karu Pazhaniappan rated "Aval Appadithan" as one of the best films he had ever seen. In May 2007, K. Balamurugan of Rediff included "Aval Appadithan" in his list of "Rajni's Tamil Top 10". In July 2007, S. R. Ashok Kumar of "The Hindu" asked eight Tamil film directors to list their all-time favourite Tamil films; two of them – Balu Mahendra and Ameer – named "Aval Appadithan". Thiagarajan Kumararaja named "Aval Appadithan" as an inspiration for his film "Aaranya Kaandam" (2011). S. Shiva Kumar of "The Hindu" included the film on his December 2010 list of "Electrifying Rajinikanth-Kamal Haasan films" with "Moondru Mudichu" (1976), "Avargal" (1977) and "16 Vayathinile" (1977). In April 2013, CNN-News18 included the film in its list, "The 100 greatest Indian films of all time". As of July 2013, Sruti Harihara Subramanian, founder and trustee of The Cinema Resource Centre (TCRC), has preserved many promotional stills and photographs of the film's production.

In November 2013, "The New Indian Express" included the film in its list, "Kamal Haasan's most underrated films". In February 2014, CNN-News18 included "Aval Appadithan" in its list, titled "12 Indian films that would make great books". In "Kathai Thiraikathai Vasanam Iyakkam" (2014), the hero's writing team discusses the theme of "Aval Appadithan" to get ideas for their film's story, until they realise that the film was a failure at the time of its release. Indo-Asian News Service, in their review of Sripriya's directorial venture "Malini 22 Palayamkottai" (2014), a film about a rape victim, stated, "Sripriya, who was once a successful actress, played a rape victim in Tamil drama "Aval Appadithan". It's probably because of that role and the effect it had left on her, she handles this subject with great care and understanding that most of her peers would lack." In January 2015, K. Rajeshwar said, "I was told that if "Aval Appadithan" were made today, it would be a blockbuster. I don’t agree, for it’s still taboo for a woman to talk about her sexual encounters. The profile of the audience should change." In July 2016, "The Hindu" included "Aval Appadithan" in its list of "roles that defined Rajinikanth the actor".

Satyamoorthy takes him to his treasury room where he had stored his huge wealth and tells him the secret of unlocking his lockers. The fake priest pretends to give a sacred sheet and instructs to place it inside the locker which shall protect the stuffs. As Raja suspected, the priest sends the robbers at night to loot the wealth but Raja wakes up and fights with them and restores the looted property. Raja's repeated attempts to prove that the priest is fake goes vain as Satyamoorthy believes strongly that Raja protected the wealth only because of the divine power of the sacred sheet.

Raja once enters a ladies toilet by mistake and is caught by a girl who screams that Raja has come to misbehave. Raja wants to revenge for her behaviour with him and goes to her father Sivaraman and lies that he is the lover of his daughter Hemavathy (Rati Agnihotri) aka Hema.

After some days, Raja and his crew set a camp in a place near a small village. They get help and assistance from an innocent village girl Vasanthi (Vanitha Krishnachandran), a vegetable seller. Fews days later at a night Raja's group hears a drum sound. Raja and his friend follows the sound which ends in a sacrificial ground and sacrifice of Vasanthi by a group of people. Raja screams on seeing Vasanthi being beheaded and alerts the men. They were chasen by the men and Raja escapes with his group from them. Next day Raja goes to police station and gives complaint of the incident. On police investigation, Raja is shocked to hear there was no evidence of the existence of the girl Vasanthi.

Raja's men were further tortured by those men and Raja loses one of his friend. Raja gets into deep investigation and end up at a place of a Rajarishi (Sangili Murugan) who is believed to be great saint. Raja meets his brother and his father-in-law on their to visit of Rajarishi and Raja goes with them. Raja finds that Rajarishi is not a saint but a grand looter and head of the robbery gang who make wealthy people handover the property to him by giving a sacred drink called 'Anandha Rasam' which is actually alcohol mixed stuff. Satyamoorthy's daughter Radha is declared dead by a snake bite. But the girl has not died and made to believe that she has died as she is wanted by Rajarishi for a human sacrificial ritual.

The soundtrack and score were composed by Ilayaraja while the lyrics for the tracks were written by Kannadasan. The film's story and dialogues was written by Visu and the screenplay was written by K. Balachander. Babu and R. Vittal handled cinematography and editing respectively.

In the movie, the son wants his father to repent for the latter's mistake even if he respects his father very much. The film revolves around Chakravarthy, middle-aged businessman who is a womaniser. In the process, he rapes a girl Radha. Rest of the film revolves around Chakravarthy's son and Radha teaching an lesson to his father to mend his ways. The film was released on 15 August 1981 became successful at the box office. The film received critical acclaim with Rajinikanth's performance as a middle-aged womaniser being widely praised. The movie title “Netrikkan" is believed to be inspired from the popular conversation between Sangam age poet Nakkeerar and Lord Shiva in Thiruvilayadal movie. The poet questions Lord Shiva, who is in the disguise of another poet, about the quality of the poem written by the Lord himself. Angered by Nakeerar's question, the Lord reveals himself by opening His Third eye. Still poet Nakkerar is fearless, replying, “Netrikkan thirappinum kuttram kuttrame” which means 'A mistake is a mistake even if u are God (One who has the Third Eye)'. The film was dubbed in Telugu as "Musalodiki Dasara Pandaga".The film was unofficially remade in Hindi as Rangeela Raja starring Govinda.

The story revolves around Chakravarthy (Older Rajini) who is a successful textile businessman in Coimbatore. He is a big womaniser (perhaps his only weakness) and picks up any women he wants. Other characters being wife Meenakshi (Lakshmi), his son Santosh (also Rajini) and his daughter Sangeetha (Vijayashanthi). It doesn't take long for Santosh to find his father's provocative behaviour and tries to mend his father's ways. Radha (Saritha) gets introduced as a candidate for PRO (Public Relations Officer) interview and eventually gets selected and is sent to Hong Kong for training. Chakravarthy unable to tolerate his son's growing menace also sets off to Hong Kong for a holiday. Here he meets Radha and at one point ends up raping her. Chakravarthy flies back to India where he is met with a number of changes which all points out to the new General Manager. This person turns out be Radha who has joined with Santosh to teach Chakravarthy a lesson for lifetime. How the duo succeed in changing Chakravarthy's behaviour forms the crux of the story.


"Netrikann" is the inaugural production of K. Balachander's Kavithalayaa Productions. It had Rajini playing the roles of father and son. Unlike other films where the father's character is portrayed as a positive person and the son is a bit of a wastrel, in this film it is the father who is lecherous and the son is the good guy. Balachander produced the film as he felt that the concept had a lot of scope for Rajini to perform. Muthuraman was initially hesitant to direct the film but Balachander encouraged him to direct. Cameraman Babu introduced the mask shots through this film, the film had 90 mask shots.

Soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja

"Indiaglitz" wrote that the film: "trumpeted Rajini is one of the finest wholesome actors of Tamil cinema".

A dialogue spoken by Rajinikanth, "Naan eshwaran illa da, Koteeshwaran" (I'm not just God. I'm a rich God) attained popularity.

"Pokkiri Raja" is a remake of the Telugu film "Chuttalunnaru Jagratha" (1980), and was Rajinikanth's first film opposite Raadhika. M. Saravanan of AVM Productions expressed a desire to remake it in Tamil; he wanted Rajinikanth to play the male lead. Rajinikanth refused to act in the film as he was unimpressed with the Telugu film and character but later relented after Saravanan requested him to act. Saravanan called Visu who, after watching the film, said it could be remade well with minor changes and further developed Radhika's character.

The film was colourised using Eastmancolor. It was Muthuraman's final film as actor and he portrayed a negative role. The crew brought in a dubbing artist to imitate his voice.

The soundtrack was composed by M. S. Viswanathan, with lyrics by Kannadasan and Gangai Amaran.

"Pokkiri Raja" was released on 14 January 1982, Pongal day. The film became a commercial success, running for over 100 days in theatres. Along with "Murattu Kaalai" (1980), it was responsible for establishing Rajinikanth as a full-fledged action hero.

Balu slowly gets accustomed to the village life and learns to work hard and develops a good relation with Gangadharan and his family. During his stay, he spars with an arrogant rich girl, Sumathi.

Johnny (1980 film)

Johnny is a 1980 Indian Tamil-language crime thriller film, written and directed by J. Mahendran. The film stars Rajinikanth, Sridevi and Deepa. Featuring Rajinikanth in a dual role, it revolves around a parsimonious barber who must flee from the police after meeting with a look-alike con artist. "Johnny" was released on 15 August 1980, and became a commercial success.

Archana is a popular singer, and Johnny is her ardent fan. Johnny is a con artist who does petty thefts on greedy people to close the loan taken by his father. He never misses Archana's concerts, and she notices this. A tender love develops between the two, but Johnny is guarded in accepting Archana's love due to his not-so-clean background. But one day Johnny accepts Archana's love when she proposes to him. Meanwhile, Vidyasagar, a parsimonious barber and lookalike of Johnny, lives a lonely life with his assortment of pet animals. He falls for Bhama, another loner, and they both plan to marry. Vidyasagar notices his lover's infidelity and kills her in rage. Knowing about his lookalike Johnny and knowing that he is wanted by the police, he tries to pass on the murder charge to him and gives up on women as well looking at them in low light. Both of them are chased by police, Johnny hides in a forest, and Vidyasagar tries to pass off as Johnny by taking refuge in Archana's house. Archana gets hurt by the curt behaviour of Vidyasagar (who is in the guise of Johnny) and is confused on the change in Johnny's behaviour. Finally, Vidyasagar realises his folly, understands that not all women are the same, as well as their love, and unites the lovers by getting caught by the police, taking responsibility for Johnny's crimes.



Mahendran had a strong desire to make a film with Rajinikanth at that time, hence he made this film simultaneously with "Nenjathai Killathe". As the producer could not provide the equipment and facilities for the climax scene with a song, Mahendran was forced to use stock shots and manage to shoot with the limited facilities offered. However, by beautifully mixing the close up shots with stock shot, the scene came out well and was appreciated by everyone. This was the first time for which popular artist Jayaraj designed the costumes. He first drew the illustrations of scenes with costumes and then got them stitched, bringing in newness and style in Rajinikanth's look, which attracted the masses.

The scene where Archana proposes to Johnny was shot in Ooty in a bungalow at midnight. When the scene was shot, the whole unit was silent, they saw only the characters of the film, not Rajini and Sridevi. After the scene was shot, Rajini appreciated Sridevi's acting and mentioned to Mahendran that though he tried, she overshadowed him in the scene. Because Rajinikanth played two roles, he was billed twice in the opening credits, as "Rajinikanth and Rajinikanth". To play Vidyasagar, Rajinikanth sported a centre-parted hairstyle and wore box-framed glasses.

Kavitha Muralidharan of "The Hindu" wrote that most of Mahendran's films, including "Johnny", "offer a prismatic view of relationships". She contrasted "Johnny" with Mahendran's earlier film "Uthiripookkal" (1979), saying that while that film's protagonist was "rigid in his relationship with people", the title character of "Johnny" is "as vulnerable as a woman could be".

The soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The song "Aasaiya Kathula" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Sindhu Bhairavi, and "Kaatril Endhan" is set in Keeravani. It was reused twice in Telugu as "Naa Sari Sogasari" in "Chakravyuham" (1993) and as "Raathri" in "Gundello Godari" (2013). It was also reused as "Sannata" in the Hindi film "Shamitabh" (2015). The song was lifted by Anand–Milind as "Dil Mere Udaas" for "Angrakshak" (1995). "Kaatril Endhan Geetham" was reused as "Naina Bole" in "Aur Ek Prem Kahani" (1996).
"Johnny" was released on 15 August 1980. Piousji of the magazine "Sunday" wrote, "Sridevi not only looked smart, but came out with a convincing performance and [Rajinikanth] too was quite impressive" in "Johnny". "Ananda Vikatan" gave the film a C+ rating. The title "Johnny" gave the impression of an action entertainer, hence it disappointed audiences in the first two weeks. However, the emotionally moving story, intense acting by Rajinikanth and Sridevi and memorable songs attracted the audience, so the film picked up in the third week and became a success, running for over 100 days in theatres.

Seetha, a young woman, is travelling via train with her nephew Raju to an estate to attend her job interview as a nanny to the estate merchant Manohar's daughter. Her co-passenger tries to rape her but suddenly he is shot dead. Seetha sees the murderer and clearly remembers his face and reports the murder to Moorthy, a police inspector. Then she is appointed for the nanny position and she and Manohar's daughter Shoba grow fond of each other.

Manohar, who is extremely fond of his daughter returns from his journey. Seetha meets him, only to realise that he is the murderer she saw on the train. Manohar threatens Seetha not to tell anyone and makes sure to prevent her from leaving his estate as she is keen on reporting him to the police.

Seetha tries many times to escape but is always caught. She does not even tell the police when she meets them as Manohar threatens to kill Raju if she did. Later, Seetha somehow sees beneath the rough, mean Manohar and grows fond of him but is confused why such a nice man is acting so arrogantly.

In flashbacks, Manohar and Kumudha fell in love and married, shortly thereafter their daughter Shoba was born. Kumudha's uncle Chandru, who was eager to marry Kumudha but who was sent to jail by Manohar as he tried to kill both Manohar and Kumudha was released from jail as his term had finished.

Manohar also reveals that the man he killed on the train was Chandru.

Seetha now understands his acts and vows not to tell anyone. Moorthy's colleague is curious about Seetha; she said that she remembered the face and was eager to find the murderer, but now she had told him she has forgotten the face, hence he suspects Seetha to be the murderer, and Moorthy agrees with his belief. On Shoba's birthday, Manohar is to announce that he is to hand over all his wealth to Seetha and surrender to the police, but before this the police arrive and try to arrest Seetha. Manohar saves her by confessing to the murder, leading to his arrest.

The movie tells the story of two brothers, Raja and Ravi, who follow different career paths: Raja is a smuggler and Ravi the policeman who is asked to hunt Raja down. Raja (Rajinikanth) and Ravi (Suman) are the sons of a trade unionist (AVM Rajan), who was defeated and disgraced by the management of his firm using his family as bait.

Raja, the elder brother, grows up with an acute awareness of his father's humiliation and is victimized for his father's supposed misdeeds. In the process of fighting for his rights, Raja, who starts out as a boot polisher and becomes a dockyard worker in his youth, becomes a smuggler and a leading figure of the underworld.

The film opens with the strong leadership of trade unionist (AVM Rajan), who works hard to enhance the lives of struggling laborers. He lives in a modest home with his wife, Seetha (Sowcar Janaki), and their two young sons, Raja (Rajinikanth) and Ravi (Suman). The trade unionist, however, is blackmailed by a corrupt businessman who threatens to kill his family if he does not cease his activities. Forced into compliance, the trade unionist is thus attacked by the very same laborers who once supported him. His family is also persecuted by the angry workers who brand young Raja's arm with the words: "My Father Is A Thief." The trade unionist then runs away forcing Seetha and her two children into destitute poverty. Not knowing what else to do, Seetha brings her children to Chennai and struggles as a day labourer to care for her now homeless boys.

Raja, the elder brother, grows up with an acute awareness of his father's failure and is victimized for his father's supposed misdeeds. In the process of fighting for his rights, Raja, who starts out as a boot polisher and becomes a dockyard worker in his youth, becomes a smuggler and a leading figure of the underworld. He also sacrifices his own education so his brother Ravi can study. Ravi is an excellent student and grows up to become an upright police officer. He is also dating Radha (Sripriya), the daughter of a senior police officer (Major Sundarrajan). On the Commissioner's suggestion, Ravi applies for employment with the police, and is sent for training. Several months later, he is accepted by the police, and has a rank of Sub-Inspector. Raja, on the other hand, becomes involved with Anita (Shobha), a woman whom he meets at a bar. When Anita becomes pregnant, Raja decides to abandon his life in the underworld, marry her, and confess his sins. He also hopes to seek forgiveness from his mother and brother. When Ravi returns home, he finds that Raja has become a businessman overnight, has accumulated wealth, and a palatial home. When Ravi finds out that Raja has acquired wealth by crime, he decides to move out along with his mother. One of his first assignments is to be apprehend and arrest some of Chennai's hardcore criminals and smugglers which includes his brother, Raja — much to his shock, as he had never associated his very own brother of having any criminal background. Ravi must now decide to proceed on with apprehending Raja, or quit from the police force. However, when Anita is brutally murdered by rival members of the underworld, Raja loses all sense of rational behavior and brutally murders his rivals in revenge for Anita's death, leading him to be branded a criminal forever. Their mother, who had sided with Ravi despite the fact that Raja was her favorite, is tormented by Raja's decisions and rejects him. The two brothers meet for a final showdown, where Ravi kills Raja. Raja dies in his mother's arms seeking forgiveness and Ravi is awarded for pursuing justice.

Nartanasala

Nartanasala () is a 1963 Indian Telugu-language historical drama film directed by Kamalakara Kameswara Rao. The film was produced by actress C. Lakshmi Rajyam and her husband C. Sridhar Rao under the Rajyam Pictures banner. It featured N. T. Rama Rao, Savitri and S. V. Ranga Rao in the lead roles. Relangi Venkata Ramaiah, Mukkamala, Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy and Dandamudi Rajagopal play supporting roles among others. Susarla Dakshinamurthi composed the film's soundtrack and background score. M. A. Rahman and S. P. S. Veerappa served as the cinematographer and editor respectively. T. V. S. Sarma was the film's art director.

Based on the "Virata Parva" of the Indian epic "Mahabharata", "Nartanasala" focused on the trials of the Pandavas in the last year of their exile. The Pandavas assumed different identities and lived incognito in Virata Matsya Kingdom. The Kauravas wished to reveal the Pandavas' real identities so that they would repeat another exile of 13 years in a cyclic fashion. The issues faced by the Pandavas and their wife Draupadi at Matsya due to various factors, notably Virata's brother-in-law Kichaka form the rest of the story.

The majority of "Nartanasala" portions were filmed in the sets erected at Vauhini and Bharani studios in Madras (now Chennai). Produced with a budget of 400,000, "Nartanasala" was released on 11 October 1963 in 26 centres. The film was a commercial success, completing a 100-day run in 19 centres and a 200-day run in two centres. It was also dubbed into Bengali and Odia languages. "Nartanasala" won the National Film Award for Second Best Feature Film and the Filmfare Award for Best Film – Telugu. At the third Afro-Asian Film Festival held at Jakarta in 1964, "Nartanasala" received two awards: best male actor (Ranga Rao) and best art director (Sarma). For the April 2013 centennial of Indian cinema, CNN-News18 included "Nartanasala" in its list of "The 100 greatest Indian films of all time".

The Pandavas complete 12 years of forest life as a part of their 13-year exile stipulation of a rigged dice game they were defeated in by the Kauravas. As per the rule, in the 13th year, the Pandavas and their wife Draupadi have to assume different identities and live incognito until the upcoming Vijayadashami. In case their real identity is unveiled, they have to repeat their 12-year exile again. That would give a chance to the Kauravas to prohibit the Pandavas from attacking and gaining the reigns of the Kuru Kingdom for a longer period, and possibly forever. The Pandavas choose the Matsya Kingdom ruled by Virata, a kind hearted but weak spirited king. They hope to find employment in the king's palace.

Arjuna, one of the Pandavas, recollects a curse which could help him stay incognito for one year. In the past, Arjuna was felicitated by Indra, the king of deities for gaining the divine weapon, "Pashupatastra", from Lord Shiva through dedicated devotion. The celestial dancer Urvashi falls in love with Arjuna, but he rejects her advances as he considered her a motherly figure. Feeling insulted, Urvashi cursed him to lose his masculinity and turn into an eunuch. Indra arrived and asked Arjuna to treat this curse as a blessing in disguise as the 13th year is arriving. Taking this into account, Arjuna turns into a transgender dance teacher Brihannala.

The remaining assume different identities based on their strengthsYudhishtira as the advisor and dice player Kankubhattu, Bhima as the cook Valala, Nakula as horse groomsman Damagranthi, Sahadeva as cowherd Tantripala. Draupadi meets Virata's wife Sudeshna at a temple. She introduces herself as Sairandhri, an ill-fated woman married to five Gandharvas and requests a job in her palace. Sudeshna agrees and promises that Sairandhri would never be used to perform unethical tasks and jobs. The Pandavas too join Virata's palace in these disguised forms and perform various duties. The Kauravas are in search of the Pandavas and their cousin Krishna learns about this. Arjuna's son Abhimanyu wishes to convey the same to the Pandavas and Krishna reluctantly agrees. Before sending him to Matsya, Krishna warns Abhimanyu not to reveal his real identity. Abhimanyu falls in love with Virata's daughter Uttaraa but does not reveal any details of his. Brihannala, who teaches dance to Uttaraa, learns this and is happy. Uttaraa's brother Uttara Kumara too, wishes to see their alliance turn into a reality and waits for the opportunity.

Sudeshna's brother and Matsya's chief army commander Kichaka returns victorious from a conquest. Kichaka sees Sairandhri and is mesmerised with her beauty. He warns Sudeshna of dire consequences if Sairandhri does not willingly submit herself for unison. As Kichaka is the supreme power of Matsya, Virata and Sudeshna do not dare to oppose. Sairandhri warns and pleads to Kichaka several times, which bear no result. One night, Valala disguises himself as a woman and waits in the dance hall. Believing the woman to be Sairandhri, Kichaka enters the hall and is killed by Valala. Valala also kills Kichaka's hundred brothers who attempt to kill Sairandhri by making her perform Sati with Kichaka's corpse.

The Kaurava's learn about Kichaka's death due to a woman married to five Gandharvas in mysterious circumstances. They suspect that the Pandavas are hidden in Matsya and launch an attack on the kingdom's cattle. With all the soldiers engaged in war with Kauravas' allies, Virata's palace is almost empty. When Kauravas attack the remaining cattle, Uttara Kumara swears to fight against them. However, after watching their military troops, Uttara Kumara loses his confidence. Brihannala, who is his charioteer, volunteers to fight if Uttara Kumara handles the chariot, to which Uttara Kumara agrees.

Before the war, Brihannala asks the chariot to be directed to a shami tree ("prosopis cineraria") where the Pandavas' divine weapons are hidden. The 13th year ends on that day and Brihannala regains his form of Arjuna. On realising who Brihannala is, Uttara Kumara is happy to serve him. Arjuna then uses the "Sammohanastra" weapon, which puts the Kaurava army to sleep. The cattle are rescued and the Pandavas declare that their 13-year exile has been successfully completed. Krishna visits Matsya and the marriage of Uttaraa with Abhimanyu is finalised.


"Nartanasala" was produced by actress C. Lakshmi Rajyam and her husband C. Sridhar Rao under the banner Rajyam Pictures. The film's story was based on "Virata Parva", one of the eighteen books of the Indian epic "Mahabharata". Rajyam and Rao felt that barring "Keechaka Vadham" (19161918) and "Vijayadasami" (1937), no other Indian film dared to explore "Virata Parva" and found it a unique premise. Also, the belief that reading "Virata Parva" in Telugu-speaking lands would result in heavy rainfalls made the subject a culturally significant one. Samudrala Raghavacharya wrote "Nartanasala" script and Kamalakara Kameswara Rao was chosen to direct the film. "Nartanasala" was Kameswara Rao's first mythological film.

Susarla Dakshinamurthi composed the film's music; M. A. Rahman and S. P. S. Veerappa served as the cinematographer and editor, respectively. T. V. S. Sarma was the film's art director. Raavi Kondala Rao, one of the assistant directors, wrote the dialogue for the comedy portions on Kameswara Rao's insistence. He also added the character of Vaalatulya (played by Allu Ramalingaiah), which was absent in the original script. Though Kameswara Rao offered to credit Kondala Rao as the first assistant director, the makers altogether left his name out later.

Rajyam and Rao approached N. T. Rama Rao to play Arjuna role in the film. Rama Rao was happy to play Arjuna, but was hesitant to take up Brihannala part; he felt that even a slight misstep would result in rejection by the audience. Rajyam assured that Sarma's sketches would help Rama Rao look authentic. Sarma designed the look based on eunuch's statues in major temples and opted for Keralite hairstyles. Bengali makeup artist Haripada Chandra was signed to work on Rama Rao's work. After getting approval from his mentor Kadiri Venkata Reddy on Brihannala's look, Rama Rao agreed to be a part of the film's cast.

Savitri and S. V. Ranga Rao were signed to play the other key roles of Draupadi and Kichaka respectively. Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy, Dhulipala Seetarama Sastry, Mukkamala and Relangi Venkata Ramaiah played supporting roles. Wrestlers Dandamudi Rajagopal and Nellore Kantharao were signed to play Bhima and Jeemutha Mallu respectively. Kanta Rao made a brief appearance as Krishna and Rajyam played his sister Subhadra. Sobhan Babu and L. Vijayalakshmi were paired to play the couple Abhimanyu and Uttaraa. This was Sobhan Babu's first of two films where he portrayed the character of Abhimanyu, the other being "Veerabhimanyu" (1965). On Rajyam's insistence, actress Kanchanamala made a cameo appearance. She shared the screen with Suryakantham in the film. It was Kanchanamala's last on-screen appearance.

The majority of "Nartanasala" portions were filmed in the sets erected at Vauhini and Bharani studios in Madras (now Chennai). All the musical instruments used in the film were borrowed from the Madras Sangeetha Vidyalaya. The war sequences in the climax portion were filmed at Gudur, a town in Andhra Pradesh; two cameras were simultaneously used to film the scenes. For the "Gograhana" (retrieving the kidnapped cows) episode, five thousand animals were brought with the help of Gogineni Venkateswara Rao. "Nartanasala" was produced on a budget of 400,000 with a runtime of 174 minutes.

When Raghavacharya fell ill, his son Samudrala Ramanujacharya (popularly known as Samudrala Jr.), wrote the monologue "Sandhaana Samayamidi Inkanu Sairandhri Raalede ..." (It is time for unison and Sairandhri hasn't turned up yet ...) for Ranga Rao. Since Brihannala was a dance teacher and Vijayalakshmi, who played Uttaraa, was a trained classical dancer, Rama Rao took two-hour long daily lessons from the film's choreographer Vempati Pedha Satyam for a month. Satyam also held a three-day rehearsals for Sobhan Babu with Vijayalakshmi to help him overcome his nervousness. For the scene where Sairandhri was tied to a pole and dragged on a cart, Kameswara Rao employed a body double. When the intended artist did not turn up, another was employed and the scene was filmed. This made Kameswara Rao remark, "so now we have a dupe for a dupe ".

Susarla Dakshinamurthi composed the film's soundtrack and background score. "Nartanasala" soundtrack, marketed by Saregama, consists of 21 tracks including songs, poems, and collection of selected dialogue from the film. Out of 21 songs produced, only nine are used in the film. Raghavacharya and Sri Sri penned the lyrics for the songs. P. V. Koteswara Rao of Bharani Studios worked on the re-recording and songs. RCA and Western Electric sound systems were used for the same.

The song "Salalitha Raaga Sudharasa" is based on the Kalyani raga of the carnatic music. The makers were initially reluctant with the song's classic nature and insisted to change it. When Dakshinamurthi and Raghavacharya completed work on a new version, Kondala Rao and Satyam requested the makers to retain the previous version. Due to the unavailability of singers Ghantasala and S. Janaki, Dakshinamurthi chose musician M. Balamuralikrishna and Bangalore Latha to provide the vocals. The song "Jaya Gana Nayaka" is a ragamalika composition and is based on three ragasGambhiranata, Todi, and Punnagavarali.

"Nartanasala" is one of Dakshinamurthi's critically acclaimed works in Telugu cinema. M. L. Narasimham of "The Hindu" noted that Dakshinamurthi's "melodious" background score contributed largely to the film's success. "Salalitha Raaga Sudharasa" gained the status of a chartbuster, while "Janani Siva Kamini" gained recognition as a prayer song. Other successful songs of "Nartanasala" were "Dariki Raboku", "Sakhiya Vivarinchave", "Evarikosam Ee Mandahasam", and "Naravara O Kuruvara".

"Nartanasala" was released on 11 October 1963 in 26 centres. Navayuga Films acquired the film's distribution rights. Katragadda Narsaiah of Navayuga worked on the film's posters and publicity. The film was commercially successful, managing to have a theatrical run of 100 days in 19 centres and 200 days in Hyderabad and Vijayawada. According to "The Hindu", "Nartanasala" complete theatrical run lasted for 25 weeks. The film's Bengali and Odia dubbed versions were commercially successful on par with the original. "Nartanasala" was adjudged the second best feature film at the 11th National Film Awards. It won the Filmfare Award for Best Film – Telugu. At the 3rd Afro-Asian Film Festival held at Jakarta in 1964, "Nartanasala" received two awards: best male actor (Ranga Rao) and best art director (Sarma).

In its 87th volume released in 1966, the now-defunct magazine "The Illustrated Weekly of India" noted Kanchanamala's cameo appearance, stating, "her delivery was as flawless as in bygone days and the years had not robbed her of charm". Reviewing "Nartanasala", the University of Iowa stated that the film "unfolds in near-operatic style reminiscent of many genres of Indian folk theatre". Rama Rao's performance as Brihannala was praised: "Rao manages the transition well, swishing about in glittery drag and affecting exaggeratedly feminine mannerisms". The reviewer also found Kanta Rao's portrayal of Krishna "suitably charming, with an enigmatic style". M. L. Narasimham of "The Hindu" noted that the film provided one of the most fulfilling performances for Savitri as Sairandhri. On its ninth anniversary, Telugu newspaper "Sakshi" praised the performances of Rama Rao and Ranga Rao as Brihannala and Keechaka respectively; the newspaper termed the former a "strange adventure" considering the actor's stardom.

"Nartanasala" success inspired filmmakers to explore the theme of a protagonist with a dark past living with a different identity in a place alien to him. The film's success also earned recognition to Padmini Priyadarshini (who played Urvashi in the film) as a dancer in South Indian cinema. In May 2012, Radhika Rajamani of Rediff.com mentioned "Nartanasala" for the letter N in her list, "The A to Z of Telugu Cinema". In November 2012, "The Times of India" listed "Nartanasala" along with other unrelated films such as "Missamma" (1955), "Mayabazar" (1957), "Gundamma Katha" (1962), and "Bommarillu" (2006) in the list "Telugu classics to watch along with family this Deepavali". The commentator for "The Times" praised the songs, the overall treatment and Ranga Rao's portrayal of Kichaka. For the April 2013 centennial of Indian cinema, CNN-News18 included "Nartanasala" in its list of "The 100 greatest Indian films of all time". In the Telugu film "Bhale Manchi Roju" (2015), the old theatre from where the villain (played by Saikumar Pudipeddi) operates is named "Nartanasala" after this film.

Rama Rao's son and actor Nandamuri Balakrishna announced "Nartanasala" remake in 2004. Apart from directing the remake, Balakrishna played a dual role in the remakethose of Arjuna and Kichaka. Soundarya was signed to play Draupadi with Srihari, Sarath Babu, Uday Kiran and Asin cast in supporting roles. The remake's principal photography commenced on 1 March 2004. The remake was shelved later due to the death of Soundarya in an accident. In an interview with "The Times of India" in August 2014, Balakrishna said that he could not imagine anyone other than Soundarya for the character and after her death, he called off the film with no intention to revive it.

Lava Kusa

Lava Kusa (also spelled as Lava Kusha) is a 1963 Indian bilingual Hindu mythological film directed by C. S. Rao and his father C. Pullaiah. The film's script was written by Samudrala Raghavacharya. The film was produced by Shankar Reddy under Lalita Sivajyothi films. The film was shot in both Telugu and Tamil languages with the same title, but with slight differences in the cast. The film was a remake of 1934 film of same name which was also directed by C. Pullaiah. The story is an adaptation of the Uttara Kanda from Ramayana. It revolves around the roles of Lava and Kusa, sons of Rama (N. T. R.) and Seetha (Anjali Devi). The Telugu version stars Kanta Rao, Shoban Babu, S. Varalakshmi, Kaikala Satyanarayana in supporting roles, replaced in that order by M. R. Radha and Manorama in the Tamil counterpart.

Production began in 1958 but was stopped due to financial constraints. When it restarted, C. Pullaiah's health was deteriorating, so his son C. S. Rao took over. The soundtrack features 27 songs, with the musical score primarily composed by Ghantasala and KV Mahadevan, and the lyrics by Vempati Sadasiva and Samudrala Raghavacharya (Telugu) and Maruthakasi (Tamil). The Telugu version of "Lava Kusa" was released on 29 March 1963, while the Tamil version was released the following month, on 19 April. The former won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu for that year. It was also dubbed in Kannada, and later in Hindi in 1974. This film was later remade with the title "Sri Rama Rajyam" in 2011.

This movie is based on Uttara Kanda which is the later part of Ramayana written by Valmiki Maharshi. It depicts the lives of Lava and Kusa, the sons of Sita and Rama. The story depicts Sri Rama Pattabhishekam and the brief period of Rama Rajyam, Rama sending Seeta exile on hearing the accusations of a washerman, Birth of Lava and Kusha, their visit to Ayodhya, Ashwamedha Yagna and conflict between Rama and his sons and Pattabhishekam of Lava and Kusha and Rama finally ending his Avatar.

A. Sankara Reddy wished to produce a film based on the Hindu epic "Ramayana" with N. T. Rama Rao and Anjali Devi in the lead roles after watching them play the roles of Rama and Sita in the song "Murisenu Lokamu" from "Charanadasi", the Telugu version of the 1956 Tamil language film "Mathar Kula Manickam". C. Pullaiah, who was planning to remake his 1934 Telugu language directorial "Lava Kusa", agreed to direct it for Sankara Reddy's Lalitha Sivajyothi films. The remake, also titled "Lava Kusa", is the first full-length colour film of Telugu cinema. Writer Vempati Sadasivabrahmam, who worked with Pullaiah for "Charanadasi", was chosen to write the remake's script. During the process, Sadasivabrahmam stayed faithful to the screenplay and the dialogue written for the original by Vallabhajosyula Ramanamurthy and Balijepalli Lakshmikantham respectively.

The production costs escalated because of Sankara Reddy's decision to make the film in colour. The film's production commenced in 1958 and got stuck due to lack of funds after completion of one-third of the planned portions. After five years, Sundarlal Nahata offered to provide funds in lieu of the film's distribution rights and B. Nagi Reddy provided studio facilities. By then, Pullaiah's health deteriorated and Sankara Reddy approached Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy to complete the film. Narasimha Reddy advised him to consider Pullaiah's son C. S. Rao. Rao was reluctant, opining that nothing dramatic was left for him to film. Pullaiah convinced Rao to take up the task, stating that the emotional scenes in Rama’s palace were of equal importance to the story.

"Lava Kusa" was filmed as a bilingual in Telugu and Tamil languages with differences in casting. Anaparthi Nagaraju and Viyyuri Subrahmanyam were cast as Lava and Kusa respectively in Telugu. For the Tamil version, they were replaced by Baby Uma and Master Murali. Subrahmanyam was cast after the makers saw him perform the same character in a play staged in Kakinada. He was a nine year old when the filming began and was 14 when the film released. Unlike Subrahmanyam, Nagaraju acted in a few films before "Lava Kusa"; Pullaiah offered him the role after observing his work. Nagaraju was eight years old when the filming began.

Kanta Rao was cast for the role of Lakshmana. When the actor was being diagnosed for eosinophilia and became obese, he was offered the role of Shatrughna. Rama Rao insisted Sankara Reddy to let Kanta Rao play Lakshmana, and Sobhan Babu was signed to play Shatrughna. Kaikala Satyanarayana, Chittor V. Nagaiah, and Arja Janardhana Rao were chosen to play the roles of Bharata, Valmiki, and Anjaneya respectively.

Pullaiah made Nagaraju and Subrahmanyam undergo training for an hour everyday and memorise the dialogues and lyrics of the songs. Filming used to begin by 7:00 AM and would go on till 9:00 PM. However, the duo was relieved an hour before to ensure that they could sleep properly. According to them, Rama Rao and Anjali Devi were "committed to the core". When none of the crowns designed for him were suitable, Rama Rao used the one he used in "Charanadasi" which costed 140. In a particular scene, Nagaraju was supposed to cry and glycerine was used. When it turned out to be ineffective, Anjali Devi slapped him and the scene was filmed. After its completion, she had to console him for almost fifteen minutes.

The climax sequences were filmed first, and because of delay in the film's production, the child artistes looked much aged in the earlier portions. When the scene of Rama embracing his sons was filmed, Pullaiah arranged two small tables and asked Rama Rao to hug Nagaraju and Subrahmanyam, who were standing on them. The duo stated that this incident was an example of Pullaiah's respect towards the lead character and the state of technology in use. Pullaiah’s associate G. V. R. Seshagiri Rao pointed to him that a pregnant Sita running towards Valmiki would look awkward, and the scene was reshot.

Soundtrack was composed by Ghantasala and lyrics by Vempati Sadasivabrahmam, Samudrala Raghavacharya & Kosaraju Raghavaiah.

All the tunes for all the songs for both languages are the same. The film has 37 songs and Poems (Padyam), many are very popular and memorable.

Soundtrack was composed by K. V. Mahadevan and Ghantasala and lyrics by A. Maruthakasi.

The film ran for 75 weeks uninterruptedly. This is an unbroken record. It was released in 26 centres and had a 100-day run in all the centers, which was a record and ran 150 days in all those centers and 175-day run in 18 centres. Due to the huge demand for the film from other centres in Andhra Pradesh, most prints had to be shifted to other centres. It had run for 100 days in 62 centres and 175-day run in 18 centres, grossing more than 10 million.


"Lava Kusa" is considered a classic of Telugu cinema. In January 2007, M. L. Narasimham of "The Hindu" listed "Lava Kusa" with "Mala Pilla" (1938), "Raithu Bidda" (1939), "Vara Vikrayam" (1939), "Bhakta Potana" (1942), "Shavukaru" (1950), "Malliswari" (1951) "Peddamanushulu" (1954) and "Mayabazar" (1955) as films impacting society and Telugu cinema. Rama Rao reprised the role of Rama in a number of films over a two-decade career.

During a programme "Telugu Cinema Prasthanam" organised by the film society of Vishakhapatnam, writer include actor Ravi Kondala Rao placed "Lava Kusa" among other cult films like "Raja Harishchandra" (1913), "Bhakta Prahlada" (1932), "Mala Pilla", "Devadasu" (1953) and "Pathala Bhairavi" during a speech on the role of Telugu cinema in the hundred years of Indian cinema. Bapu used "Lava Kusa" storyline in his 2011 film, "Sri Rama Rajyam". Debutant Jaya Sreesivan named his 2015 comedy film as "Lava Kusa" which had no similarity with the film.

Sati Sulochana

Sati Sulochana is an 1934 Indian Kannada-language film directed by Y. V. Rao. The film was released on 3 March 1934 and is the first talkie film in Kannada language. It is also the first film to be screened in the erstwhile Mysore Kingdom. It is a lost film.

"Sati Sulochana" is based on the character Sulochana from the Ramayana. She is the wife of Indrajit and the daughter-in-law of Ravana, the demon-king in Ramayana. The film tries to portray the goings-on of the war between the Hindu god Rama and Ravana as seen from the point of view of Sulochana. Ravana abducts Rama's wife Sita to his kingdom of Lanka, drawing Rama into a war. In the course of the war, Rama's brother Lakshmana is knocked unconscious by an arrow from Indrajit and is revived by a medicinal herb called Sanjeevani. The revived Lakshmana kills Indrajit and makes Sulochana a widow. Ravana's defeat by Lord Rama and the killing of Indrajit is viewed through the eyes of Sulochana. Unable to bear the pain of husband's death, Sulochana commits sati sacrifice.


The producer of the film was a Marwari businessman from Bangalore (a native of Ahore, Jalore District of Rajasthan) named Shah Chamanlal Doongaji, who started a film production company in Bangalore called South India Movietone in 1932. He decided to make a mythological movie called "Sati Sulochana" involving characters from the Ramayana like Ravana, Ravana's son Indrajit, Ravana's wife Mandodari and Indrajit's wife Sulochana. He engaged Yaragudipati Varada Rao to direct the film as well as play a character of Lakshmana, Bellave Narahari Shastri to write the screenplay, dialogues and lyrics. Nagendra Rao, who had previous exposure to films, was selected to play the role of Ravana and was given an additional role of production management. M. V. Subbaiah Naidu was selected to play the lead role of Indrajit and two ladies; Lakshmi Bai and Thripuramaba were selected to play the roles of Mandodari and Sulochana respectively.

Sachin Nayaka chose to shoot the film at Chatrapathi Studio in Kolhapur. The production was started in December 1933 and took 2 months to complete. Shooting was entirely done in natural sunlight and by man-made reflectors. The camera assistants carried mirrors on their shoulders to project light onto the set to provide back lighting. They had to keep moving mirrors in alignement with the moving sun. The sets were not having ceiling but they were covered with white cloth. Also, there was no glycerine at that time. Some water drops were sprayed near to the eyes of actress to pass them off as tears. The total amount spent for production was 40,000. The film involved shooting a war scene and this was done using 2 cameras. The film was released on 3 March 1934 at Paramount cinema theatre (later called as Parimala talkies) near the City Market of Bangalore. The length of the film was 173 minutes. Being the first Kannada talkie film, it ran house-full at Bangalore for six weeks.

Pathala Bhairavi

Pathala Bhairavi () is a 1951 Indian bilingual fantasy film written by Pingali Nagendrarao and directed by Kadiri Venkata Reddy. The film was produced by B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani under the banner Vijaya Vauhini Studios. It was co-written by Kamalakara Kameswara Rao and features N. T. Rama Rao, S. V. Ranga Rao and K. Malathi in the lead roles. The film focuses on a gardener's son who has to amass wealth equal to that of the king of Ujjain to marry his daughter, and a sorcerer who has to sacrifice an intelligent and brave young man to Goddess Pathala Bhairavi to gain access to a statuette which can grant any wish.

"Pathala Bhairavi" is based on "Kasi Majilee Kathalu", written by Madhira Subbanna Deekshitulu, though it was also partially inspired by the story of Aladdin. The entire production lasted for a whole year starting from 5 February 1950 until 8 February 1951, due to the film being shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil languages. Ghantasala composed the film's music and Marcus Bartley served as the cinematographer. The film was edited by the duo C. P. Jambulingam and M. S. Money, while Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were the film's art directors. The Telugu version was released on 15 March 1951, and the Tamil version on 17 May 1951.

Upon release, "Pathala Bhairavi" received critical acclaim and was commercially successful, becoming the first Telugu film to have a direct run of 200 days. It is considered to be a breakthrough film for both Rama Rao and Ranga Rao, and was also the only South Indian film to be screened at the first International Film Festival of India held at Mumbai on 24 January 1952. On the centenary of Indian cinema in April 2013, CNN-News18 included "Pathala Bhairavi" in its list of "100 greatest Indian films of all time".

The queen of Ujjain is keen for her daughter Indumathi (alias Indu) to marry her brother Surasena, a timid and mentally unstable person. When the gardener's son 'Thota' Ramudu beats Surasena at a concert for irritating the common people, he is summoned by the king to the court. His boldness leaves a considerable impression, but when Ramudu declares his love for Indu a day before his death sentence for meeting Indu secretly, the king is reminded of the astrologers' prediction that only a brave man can save her from a wicked sorcerer. He then challenges Ramudu to amass wealth equal to that of his to marry Indu, to which Ramudu agrees. He is released from prison.

Ramudu meets a Nepali sorcerer during the latter's magic show in a street. The sorcerer, who is ordered by Goddess Pathala Bhairavi during his prayers to sacrifice an intelligent and brave young man before her to be granted a statuette which grants any wish, feels that Ramudu is suitable for the sacrifice. While taking a holy bath in the nearby pond, Ramudu kills a crocodile that immediately transforms into a woman after being killed. The woman informs Ramudu that he had freed her from a hermit's curse and also reveals the sorcerer's intentions. Just before the sacrifice, Ramudu sacrifices the sorcerer and wins the statuette, consequently amassing the wealth equal to that of the king. In return, the king lives up to his promise and accepts Indu's wishes to marry Ramudu.

The sorcerer's apprentice Sadajapa discovers his master dead at Pathala Bhairavi's shrine and brings him back to life with the help of Sanjeevani. Upon resurrection, the sorcerer makes a deal with Surasena, who was about to commit suicide, to bring the statuette in exchange of everything Ramudu has, including Indu. Surasena agrees and steals the statuette, then handing it over to the sorcerer which changes the fate of Ramudu and Indu, leaving the former penniless. Ramudu pledges to bring Indu his wealth back and leaves for the sorcerer's lair along with his cousin, Anji.

While they are unable to locate the sorcerer's lair, Indu refuses the sorcerer's proposal to marry him. With the help of the statuette, the sorcerer brings Ramudu to his lair and tortures him in front of Indu with a hope that she would succumb to his proposal to marry him. Posing as Sadajapa, Anji requests the sorcerer to shave his beard to win Indu's heart. The sorcerer shaves his beard, losing his powers in the process. Afterwards, Ramudu finds the statuette and wishes to bring the palace back to Ujjain. In a fight between Ramudu and the sorcerer mid-way in the sky, the latter is killed by Ramudu. The palace is back in Ujjain and Surasena apologises to both Ramudu and Indu before uniting them. While Anji marries Indu's best friend, the film ends with the marriage of Ramudu and Indu.



After making their debut with "Shavukaru" (1950), B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani of Vijaya Vauhini Studios signed Kadiri Venkata Reddy later in the year to make a folklore film. The film, "Pathala Bhairavi", was based on a story from "Kasi Majilee Kathalu", written by Madhira Subbanna Deekshitulu. Pingali Nagendrarao adapted the content and wrote the film's story. Kamalakara Kameswara Rao and Venkata Reddy worked on the screenplay. Nagendrarao was also inspired from the story of Aladdin. "Pathala Bhairavi" was made as a bilingual film, shot in Telugu and Tamil simultaneously with both the versions having the same title. The Tamil version's dialogues were written by Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass.

T. Prakash Rao, who went on to make his directorial debut with "Palletooru" (1952), worked as an assistant director for the film. K. Viswanath also joined the film's crew as an assistant director, along with K. Raghava as the film's action choreographer. Marcus Bartley was recruited as the film's cinematographer and the duo C. P. Jambulingam and M. S. Money edited the film. Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were the film's art directors. Ghantasala composed the film's music.

Initially, Venkata Reddy had Akkineni Nageswara Rao in mind for the lead role. He later wanted to cast Raja Reddy in the lead role but replaced him with N. T. Rama Rao in the last minute, who made his debut by playing a minor character in "Mana Desam" (1949). Rama Rao was eventually signed as a part of his four-film contract with Vijaya Vauhini Studios after Venkata Reddy was impressed with Rama Rao when he met him on the sets of "Samsaram" (1950). With this film, Rama Rao became the first actor to have acted in two languages simultaneously.

Mukkamala was initially considered for the role of the sorcerer, the film's antagonist. But with Rama Rao being signed as the protagonist, Venkata Reddy wanted to cast an actor without an image, thus S. V. Ranga Rao was signed. Ranga Rao wore costumes reminiscent of a Shakespearean anti-hero and used the catchphrase "Sahasamsayara Dimbhaka" ("Be adventurous man"). He took inspiration from Shylock, the antagonist of Shakespeare's play, "The Merchant of Venice", which he played when he was a stage-artist. Muthudhuta Peethambaram, who joined Vijaya Vauhini Studios in 1945, helped Ranga Rao take on the appearance of a 105-year-old man with the use of make-up.

Malathi, who had earlier acted in Venkata Reddy's "Bhakta Potana" (1942), was signed to play the female lead role Indumathi, the princess of Ujjain. Girija played the titular role of goddess Pathala Bhairavi. Relangi Venkata Ramaiah and Balakrishna were signed to play supporting roles; the former playing the role of the brother-in-law of Indumathi's father played by C. S. R. Anjaneyulu and the latter playing Rama Rao's sidekick. Padmanabham was signed to play a supporting role as well. Savitri did a short dance sequence in the film.

"Pathala Bhairavi" was the first big budget film produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios. The entire production lasted for a whole year starting from 5 February 1950 until 8 February 1951, due to the film being shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil. Pasumarthi Krishnamurthy conducted the choreography for the song sequences. Major portions of the film were shot in large sets and many trick shots were used by Bartley during the process. Both versions were filmed using an Arri 11 CBR Camera.

For scenes in the film that featured the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit to make it look like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.

According to K. N. T. Sastry in his book "Alanati Chalana Chitram", the film begins with the theme of "Dhairye Sahase Lakshmi" (Bravery gives wealth) which is present throughout the film. While the characters of Rama Rao and Ranga Rao epitomise heroism, the character of the princess played by Malathi epitomises innocence and sensuality. "Pathala Bhairavi" sets up an opposition between the worship of Rama by the protagonist's mother and the worship of Pathala Bhairavi by the sorcerer; the former being a frequent one inhabited in a domestic space while the latter being an uncivilised one.

According to Azim Premji University liberal studies faculty member S. V. Srinivas, "Pathala Bhairavi" was a blend of folklore and social drama. Srinivas stated that the depiction of the goddess Pathala Bhairavi before Ramudu sacrifices the sorcerer was reminiscent of the representation of Poleramma worship by dalits in the film "Mala Pilla" (1938). He added that "Pathala Bhairavi" "ratifies certain social relationships by presenting them as natural and given" and "at the same time, some other practices are presented as inhuman and uncivilised".

The official soundtrack of "Pathala Bhairavi" was composed by Ghantasala, the lyrics of which were written by Pingali Nagendrarao and Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass for the Telugu and Tamil versions respectively. The sound mixing process was supervised by A. Krishnan and Siva Ram. It was processed by N. C. Sen Gupta and was orchestrated by A. Krishnamurthy. The songs were composed using Mohana, Bhimpalasi and Sindhu Bhairavi ragas, with "Prema Kosamai Valalo Padene" and "Kanugona Galano" notably being modulated on the same raga. The soundtrack was released on 1 December 1950. Also, a digitally remastered version was released and marketed by HMV in 2003; the album cover depicts a still image from the film featuring Rama Rao and Malathi.

Relangi Venkata Ramaiah sang the comedy song "Vinave Bala Naa Prema Gola" which was filmed on himself. A costly Hammond organ was specially imported for this film which was played by Master Venu. For the Hindi dubbed version, T. G. Kamala Devi sang the song "Sunloji Sardaro" ("Ithihasam Vinnaara" in Telugu) and Jikki sang the song "Bindiya Chamke" ("Vagaloi Vagalu" in Telugu). The latter became the first Telugu film singer to record a song for a Hindi film with this Hindi dubbed version of "Pathala Bhairavi".

The Telugu version of "Pathala Bhairavi" was released on 15 March 1951, and the Tamil version was released two months later on 17 May 1951. Both versions were commercially successful, with the Telugu version completing a theatrical run of 100 days. "Pathala Bhairavi" became the first Telugu film to run continuously for 175 days, and the first Telugu film to have a direct run of 200 days. It completed the 175th day of its theatrical run in a total of 13 theatres.

S. S. Vasan acquired the film's Hindi dubbing rights and reshot two song sequences – "Ithihasam Vinnara" and "Vagaloi Vagalu" in colour. The Hindi dubbed version was commercially successful. "Pathala Bhairavi" was the only South Indian film to be screened at the first International Film Festival of India held at Mumbai on 24 January 1952. Sahitya Surabhi organised a programme at the Visakha Public Library in Visakhapatnam on 7 March 2015 on the eve of the 64th anniversary of this film's release and writer Rambhatla Nrusimha Sastry attended the programme as the chief guest.

"Pathala Bhairavi" received critical acclaim. CNN-News18 stated that the film was full of "mysteries and twists", and "this Telugu film has a screenplay which is not only fast but is also able to engage the audiences", adding that the way Rama Rao managed to bring out the innocence of the character is a "lesson in acting". M. L. Narasimham of "The Hindu" stated that this film's story was made into a "grand spectacle by the genius that Kadiri Venkata Reddy was, with excellent technical support" adding that he "mesmerised the audience with a smooth narrative". He also praised the film's cinematography, sound designing and art direction.

In his book "Alanati Chalana Chitram", K. N. T. Sastry stated that Venkata Reddy deserves full credit for this film's excellence and praised the performances of Rama Rao, Malathi and Ranga Rao in particular. In July 2010, Hemanth Kumar of "South Scope" called "Pathala Bhairavi" a film that "took an entire generation by storm" and praised its special effects in particular, which Kumar felt were ahead of their time. In his book "One Hundred Indian Feature Films: An Annotated Filmography", Srivastava Banerjee gave a polarised review of the film by calling it "an extraordinarily meaningless modern myth".

In late November 2007, a Hyderabad-based company named Goldstone Technologies acquired the film negative rights of 14 Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including "Mayabazar" (1957) and "Pathala Bhairavi", to release their digitally re-mastered versions in colour. After the success of the digitised and colourised version of "Mayabazar" released in January 2010, its makers announced that "Pathala Bhairavi" would be the next film to be remastered and re-released in colour. However Goldstone Technologies decided not to remaster the remaining 14 films including "Pathala Bhairavi", saying that most of the producers who sold the rights of the negatives to TV channels lost control over them, adding that there were also a lot of legal issues over ownership and copyright issues whenever other producers try to do something on their own.

"Pathala Bhairavi" achieved cult status in Telugu cinema. The lines "Nijam Cheppamantara Abaddham Cheppamantara" ("Shall I say the truth? or shall I lie?"), "Sahasamsayara Dhimbaka" ("Be adventurous man!"), "Naruda Yemi Nee Korika" ("O Human, what you want?") became popular and phrases such as "dingari" ("servant") and "dimbhaka" ("fool") later became a part of Telugu vernacular. The film's story is regularly staged as a play by Surabhi theatre group, known as "Sri Venkateswara Natya Mandali".

During a programme "Telugu Cinema Prasthanam" organised by the film society of Vishakhapatnam, writer include actor Ravi Kondala Rao placed "Pathala Bhairavi" among other cult films like "Raja Harishchandra" (1913), "Bhakta Prahlada" (1932), "Mala Pilla", "Devadasu" (1953) and "Lava Kusa" (1963) during a speech on the role of Telugu cinema in the hundred years of Indian cinema. On the centenary of Indian cinema in April 2013, CNN-News18 included "Pathala Bhairavi" in its list, "The 100 greatest Indian films of all time".
The film is considered to be a breakthrough film for both Rama Rao and Ranga Rao. Rama Rao later starred in other folklore films like "Chandirani" (1953), "Rechukka" (1954) and "Jayasimha" (1955); all of which were commercially successful. When the film's unit was travelling by train to attend the 100th day celebrations of "Pathala Bhairavi" at Bellary, the then Union Home Minister C. Rajagopalachari was travelling in Madras Mail. When both the trains happened to halt at Guntakal, people who had come to greet Rajagopalachari rushed to the other platform to have a glimpse of the film's unit, which left Rajagopalachari amazed by the popularity that the film had attained.

"Pathala Bhairavi" inspired Vijaya Productions along with its collaborator Chandamama to produce "Bhairava Dweepam" (1994) directed by Singeetham Srinivasa Rao starring Rama Rao's son Nandamuri Balakrishna in the lead along with Roja. In the pre-climax sequences of the Telugu film "Okkadu" (2003), when Obul Reddy (played by Prakash Raj) is about to murder Ajay (played by Mahesh Babu), the latter compares the former with Ranga Rao's character in "Pathala Bhairavi" who was murdered by Rama Rao's character. The film's story was used as a play in the Telugu film "Krishnam Vande Jagadgurum" (2012), which was based on the Surabhi theatre group.

Alluri Seetarama Raju (film)

Alluri Seetarama Raju is a 1974 Indian Telugu-language biographical action film based on the life of Alluri Sitarama Raju, an Indian revolutionary who is known for his role in the Rampa Rebellion of 1922–24, and tribal leader Gam Malludora during the Indian independence movement in the Madras Presidency. Raju with a band of farmers, tribal leaders and other sympathizers fought an armed rebellion against the British Raj who violated their land rights and used them for forced labor. The film is produced by Padmalaya Studios, as the 100th film of Ghattamaneni Krishna. By its collections this film recorded as Industry Hit at the box-office.

Scripted by Maharadhi Tripuraneni, the film was directed by V. Ramachandra Rao, as South India's first Cinemascope film. The film won the National Film Award for Best Lyrics for revolutionary compositions rendered by Telugu Marxist poet and composer Srirangam Srinivasa Rao. The film won the Nandi Award for Best Feature Film, and was screened at the International Film Festival of India in the mainstream section, and "Tashkent Film Festival". The film was the highest grossing Telugu film for that year.

The film was screened retrospective on August 16, 2016 at the "Independence Day Film Festival" jointly presented by the Indian Directorate of Film Festivals and Ministry of Defense, commemorating 70th Indian Independence Day. This is despite the fact that many tribals opposed the appropriation and use of the film commemorating their hero by the Indian government, who they allege have been abusing farmers and tribals land rights as much as the British. 


Soundtrack was composed by P. Adinarayana Rao.

The movie was a blockbuster becoming the first Telugu movie to collect a share of 2 crore rupees.

The soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman. "Ponmagal Vandaal" is a remix of the song of the same name from "Sorgam" (1970).

"Sify" stated "The highlight here is that there are 2 Vijays - the good guy and the bad guy. Director Barathan has tried out a new format, where both the hero and the villain entertain the audiences with howlarious moments, that brings the house up. Vijay makes it work and believable as he melds an effortfully from casual song froid to utter seriousness. His terrific comic timing, his ability to mock and lampoon makes his performance absolutely hits a bulls eye. In the negative character Prasad’s role, he is the veritable scene stealer. He has dubbed impressively modulating his voice for both the characters, and the way he dances in the introductory title song is amazing. No two ways about it, Vijay is the heart and soul of ATM and rated 5/5. IndiaGlitz stated "Azhagiya Tamil Magan" banks heavily on Vijay's charm and performance, Vijay has lived up to the challenge created by the huge success of "Pokkiri". He looks stylish and handsome with his dual role. He lights up the screen by his dynamic performance. Director Bharathan has exploited Vijay's strengths in dual role as well. He has provided a perfect family entertainer and rated 5/5 as well.

The film stars Preity Zinta, Shiney Ahuja and Isha Koppikar in leading roles. Dharmendra appears in a supporting role as Zinta's father. The film relates the love story between two neighbours, played by Zinta and Ahuja, who are paired together on-screen for the first time.

Preity Zinta and Shiney Ahuja were Jahnu Barua's first choices for the leading roles. Initially, Dipannita Sharma was supposed to play the supporting role of Zinta's roommate, but was later replaced by Isha Koppikar. Amitabh Bachchan was also supposed to make a role in the film as Zinta's father, but he later opted out due to date problems. Bachchan was subsequently replaced by Dharmendra, after Zinta, who was looking for an opportunity to work with him, had suggested his name. Dino Morea makes a special appearance in a song composed by Pritam Chakraborty.

Filming began in August 2007 in Mumbai, and took place in Kolkata and Shillong, Meghalaya. The film's release was delayed for several years following rape charges which were brought on male lead Shiney Ahuja and which might have dampened the film's commercial prospects. In November 2010, it was announced that the film would come out in December of that year.
However, on 25 November 2014, Barua announced that the film's production had been halted with no plans to release the film.

Raksha's King Ravana decides to invade Amaravati, the capital of the heavenly kingdom of Indra. Scared of Ravana's plans, Indra asks Narada for help. Narada informs Indra that Ravana's strength comes from the worship performed by Kaikasi, Ravana's mother. He suggests that Indra sabotage Ravana's mother's worship of Saikatha Lingam, a sand sculpture representation of Lord Siva.

Ravana decides to perform penance and bring Lord Siva's Atma Lingam for his mother to worship. Hearing of Ravana's plans from Narada, Goddess Parvathi, Lord Siva's consort, appeals to Lord Vishnu. When Lord Siva appears to Ravana to grant his wish, Lord Vishnu manipulates Ravana's mind and makes him wish for Goddess Parvathi. As Ravana proceeds home with Goddess Parvathi, Narada meets him midway and tells him that his companion is a fake Parvathi. Dejected by the subterfuge, Ravana returns Goddess Parvathi to Lord Siva.

During his return journey, he meets Mandodari, the young princess of Pathala. Believing she is the real Goddess Parvathi, he marries her. Eventually, he realizes what happened and appeals to Lord Siva for forgiveness by presenting his severed head. Lord Siva presents Ravana with Atma Lingam and warns him that, if the Atma Lingam ever touches the earth, it can never be moved again. Narada instigates Lord Vinayaka to trick Ravana into grounding the Atma Lingam at what later became known as Gokarna Kshethram in Karnataka.

Agaram (film)

Agaram () is a 2007 Indian Tamil-language action film written and directed by T. Nagarajan. It stars Nandha and Archana in the lead roles, with Biju Menon portraying the role of the antagonist, and Vivek, Seetha and Raj Kapoor among others in supporting roles. Despite being announced shortly after Nandha's debut in 2002, the film's release was delayed and eventually released on 16 February 2007, failing at the box office.

Thiru (Nandha) is a young Airtel employee who has just moved into the family's new house in Tuticorin with his sister (Varshini), mother (Seetha), and grandmother (Sukumari). Their happiness is tinged with the grief of Thiru's father's (Agathiyan) recent death, before the construction could be completed. Fate decrees that the entire family be placed in jeopardy when Thiru has an argument with Pasupathy, the brother of the dreaded don of the waterfront mafia, Varma (Biju Menon), during the local elections. Varma swears to kill Thiru, agreeing to spare his life for just four days until the election ends, at the request of his politician crony (Ilavarasu), who is all set to become the MLA. The family flees but is captured and brought back to face the atrocities unleashed by Varma's goons.


The soundtrack and film score were composed by the noted composer Yuvan Shankar Raja. The soundtrack was released on 12 December 2005, nearly 14 months before the film's theatrical release. It has five tracks with lyrics written by Snehan.
Director Nagaraj in this action-thriller does justice to his work by retaining the momentum of the story. Nandha as the protagonist in the role of Thiru has managed his part well and proves himself versatile in both romantic and action scenes. The young actor, however, has to do much better in the time to come to make it big in the Tamil films.

Although, given scarcely any scene and a couple of duets, Hardeep Singh as the female lead, has done fairly well. Vivek fits well in the comedy part of the film. Biju Menon displays good histrionics as the villain. Agathiyan also proves to be a good actor appearing as Nandha's father. Yuvan Shankar Raja's music composition is fast-paced with catchy numbers. Cinematographer Vetrivel has excelled in his camera work.

Innale

Innale () is a 1990 Malayalam psychological film, written and directed by P. Padmarajan with Shobhana,
Jayaram, Suresh Gopi and Srividya in pivotal roles. Director Ranjith recognises it as one of his favourite films.

A girl (Shobhana), is found as an injured victim of a bus accident, during her travel to religious places throughout India. She is taken to a hospital in a hill station, where the doctor declares that she has amnesia due to the accident, and has forgotten herself and her past.

She forgets her larger past and starts to move with courage, towards her new-found self, after struggling within herself, asking questions. She also meets malicious people who claim to be her well-wishers, taking advantage of her vulnerability. She fights them with the help of the brave Mr. Sharath Menon (Jayaram), who protects her during the transition to become the new Maya (a new name christened by Sharath).

Dr. Sandhya (Srividya) who treated her, is also Sharath's mother. She too comforts her and allows her to become Maya. Though she does worry about what is to follow. Sandhya decides to meet anyone who claim to be Maya's family, so that she could help her out. Sharath brings actors to make Dr. Sandhya believe that Maya has parents, to get his mother's consent to marry Maya, with whom he has deeply fallen in love with. Sandhya has no other choice than to leave the young lovers to their own fate.

Meanwhile, Dr. Narendran (Suresh Gopi), who is a scientist by profession working in the US, starts to search for his lost wife, Gauri. After much searching with all his friends and resources, he finally gets information about a girl who was an accident victim on a hill station. He calls Sandhya during her birthday party, where the doctor also announces the engagement of Maya with her son, Sharath. Sandhya is shocked and informs her son about Dr. Narendran's phone call. Narendran reminiscences memories of the beautiful days spent with his lovely wife Gauri.

The three main characters meet where Narendran becomes speechless after his wife talks to him like a complete stranger. He decides that she has indeed become a new person and it would be unfair to bring her more sorrow by revealing the truth that she is his wife.
Sharath happily asks whether she was the person he is looking for, to which Narendran answers no, by only shaking his head. He understands that Sharath and Maya are deeply in love with each other and leaves in haste, never showing Sarath his wedding photos with Gauri, that he was carrying with him. The last scene shows the bewildered Maya and Sharath staring at him, leaving so abruptly, without drinking the tea she made.

The movie revolves around a rich city boy (played by Khanna), who aspires to be a musician against his father's wishes and assumes a different identity to sing for a radio station, while his songs are written by a poor friend (played by Mehra)
Pyarelal quoted in an interview "Rajesh Khanna had great interest in music and a terrific sense of melody too. His music is dominated by Pancham (R.D. Burman) and us and we accepted Shakti Samanta's Anurodh only because Rajesh Khanna had had some misunderstanding with Pancham then and did not want to work with him." Director Shakti Samanta said that although the film had an "interesting story", he felt that audiences didn't want to accept the leading man, Rajesh Khanna, doing romantic scenes with his real-life wife Dimple Kapadia's sister Simple Kapadia and this is the reason this film was just a superhit otherwise it would have been a bigger blockbuster.

Arun (Rajesh Khanna) was the only son of a rich businessman Mr. Chaudhury. He was an upcoming singer, sings in local radio, mostly the songs written by his friend Srikant (Vinod Mehra). His father wants him to look after their family business and thinks singing is not the kind of job for people of their status. This always leads to friction between father and son. On the other end, Srikant leads a very poor lifestyle along with his widowed mother. He earns a living by writing songs and articles. Arun frequently helps them with money as Srikant becomes chronically ill and couldn't work outside.

While things are like this, one day Arun fights with his father and decides to leave his house for Calcutta (presently Kolkata). He joins as a singer there in local radio and works as a driver in the house of Mr. Mathur (Ashok Kumar). He uses name Sanjay Kumar to hide his identity. Mathur lives along with his grandchild Sunita (Simple Kapadia). He lost his son in a war and can't find the whereabouts of his daughter-in-law and grandson for which he continuously organizes searches. Arun grows close with Sunita, headstrong granddaughter of Mathur. Sunita admires Sanjay Kumar without knowing that he and Arun are one and the same. Mathur comes to know that Arun was the escaped son of his friend Chaudhury and informs him regarding Arun's whereabouts.

Meanwhile, Srikant becomes critically ill and doctors diagnose it as end stage tuberculosis. His mother comes to Calcutta along with him. Arun gets shocked to see Srikant like that and swears to save him anyway. He decides to organize a stage show though he decides not to do it till the last minute. He sings on a stage and earns enough money for the operation. The surgeon recognizes Srikant's mother as the lost daughter-in-law of Mathur and informs him. Srikant's operation becomes a success and he gets reunited with his grandfather. Arun's parents come to Calcutta to see how their son became famous and his father changes his opinions regarding singing. At the end, everyone reconciles and Sunita and Arun marry.

This film seems to be very heavily inspired by the Cary Grant/Audrey Hepburn super hit film CHARADE.

The cinematographer in this film, Nariman Irani, while working on this film decided to borrow most of the plot of "Chhailla Babu" and shared a modified story idea to Chandra Barot, who made the new modified story as the film "Don" (1978).

A suspense thriller, "Chhaila Babu" was the yesteryear actor Joy Mukherjee's second and only successful film as a director.

Rita, played by Zeenat, is vacationing in the snowy mountains in Kashmir. Rita is a ski champion. A warning sign on the slopes is chopped down by an unseen person, and Rita skis blithely on into danger. She's rescued by a local ski guide, who shows up again minutes later as a carriage driver. When she asks him who he really is, he responds with a song: "Main Chhaila Babu".

Chhaila Babu had first posed as a skiing lifeguard and then as a tangewala. Meanwhile, in Bombay, Rita's gangster dad is murdered while trying to run away with a suitcase that has cash worth Rs 80 lakhs. A policeman curiously reaches the murder scene, and the dying dad murmurs a number into his ear - 77203. With no sign of the suitcase and suspecting the dreaded "Scorpion" to be behind the crime, the police call Rita to Mumbai.

When he drops her off at her hostel, a CBI Inspector (Om Shivpuri) is waiting for her. He tells her about her father's murder and asks her about the money. She's distraught but knows nothing, and he asks her to return to Bombay to help the CBI in their investigation. At the airport observing her arrival are the gang and—Chhaila Babu, wearing a medal around his neck. Mac Mohan attacks Rita at her home and suddenly Chhaila Babu steps in to save her. Macmohan sees his Scorpion medal, and both men flee. Chhaila Babu tenderly administers to Rita's wounds and kisses her. He tells her that he loves her and wants to marry her, and if she hands over the robbery money he'll take it to the police for her—otherwise he's afraid she'll be killed for it. Rita sees a diamond necklace hanging out of one of his pockets, and tells him furiously to get out. He tells her that society has made him a thief; that it robbed him of his family and left him with nothing to live for except vengeance, but she's unsympathetic.
Rita finds Chhaila in Mumbai again, this time as a taxi driver. He tells her that her words the night before have changed him. He tells her about his past. Meanwhile, the police and the CBI Inspector are pretty sure that Chhaila Babu is Scorpion, but they need evidence. He takes her to a nightclub and there he starts flirting with Lily. The club happens to belong to Ranjit, and Mac Mohan is there too; he recognizes Chhaila Babu as Scorpion. As he tells Ranjit who Chhaila Babu really is?

But she is soon told that the man with many disguises could be the Scorpion, who could be her dad's killer. A furious Rita now gets determined to kill Chhailla, but the rest of the story is all about who Chhailla Babu is, why he is behind the girl, and how he was in Kashmir when Rita had been there too. 
Does he really love Rita or is he just using her? And where is the 80 lakhs rupees from the Southern Bank robbery?

It had collections of 4,00,00,000 in 1977 and became a superhit. It received four stars in the Bollywood guide "Collections".

Mashaal () is a 1984 Bollywood film. Produced and directed by Yash Chopra, it starred Dilip Kumar, Anil Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Rati Agnihotri, Nilu Phule, Iftekhar, Saeed Jaffery, Gulshan Grover, Alok Nath, Madan Puri and Amrish Puri. The role played by Anil Kapoor was first offered to Amitabh Bachchan and then to Kamal Haasan, but after they declined the offer, the role went to Anil Kapoor. Vinod Kumar (Dilip Kumar) plays a respected, law-abiding citizen who turns to crime for exacting revenge. The movie was based on the well-known Marathi play "Ashroonchi Zhali Phule" written by famous Marathi writer Vasant Kanetkar.

Vinod Kumar (Dilip Kumar) is an upright and honest man, who runs a newspaper named "Mashaal". Vinod exposes the ills in the society with help of his newspaper. Vinod's wife, Sudha (Waheeda Rehman), sees a vagabond named Raja (Anil Kapoor) and tries to instill some values and culture in him. Vinod is sceptical about this, but accepts when Raja tells them of his tragic childhood and comes to regard Sudha as a maternal figure. Finally, Vinod decides to help Raja by sending him to Bangalore to complete his education and become a journalist. During frequent meetings with Vinod and Sudha, Raja befriends Geeta (Rati Agnihotri), an aspiring journalist and an assistant in Vinod's paper, and they fall in love.

During his investigations, Vinod finds that S.K. Vardhan (Amrish Puri), a wealthy and respected man in the society, is behind many malpractices. Vinod starts exposing S.K's illicit business of drug-trafficking and selling hooch. Initially, S.K. tries to buy Vinod's silence by bribing him, but when Vinod decides to stand up to S.K., the latter inflicts misery on Vinod by having him thrown out of his rented house via the landlord. That very night, Vinod's newspaper office is burnt down by S.K.'s men. Helpless, and on the streets, tragedy strikes Vinod and Sudha further when Sudha, who is ailing, dies on the road, leaving Vinod distraught and heartbroken.

A disillusioned Vinod realizes that S.K. will always trump him, since people also support him. Instead of trying to expose S.K., Vinod now decides to follow S.K's footsteps in order to destroy him. Vinod, in association with Kishorilal (Saeed Jaffrey), starts producing illicit hooch and doing other illegal businesses to earn lots of money – the thing, Vinod retrospectively feels, he lacked, and the shortage of which led to the tragedies in his life. In a very short time, Vinod becomes a very rich man. All this time, Raja, who is in Bangalore for his studies, is blissfully unaware of these developments. The only other person exposed to this truth is Geeta, who has grown resentful of Vinod and has started working in another newspaper.

Vinod's business now stands as a threat to Vardhan's empire. Soon, Raja returns after completing his education and meets Vinod and is surprised to see that the latter's lifestyle has changed, but doesn't know the truth.

Raja meets Munna (Gulshan Grover), an old friend, from whom he learns that a new crime lord has entered the fray and has gained a foothold in the hooch and drugs world. Raja decides to expose this criminal, who, unbeknownst to him, is Vinod himself. Vinod is disturbed to learn that Raja is trying to dismantle his empire, but does not stop him. Raja starts working for Dinesh (Alok Nath), another journalist for whom Geeta also works. A chance discussion between Raja, Dinesh and Geeta leads to the revelation that Vinod is, indeed, the new drug boss. Raja is flummoxed upon learning this, and goes to meet Vinod to confront him about this. Vinod accepts the truth, and tells him what happened. After an emotional upheaval and deep pondering, Raja decides that he will continue on the righteous path Vinod taught him, even if this means exposing the very person, who treated him as his own son, as a criminal. Vinod feels humbled when Raja tells him that he still views Vinod as his mentor, upon which Vinod gives him his blessings to continue his chosen work.

Meanwhile, Vinod and S.K's enmity reaches a head when Raja starts writing about both. Finally, S.K kidnaps Raja and threatens him. Vinod enters and saves Raja, before fighting with S.K. Vinod kills S.K by throwing him in printing press wheels. Keshav, a henchman of S.K, tries to shoot Raja, but Vinod comes in between and gets fatally shot.

Dr. Satyajit Chavan is the head doctor at a civil hospital in Delhi. Satyajit is well regarded and respected, but he has terrible bedside manners and is generally rude to everyone. His staff of doctors, most of whom are young interns fresh out of medical school, inquire about his bedside manner. He curtly informs them that his job is to treat patients and that beds must be allocated to the ones who are most likely to survive and get better. We discover that government hospitals (especially in large cities like Mumbai) are severely limited in bed space and attract the worst stricken patients in the city. These draconian conditions have shaped Satyajit and his views on treatment.

Love Story 2050

Love Story 2050 is a 2008 Indian science fiction-romance film starring producer Pammi Baweja and director Harry Baweja's son Harman Baweja and Priyanka Chopra. Some parts were filmed in Adelaide, Australia. Initially the film was supposed to release on 21 December 2007 but got postponed to 4 July 2008 due to extensive post-production work. The premiere was held on 2 July 2008 in London. The film draws a lot of similarity to the 1991 Telugu film "Aditya 369"; while the Telugu film dealt with travel to the past as well as dystopian post-apocalyptic future, "Love Story 2050" was exclusively about travelling to a utopian future-city of Mumbai in the year 2050. It is the first utopian time travel film of Bollywood. The movie was released on 4 July 2008 and performed poorly at the box office.

Karan Malhotra is a spirited and happy-go-lucky boy who does not follow the rules. Sana is the opposite of Karan: a sweet and shy girl who lives life by the rules. Even though they are completely opposite, they fall in love, leading to a magical love story.

A scientist, Dr. Yatinder Khanna, has dedicated 15 years of his life to building a time machine. Sana expresses a wish to time-travel to Mumbai in the year 2050, but she is killed in an accident before her marriage to Karan. Karan wishes to travel back in time and find Sana. Dr. Yatinder, Karan, and Sana's siblings, Rahul and Thea, travel forward in time and reach Mumbai in 2050. They are fascinated by the futuristic Mumbai, with its flying cars, holograms, robots, 200-story buildings and more.

Twists and turns lead to the introduction of Ziesha, the reincarnation of Sana. Ziesha is a popular singer in 2050 who does not remember her past life, but gets flashbacks of it after meeting Karan. Unlike Sana, Ziesha is an arrogant, headstrong and rebellious girl who does not believe in love. She leads a lonely life after the death of her parents, which has embittered her.

Karan and the others find themselves under the threat of the demi-god, Dr. Hoshi. After Karan tells Ziesha he loves her, he is taken away from her by the guards. Ziesha does not believe him when he tells her about his time travel. However, after reading Sana's diary, Ziesha ultimately remembers her past life. Karan returns to her and she declares her love for him and tells him she is Sana. Dr. Hoshi tries to capture Karan because he wants the time machine. After a wild attempt to catch Karan and Ziesha, Hoshi crashes into a nuclear substance truck and dies. Karan goes back to 2008 in the time machine with Ziesha and the rest of his family. Everyone is overjoyed to see their beloved Sana again and Karan proposes to her.


Initially, when "Love Story 2050" was announced in 2004, Kareena Kapoor had signed on to play Priyanka's role, for which she was reportedly paid Rs.30 million. Kapoor later opted out in 2006 saying she had some date problems and was replaced by Chopra. "Love Story" is Bollywood's first futuristic film and had 1200 special effect shots The budget – Rs.600 million – was high for an Indian movie that time.

The special effects were executed by four international firms. Two special effects houses — Weta Workshop (New Zealand) and John Cox (Brisbane, Australia) — have won an Academy Award for their work on international projects.

Along with lead actors, Harman and Priyanka, a robot was seen playing a major role; viewers also get to see a teddy bear which appears to be more than a toy.

Lead actress Priyanka Chopra played a double role so she coloured her hair twice: once red to portray the girl from future and then again black. The red-haired look is inspired from Harman Baweja's sister Rowena Baweja's painting which portrays woman of today and tomorrow. The script of "Love Story 2050" inspired her to do the painting.

The first trailer of the film was shown on 21 March 2008 at the premiere of "Race".

The film released on 4 July 2008 with 540 plus prints (including 200 digital screens) and approximately 200 prints overseas.

Taran Adarsh of Indiatimes called Harman the new flavour of the season and someone who will have a long stay in Bollywood..

Raja Sen of Rediff.com called the movie "absolutely ridiculous" with "nothing to offer". In reference to Harman Baweja, Sen said "He cannot act. He does not look good. He does not have screen presence".

It was a critical failure with many adding it on their worst movies lists as well as Priyanka and Harman's "worst film" lists.

Professor Shiju Sam Varughese, Coordinator of the Centre for Studies in Science, Technology and Innovation Policy at the Central University of Gujarat, did offer that the film's utopian version of Mumbai helps "understand the cultural anxieties about India’s neoliberal future".

The film failed to generate a big initial response and the bookings for the sci-fi release were tepid at best, garnering only about 25%–30% advance bookings.

"Love Story 2050" opened to a 25% response and, by noon shows, was in the 35%–40% range. In multiplexes, it opened to a 50%–60% response on Friday. The film was released on 725 cinemas including 350 digital cinemas.

The film crashed all around in week two, thus an average in India and overseas. Most call it a trade disaster because it could not retrieve the cost of its budget, making Adlabs lose over .

Harry Baweja has plans to release the movie on DVD and has sold the DVD rights for a huge price. The DVD pack will include videos on the making of "Love Story 2050" and its special effects.

Rocking Pixels in co-ordination with undisclosed USA-based firms is developing a game based on the film. The game was to be released sometime in June at an expected price point of around Rs200; after the movie's failure, the release date of the game has been extended. This concept follows other Bollywood-based video games such as Dhoom 2 and Ghajini..

The music is composed by Anu Malik. The lyrics are by Javed Akhtar.While the movie sank, the song "Milo Na Milo" was a monster hit among the young generation of India.

Final Solution (2003 film)

Final Solution is a 2004 documentary film directed by Rakesh Sharma concerning the 2002 Gujarat riots in which both Hindu and Muslims were targeted in the state of Gujarat by political extremists. In order to rationalize their violence, Hindu extremists had made the claim that their actions were in fact a "spontaneous response" to the Godhra Train Burning incident on 27 February 2002. But as the film proceeds with victims continuing to come forward and share their experiences, a more unsettling possibility seems to emerge- that far from being a spontaneous expression of outrage, the anti-Muslim violence had been carefully coordinated and planned.

An official estimate states that 254 Hindus and 790 Muslims were killed during the riots, with 223 more missing. 

The documentary consists mostly of interviews, with both Muslims and Hindus, of multiple generations, and both sexes, with different views regarding the causes, justifications and the actual events of the violence that occurred, as well as their prospects for the future.

Part 1: Pride and Genocide deals with the carnage and its immediate aftermath. It examines the patterns of pre-planned genocidal violence (by right-wing Hindutva cadres), which many claim was state-supported, if not state-sponsored. The film reconstructs through eyewitness accounts the attack on Gulbarg and Patiya (Ahmedabad) and acts of barbaric violence against Muslim women at Eral and Delol/Kalol (Panchmahals) even as Chief Minister Modi traverses the state on his Gaurav Yatra

Part 2 : The Hate Mandate documents the poll campaign during the Assembly elections in Gujarat in late 2002. It records in detail the exploitation of the Godhra incident by the right-wing propaganda machinery for electoral gains. The film studies and documents the situation months after the elections to find shocking faultlines – voluntary ghettoisation, segregation in schools, formal calls for economic boycott of Muslims and continuing acts of violence.

The movie was initially banned in India in 2004 for alleged fears that massive communalism and radicalism would be ignited by the film. The Censor Board's ruling itself was a violation of the Indian Supreme Court rulings on this specific issue.

Final Solution was banned in India by the Censor Board for several months. The ban was lifted in Oct.'04 after a sustained campaign (an online petition, hundreds of protest screenings countrywide, multi-city signature campaigns and dozens of letters to the Government sent by audiences directly).

A Pirate-and-Circulate campaign was conducted in protest against the ban (Get-a-free-copy-only-if-you-promise-to-pirate-and-make-5-copies). Over 10,000 free Video CDs of the film were distributed in India during this campaign, which ended in Dec. 2004. Final Solution was offered free to Anhad for their campaigns; it was included in their anthology titled "In defence of our dreams". Subscribers of several journals/mags also got a copy of the film free of cost. These included Communalism Combat (Ed : Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand), Samayik Varta (Ed : Yogendra Yadav), Janmat and several smaller journals.

Final Solution was rejected by the government-run Mumbai International Film Festival, but was screened at 'Vikalp: Films for Freedom', organised by the Campaign Against Censorship. Rakesh Sharma has been an active member of the Campaign since its inception.

A pilot movement to copy-and-redistribute the movie was held, briefly to protest the censoring of
the movie screenings. The film has been screened on BBC, NHK, DR2, YLE and several other channels. It is yet to be shown on Indian television.

Awarapan

Awarapan () is a 2007 Indian Hindi-language action thriller film directed by Mohit Suri and produced by Mukesh Bhatt under the banner of Vishesh Films. The film stars Emraan Hashmi, Shriya Saran, Mrinalini Sharma, and Ashutosh Rana in the lead roles, while Shaad Randhawa, Rehan Khan, Ashish Vidyarthi, Salil Acharya, and Purab Kohli play supporting roles. "Awarapan" released in India and worldwide on 29 June 2007. The film received positive reviews to widespread critical acclaim, however the film was a moderate success at the box office. This film’s success was mostly credited to its immensely popular music score. It became a cult classic and has been hailed as Hashmi's best performance. Many people consider it to be the best film of Emraan and Mohit Suri's career. The film is an uncredited remake of the South Korean film "A Bittersweet Life".

The story begins with Shivam (Emraan Hashmi), a heartbroken and introvert atheist, gangster, and right-hand man of Bharat Malik (Ashutosh Rana), officially a businessman who runs a chain of hotels in Hong Kong. Shivam is given the responsibility of one of these hotels, which he bears capably and well, making it much more successful than Malik's other hotels. Malik holds Shivam in the highest esteem due to Shivam's loyalty, reliability, and business acumen, and treats him like an adored son whom he entrusts with almost everything - indeed, more so than his biological son Ronnie (Salil Acharya). This is the cause of much jealousy on Ronnie's part against Shivam, but due to Malik's outspoken support for Shivam, Ronnie does not dare do openly oppose him. Shivam has a very close childhood friend, Kabir (Shaad Randhawa), who assists him with everything. Meanwhile, Malik's brother, Rajan (Ashish Vidyarthi), and Rajan's spoilt son Munna (Purab Kohli) nurture a grudge against Shivam because of Shivam's repeated conflicts with Munna.

One day, Malik asks Shivam to keep an eye on his young mistress Reema (Mrinalini Sharma), whom he suspects of having an affair with someone else, while he is away on a brief business trip. Reema is a young Pakistani girl, devout Muslim, and victim of sex trafficking, whom Malik had "bought" in the Bangkok flesh market. If Reema is found cheating on Malik, then Shivam has to inform him immediately.

In Shivam's interactions with Reema, he recalls his lost love, Aliyah (Shriya Saran) in a series of flashbacks. Aliyah was a devout Muslim whom Shivam had met by chance in the marketplace one day. The duo eventually fell in love, but when her father saw them together, he wrathfully confronted them, reprimanding Aliyah physically . He also exposed Shivam's gangster background to a shocked Aliyah, leading to Shivam's instantly offering her father his gun, saying that he was willing to let go of everything, start anew, and legitimately provide for Aliyah if he is allowed to be with her. Aliyah's father recovers from his initial surprise quickly and shoots at Shivam with the gun, who ducks to avoid the bullet. The bullet hits Aliyah instead, killing her and temporarily driving Shivam over the edge. A feeling of guilt and sorrow at Aliyah having died because he tried to save his own life remains with Shivam hereafter. Aliyah's father instantly commits suicide when he realizes what he has done.

Shivam discovers one night that Reema has a secret boyfriend named Bilal (Rehan Khan), who convinces her to run away with him back to Pakistan. Shivam informs Malik, who orders Reema's elimination. However, when he confronts the couple to eliminate them, she dares him to shoot her, claiming that freedom is her right, requesting mercy "for God's sake". Shivam is reminded of Aliyah's religious mannerisms, which bear a strong resemblance to Reema's, and is unable to shoot her, leaving her alive. Malik tries to reach Shivam, who severs contact with the former, leading to Malik finding out about his disobedience.

Shivam plans to quickly run away from Hong Kong back to India with Kabir, who is extremely unwilling to do so. Eventually, he betrays Shivam to Malik, whose regard for Kabir goes up. Malik has Shivam captured, and orders Ronnie to torture Shivam until he agrees to kill Reema when Shivam refuses to do so even after Malik offers him a second chance. Malik is shown to be genuinely hurt and sorrowful at what he perceives as Shivam's betrayal, and he hands over Shivam's responsibilities in the business to Kabir. Malik makes up the old feud with Rajan and Munna, and merges their gangs and businesses, with Malik demanding that Shivam be brought before him alive so that Malik can kill him personally. This occurs in Kabir's presence, who is bitterly penitent to the point of not wishing to live any more over his betrayal of Shivam.

Shivam manages to escape Ronnie and seeks refuge in the monastery of a monk whom he had once set free from certain death. He recovers from his injuries, and reminded of Aliyah and her belief in freedom, decides to not continue running all his life to save his own skin, but to "fulfill someone else's dreams" - namely, unite Bilal and Reema and send them to Pakistan. He manages to save Bilal from Malik's henchmen, led by Kabir, whom Shivam still trusts and regards as his best friend, who tearfully reiterates that he is ready to die for Shivam, as he always was. Kabir takes Bilal to the monastery, where arrangements are made to ship Bilal and Reema to Lahore.

Shivam tracks Reema, killing Rajan when he taunts Reema and refuses to divulge where she is. He tricks Munna into revealing Malik's plans regarding Reema, which are to sell her to the person who "enjoys" her the most. Munna tells Shivam everything about it including the location, believing him to be crippled by his wounds and is immediately killed by Shivam upon realizing that is not the case. Shivam finds Reema and Malik, who is madly enraged at Shivam's standing against him, when he had cared for Shivam so much, deriding Shivam's new belief in God and freedom. Shivam kills Malik and escapes with Reema to the shipping docks, where Bilal is waiting. Kabir shows up to fight Malik's men and buy Shivam time, and he is brutally murdered in the process. Bilal manages to force a reluctant Reema to escape to the ship, who is hesitant to leave Shivam behind. Ronnie and his men arrive and Shivam manages to kill them all in a gunfight, but he is mortally wounded himself. As Shivam lies dying, he comes to terms with his past, forgiving himself and envisioning Aliyah smiling down upon him. The movie ends with Reema in a conference in Pakistan, where she tells her story of the "awara" who sacrificed his life to save her, and incites those present to stand up for victims of trafficking.

The Train: Some Lines Should Never Be Crossed... is a 2007 Bollywood thriller film directed by Hasnain Hyderabadwala and Raksha Mistry. The film stars Emraan Hashmi, Geeta Basra and debutant Sayali Bhagat in the lead roles, and tells the story of a married couple caught up in a complex emotional tangle revolving around an extramarital affair. It is a remake of 2005 American film "Derailed".

Vishal Dixit (Emraan Hashmi), is a regular middle class man, settled in Bangkok with his wife, Anjali Dixit (Sayali Bhagat) and their 5-year-old daughter, Nikki, who is suffering from kidney failure and is in need of an operation. Anjali and Vishal are trying to hold on to their deteriorating marriage which is already under tremendous pressure due to their daughter’s illness. 

One ordinary day, on his way to work, Vishal meets Roma Kapoor (Geeta Basra), a beautiful, captivating woman. The attraction between them is instantaneous. Vishal gets to know her better and the two show each other photographs of their respective daughters and begin to talk. A mutual attraction develops. Vishal realizes that she too is a loner, trapped in a loveless marriage and the two begin meeting frequently. Ultimately, they decide to consummate their affair and end up in a hotel.

However, an armed man named Tony (Aseem Merchant) bursts into the hotel room, and robs them. Despite Vishal's pleads to both be left, Tony insteads inspects both their wallets and find out that they are having an affair. Tony takes advantage and tries to make a move on Roma. Vishal tried to stop Tony, but Tony beats Vishal unconscious, and rapes Roma. Vishal and Roma agree not to report the crime, as they do not want their spouses to learn of the affair. Shortly after, Vishal is blackmailed by Tony, who threatens to reveal the truth to his family if he does not pay him, which Vishal promptly does. A month later, Tony calls again, this time demanding 1 lakh. Vishal refuses him outright however Tony is then shown to have entered Vishal house by befriending Vishal’s wife and daughter and out of earshot repeats his demand or he will expose the truth to them.

Vishal and Roma go back to the hotel and removes the paperwork from the desk as evidence that they had an affair. However Tony finds out and threatens to expose pictures of them to the entire public if he is does not pay 5 lakh. Vishal explains his situation to Charlie (Suresh Menon), an ex-con who works as a cameraman in his advertising team and a close family friend whom Vishal had earlier befriended. Charlie offers to scare off Tony for a percent of the payout and Vishal agrees. He and Charlie travel to the meeting location specified by Tony, intending to catch him by surprise. However, before they can act, Charlie is shot and killed. Tony appears and takes the money, leaving Vishal to dispose of the body. Afterwards, Vishal is questioned by officer Asif Ahmed Khan (Rajat Bedi) about Charlie’s murder. Later, Vishal receives a call from Tony who has Roma hostage and threatens to kill her and Vishal's family if he does not pay him on time. This time the ransom is increased as high as 10 lakh, which is all the money put aside for Nikki's medical treatment. Vishal gives all this off as Tony leaves him completely broke. Later on the family doctor phones to inform him they have found a donor match for Nikki and can do the operation, but a defeated Vishal rues that he can’t pay for his daughter operation.

The next day, Vishal confesses the truth to a devastated Anjali, stops by Roma's company to see her. However he is introduced to the real Roma Kapoor. The woman he met on the train is identified as Richa Malhotra, a temp who had worked there briefly. He goes to Roma's apartment, which he realizes is actually in the process of being rented out. Seeing that Roma's photograph of her daughter was actually a cut out of a stock picture in a brochure, Vishal realizes Roma was in on the scam. 

He tracks her down and sees her kissing Tony, who, it turns out, is her boyfriend. Determined to retrieve his stolen money, he follows Richa's moves and sees that she is seducing another unsuspecting businessman. He rents a room in the same hotel where Richa, Tony, and their partner set him up and awaits them as they prepare to attack their new target. Richa and the businessman go to the room, but Vishal knocks Tony unconscious before he can follow them. Vishal breaks in and demands the return of his money. 

A gunfight ensues, and everyone is shot but Vishal, and a dying Richa reveals his money is in the hotel safe and then dies. Vishal, while in his rented room, is cleared by the police near the crime scene. As he leaves the hotel lobby, the continued investigation has all contents from the hotel safe laid out on the front desk. Vishal politely approaches the police and identifies his briefcase, which still contains his money, and quietly leaves the hotel. Vishal returns to his family, Nikki operation is successful and Anjali reconciles with him.
