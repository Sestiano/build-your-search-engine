Stuart Mason

Stuart Mason (2 June 1948 – 5 February 2006) was an English professional footballer who made appearances in The Football League for five clubs. The vast majority of his time was spent with Chester and Wrexham, mainly from full–back.

Mason was born in Whitchurch, Shropshire and began his playing days as a youngster with Shropshire-based non-league side Whitchurch Alport, which led to him joining Wrexham as a 16-year-old in November 1964. He made his first-team debut in January 1966 and was selected for England Youth three times in the following months. In October 1966 he completed a memorable year when he moved to Liverpool.

Mason was unable to break into the first-team squad at Anfield and after a brief loan spell at Doncaster Rovers he rejoined Wrexham in June 1968. He was largely a regular over the next five years, playing in the Division Four promotion winning side in 1969–70 and appearing in European Cup Winners Cup action after Wrexham lifted the Welsh Cup in 1972.

In 1973 Mason made the short journey across the border to Chester for £2,000, where he was again initially a regular player. His most memorable contributions came in the club's glorious 1974–75 season, when they defied all expectations to face Aston Villa in the Football League Cup semi–finals. Trailing 4–2 on aggregate in the second leg, Mason scored a stunning goal to give Chester hope in a tie they eventually lost 5–4. Later in the season he scored the winner on the final day of the season at Crewe Alexandra that ultimately secured promotion from Division Four for Chester and ensured he would forever hold hero status with supporters. Two years later Mason scored in Chester's 4–1 second leg win over Port Vale to help the club win the Debenhams Cup, their first national English trophy.

Mason's son, Simon, currently plays for Wrexham Supporters club. Operating as a central midfielder

Mason played his last game for Chester in a 1–1 draw with Plymouth Argyle on 8 October 1977. The same month saw him play his final Football League matches out on loan at Crewe Alexandra (having spent time with Rochdale the previous year). In December 1977 Mason moved to Bangor City, where he was to have a spell as manager. Mason was later at Rhyl, Oswestry Town and Coedpoeth and continued to play for veterans teams.

A former captain of Shropshire County Cricket Club, Mason ran his own sports shop in Wrexham and had a spell back with the Welsh side as assistant commercial manager.
In later years he was involved in coaching Chester's youngsters.

Joe Hoare

Joseph Henry "Joe" Hoare (November 1881 – 24 March 1947) was an English professional footballer who played as a full-back for Southampton and Liverpool in the 1900s.

Hoare was born in Southampton and trained as a carpenter and joiner, playing amateur football with Southampton Oxford F.C. He joined Southern League champions Southampton F.C. in 1902 and became understudy to England international George Molyneux. He made his debut on 25 October 1902 in a 2–0 victory over Luton Town but only made three further appearances during the 1902–03 season, at the end of which the "Saints" re-claimed the Southern League championship for the fifth time in seven years. Although he was considered to be "handicapped by a lack of weight, (he) more than compensated for this with his pluck and endurance". At the end of the season he received offers from Reading and Liverpool and chose the latter.

He made seven league appearances for Liverpool during the 1903–04 season, his debut coming on 24 October 1903 at home to Derby Co. with his final match coming against Sheffield United also at home on 12 March 1904.

After losing his place in the Liverpool side following an accident, he decided to return to the south coast, in time for Southampton's summer tour of South America, during which they played teams representing Argentina and Uruguay, winning 8–0 and 8–1 respectively. He went on to make three further league appearances for Southampton at the start of the 1904–05 season, before giving way to new signing, Bob Benson.

He decided to retire from professional football before the end of the season and became the proprietor of a tobacconist's shop in Woolston. He then reverted to amateur football with Bitterne Guild F.C., Salisbury City and Woolston F.C., although he did make one further appearance for the Saints in the 1907 Southern Charity Cup Final.

He died at West End, Hampshire on 24 March 1947.

Jeffrey Neilson "Jeff" Taylor (20 September 1930 – 28 December 2010) was an English professional football forward, who played in the Football League for Huddersfield Town, Fulham and Brentford. He went on to perform opera.

In an eight-year career as a professional footballer, Taylor played in the First Division, Second Division and Third Division South of the Football League for Huddersfield Town, Fulham and Brentford respectively. Taylor scored in double-figures in his first two seasons with Huddersfield Town. He moved to Fulham in 1951, hitting a hattrick in one of his early appearances against Middlesbrough, before his music studies began to take precedence and he dropped out of the first team picture. He was Brentford's second-highest scorer in the 1956–57 season, his last in football. Taylor finished his career having scored 84 goals in 204 games. Looking back in 1997 on his premature retirement, Taylor said, "singing won the day. I had no long-term ambitions in football and I realised that it was impossible to marry the two".

While still a footballer, Taylor was able to use his wages to pay for his studies in singing and piano at the Royal Academy of Music. Taylor performed opera under the name "Neilson Taylor" and was a bass baritone. After retiring from football, he joined the Yorkshire Opera Company. Taylor moved on in 1962 to understudy Michel Roux in "Pelléas et Mélisande "and Walter Alberti and John Shirley-Quirk in "L'incoronazione di Poppea "at Glyndebourne. His time at Glyndebourne proved to be a breakthrough and he toured the world, spending time in Australia and a year at Mantua in Italy, which led to work at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden and in Rotterdam. Taylor failed fully to deliver on his promise as a singer, but found fulfilment when he was made Professor of Singing at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music in Glasgow, remaining in the role for 18 years.

His younger brother, Ken Taylor also played football for Huddersfield. Ken was also a professional cricketer, playing three Tests for England and first-class cricket for Yorkshire. Ken's son (Jeff's nephew) Nick Taylor also played cricket for Yorkshire. While still a footballer, Taylor studied for a degree in Geography at London University. After retiring from teaching, Taylor retired to Yorkshire.

Bobby Coy

Robert Antony Coy (born 30 November 1961) is an English former footballer who played as a defender in the Football League for three clubs in the 1980s.

Coy began his career as an apprentice with Wolverhampton Wanderers, signing professional forms in November 1979. He had to wait until the 1981–82 season for his league debut, which he made on 12 September 1981 in a 0-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.

He went on to make 21 top-flight appearances during his first season. Although Wolves were relegated at the end of the season, Coy was involved in them winning promotion in 1982–83. However, he only played five times the following season (when Wolves were once again relegated) and in March 1984 he joined Division Four's bottom side Chester City in a joint loan deal with David Wintersgill. Coy's loan was quickly made permanent. He played in all of Chester's final 14 games of the season, including a spell at centre forward.

Coy became an established figure in a defence including future England international Lee Dixon, Andy Holden, Martin Lane and Peter Zelem and he went on to make 35 league appearances in 1984–85. This increased to 44 in 1985–86, when Chester were Division Four runners-up and Coy was named as player of the season.
But Coy was then surprisingly released by manager Harry McNally and he joined Northampton Town.

He enjoyed another promotion as the Cobblers won Division Four in 1986–87, but he made just 17 appearances for them and did not play again after promotion. After a spell on loan with Altrincham, Coy joined Southern League side Aylesbury. Once more there was promotion joy for Coy, and he played in their solitary season in the GM Vauxhall Conference.

Coy then played lower down the non-league pyramid for Moor Green, Armitage and Boldmere St Michaels, before he retired at the end of the 1996–97 season. Away from football he has worked in insurance and as a sales rep.

Frederick William Mouncher (19 November 1883 – 17 February 1918) was an English professional footballer who played as a winger for Southampton and Fulham in the 1900s.

Mouncher was born in Southampton and played as an amateur with local sides Fitzhugh Rovers and Southampton Cambridge. He started his professional career in the summer of 1903 at The Dell where he teamed up with his former colleague at Fitzhugh Rovers, Fred Harrison. He made his debut for Southampton on 26 September 1903 at outside left, replacing Joe Turner for one match. In February, he started a longer run as replacement to the injured John Fraser, and played a total of ten games as the "Saints" took the Southern League title for the sixth (and last) time.

He joined Southampton's summer 1904 tour of South America, during which they played teams representing Argentina and Uruguay, winning 8–0 and 8–1 respectively. Mouncher, who was a "fast, direct forward", retained the left wing position for the start of the following season, but his lack of consistency led to him being dropped in favour of the veteran Harry Wood. He was recalled later in the season on the right, making a total of twenty appearances in 1904–05. For 1905–06 he featured more regularly, missing only two matches and contributing six goals, and at the end of the season he nearly joined Dundee who offered him "flattering terms"

Chris Slater

Christopher James Slater (born 14 January 1984) is an English former professional footballer.

He had given up on becoming a professional footballer in 2005 after being released by Wolverhampton Wanderers, and joined non-league Chasetown, where he won the Midland Football Alliance title in 2005–06. However, after victory over Port Vale in the FA Cup in December 2007, he turned professional at Vale Park. He spent eleven months in the English Football League, before returning to Chasetown. He helped the club to win promotion in 2010, and went on to beat the club's all-time appearance record. He joined Walsall Wood in June 2017 and helped the club to win the Midland League Division One title during the 2017–18 season.

Released from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2005 without a first-team appearance to his name, Slater joined non-league Chasetown. Helping the "Chase" take Oldham Athletic to a replay at Boundary Park in the first round of the FA Cup in November 2005 was just the beginning of Slater's and Chasetown's cup adventures. By April 2006 he had won a trial with Tranmere Rovers, and was also being looked at by Blackpool and Crewe Alexandra, all English Football League clubs. He helped Chasetown to win the Midland Football Alliance title at the end of the 2005–06 season. He was at The Scholar Ground for the first season of the new Southern League Division One Midlands tier (2006–07). He came to prominence when playing in Chasetown's 1–0 FA Cup victory over League One Port Vale in December 2007. In doing this he helped Chasetown become the lowest ever ranked club to reach as far as the Third Round (proper) of the FA Cup. Vale was the eighth club Chasetown had vanquished in their campaign that season. In his three years at the club he had played 146 league games for the "Scholars", scoring one goal.

He was signed by Lee Sinnott's Port Vale, along with Chasetown teammate Kyle Perry, in January 2008 for a nominal fee and gave up his day job as a block paver. He made his League One debut as a 70th minute substitute in a 2–0 defeat to Swansea City on 19 January 2008. He played four further league games that season, all of them defeats as the Vale were relegated into League Two. After appearing in six league and two cup games for the "Valiants" in 2008–09, Slater was released from his contract in mid-November, and subsequently re-joined Chasetown.

Slater was once again a key member of the Chasetown team, playing 33 games in the 2008–09 season, as they reached the play-off final, only to lose out 1–0 to Nuneaton Town. He played another 35 league games in 2009–10, helping the club gain promotion out of the Northern Premier League Division One South via the play-offs with a 1–0 win over Glapwell. He remained at the club throughout 2010–11, as the club competed at the seventh level of the English football league pyramid for the first time in its history. However the "Scholars" could not survive at such a high level, and were relegated in 2011–12. They reached the Division One South play-off final in 2012–13, where they were beaten 2–1 by Stamford. The club finished 12th in 2013–14 and 13th in 2014–15, and Slater exceeded 500 appearances for the club in April 2015. He left the club at the end of the 2016–17 season having broken the club's all-time appearance record.

Slater joined Midland League side Walsall Wood after being signed by Gary Birch in June 2017. He helped the "Prims" to win the Division One title at the end of the 2017–18 season.

Spruce was born in Chester and was invited for trials with Bolton Wanderers in August 1939 while playing local football in Chester, but the outbreak of war ended his hopes of joining the club. He finally got his chance in professional football in October 1948 when he joined Wrexham from Chester-based side Heath Rangers and played regularly before moving to Football League Second Division side Barnsley in May 1952. His spell at Wrexham overlapped with his younger brother Phil's time at the club, for whom he played from 1950 to 1956.

Although Barnsley were relegated in George's first season at the club, he was a regular part of the side when they topped Division Three North in 1954–55. He remained at Oakwell for two years before joining hometown club Chester in July 1958. At 35 he was one of Chester's oldest debutants when he played for the club for the first time against York City three months later. Spruce scored an own goal in the final minute in a 2–2 draw but went on to make 63 appearances for the club over the next three years.

Chester was to be Spruce's last league club and he played for Runcorn and Prestatyn before hanging up his boots. He was employed by the gas board and then worked as a taxicab driver.

Tommy Logan

Thomas Logan (17 August 1888 – 21 June 1962) was a Scottish footballer, who played for Falkirk and Chelsea.

Born in Barrhead, Logan began his senior career with local club Arthurlie of Scotland's second tier in 1908, moving to Falkirk, at that time one of the top teams in the country, in 1910, following a trial. During the initial months of his first season at Brockville Park (in which the club eventually finished in third place), his elder brother Alec was a teammate prior to a transfer to England; another older sibling James was also a professional footballer who played in England, becoming an opponent after he moved back home in 1912 to play with Rangers.

With the "Bairns", Logan lifted the Scottish Cup after a 2–0 win over Raith Rovers in the 1913 final at Celtic Park, scoring the second goal; it was the club's first major honour, and he joined Chelsea within a few weeks. a year later he was joined at Stamford Bridge by another member of that Falkirk team, Jimmy Croal.

Logan was a member of the Chelsea side that reached the 1915 FA Cup Final. He was one of the few Chelsea players to get a positive mention in the Manchester Guardian report on the final for a few "dashing excursions" into the Sheffield half, he failed to score. By then, he was judged to be "an ideal centre half who showed judgement in his play", although in his early years he had been considered a forward and had a good scoring ratio for Falkirk. He was playing further back when capped by Scotland.

Logan's career was interrupted by World War I, during which he had loan spells back in Scotland (where the domestic league continued, unlike in England) with Partick Thistle, Dunfermline Athletic and back at Falkirk. His military service included the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders whose regimental team he represented.

He was contracted to Chelsea until July 1922 (although his last appearance for the club was in November 1920) and made a total of 116 appearances scoring 8 goals in total. In his mid-30s, he returned to Arthurlie, then playing in the "Western League" – a wartime competition which continued for several years due to the slow reorganisation of lower league football in Scotland.

Logan represented Scotland once, appearing in a 1913 British Home Championship match against Ireland while with Falkirk.

Kevin Russell (footballer)

Kevin John Russell (born 6 December 1966) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker for Brighton & Hove Albion, Portsmouth, Wrexham, Leicester City, Peterborough United, Cardiff City, Hereford United, Stoke City, Burnley, Bournemouth and Notts County.

A former England Youth international, Russell (nicknamed "Rooster" early in his career because of his quiff); later to lose all his hair) was a professional footballer who played for 11 clubs in a career spanning nearly 20 years. Released by Brighton after an apprenticeship Russell returned to his hometown club Portsmouth but appearances were limited He then moved on to Wrexham during the 1987 close season. In the first of his two spells with the club he scored at a rate of just over a goal every two games. In 1989, he joined Leicester City, but was loaned out four times. However, he fought his way into the first team at the end of the 1991–92 season and became a cult-hero, scoring several important late goals after coming off the bench as he helped fire Leicester to the play-off final, eventually losing to Blackburn Rovers. Despite this, he went to Stoke City at the end of the season. While at Stoke he became a key member of the first team as Stoke won the Second Division title in 1992–93.

After one season at Stoke City, he moved onto Burnley for a fee of £130,000. Short spells with Bournemouth and Notts County followed before a move back to the Racecourse Ground. Here, at last, Russell found a permanent home – he was to play nearly 200 more league games for The Robins in a deeper role, eventually being rewarded with a testimonial against Manchester United. In his second spell at Wrexham, he was best remembered for his winning goal against West Ham in an FA Cup third round replay in the 1996–97 season. With the tie goalless, Russell scored a 90th-minute goal to dump West Ham out of the cup at Upton Park. 

He remained at the club as a coach until being sacked in January 2007. On 12 January 2011, he agreed to rejoin Peterborough United, with Darren Ferguson for a second spell. On 18 August 2014, it was confirmed that he rejoined Stoke City as a coach for the Under 21 and Under 18 sides. He was promoted to Stoke City U23s manager for the 2018–19 season. In January 2019 he began work, alongside Andy Quy, assisting Stoke's new caretaker manager Rory Delap.

Kyle Naughton

Kyle Naughton (born 17 November 1988) is an English professional footballer who plays as a right back for club Swansea City.

Naughton was a product of Sheffield United's academy before breaking into their first team in 2008, transferring to Tottenham Hotspur the following year. He has represented England at under-21 level as well as having loan spells with Gretna, Middlesbrough, Leicester City and Norwich City.

Naughton was born in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. He was a product of Sheffield United's centre of excellence and academy, having trained with the club the age of seven. He attended an England under-15 training camp during the 2004–05 season, and over the years has become a regular in the Academy and reserve teams. He captained his club's academy team to the quarter-finals of the FA Youth Cup in the 2006–07 season.

He was signed by Scottish Premier League team Gretna on loan in January 2008, and made his league debut for Gretna against Rangers on 16 January 2008. He played regularly for the rest of the season at the troubled Scottish club who were placed into administration during his tenure there. Despite this Naughton continued for Gretna as the Blades agreed to cover insurance payments needed to allow him to play. Naughton played 19 times for the club but was unable to help them avoid relegation.
Naughton made his first team debut for the Blades the following season, coming on as a second-half substitute in the first round of the League Cup against Port Vale in August 2008. In his second substitute appearance for the club he netted the winning goal in a 2–1 League Cup success over Yorkshire rivals Huddersfield Town.

Naughton made his league debut on 20 September 2008 against Norwich City, he then went on to make his first start for Sheffield United in their 2–1 victory over Watford on 27 September 2008, gaining the man of the match award. From that point he cemented his place in the starting eleven and was virtually ever present for the rest of the season, becoming first choice at right back whilst also making a couple of appearances in midfield and finishing the season playing at left back to cover for the injured Gary Naysmith. His successful season was rewarded when he was voted Young Player of the Year by the United supporters club, was runner up to Matthew Kilgallon in the senior Player of the Year award and was included in the Championship PFA Team of the Year.

Despite major interest from Everton, Naughton signed for Tottenham Hotspur in July 2009 along with fellow Sheffield United player Kyle Walker for a combined fee of £9 million. He made his Spurs non-competitive debut against Barcelona in the 2009 Wembley Cup which ended in a 1–1 draw. He came on as a substitute in the 94th minute in the match against West Ham United, which was the club's third match in the 2009–10 season to mark his debut in the Premier League. Naughton then signed a six-month loan deal with Middlesbrough on 1 February 2010. He made his debut in the 1–1 draw against Ipswich Town.

After returning to Tottenham he was loaned out again initially until January to another Championship club, Leicester City. He made his debut on 16 October in a 1–1 draw against Hull City. In his second match for Leicester City, against Leeds United, he scored the second league goal of his career. He scored again for Leicester City in the 5–1 win against Doncaster Rovers. He also scored against Barnsley in a 4–1 win on 5 February with a 30-yard drive into the top corner. Naughton also scored a 25-yard rocket to equalise for Leicester in the M69 derby against Coventry. On 12 March, Naughton scored Leicester's 3rd goal in their 3–0 win over Scunthorpe. Leicester extended Naughton's loan until the end of the 2010–11 season on 8 January after a permanent move failed to materialise. In April, Naughton was named as right back in the Championship PFA Team of the Year for the second time in three years and won the Leicester City Young Player of the Year award.

On 21 July 2011, Naughton signed a season-long loan deal to Premier League team Norwich City from Tottenham Hotspur. He was handed squad number 25 for his year in Norfolk. Naughton was an unused substitute for the Canaries opening Premier League fixture against Wigan Athletic on 13 August 2011. Naughton displaced Russell Martin as the first-choice right back, and started the matches against Stoke, Chelsea and West Brom. In all, he made twenty-three appearances over the course of the season at either right back or centre back.

Naughton made his first full league start for Tottenham on 16 September 2012 away to Reading, a match in which Tottenham won 3–1.

Naughton joined Swansea City on 22 January 2015 for a reported £5 million. Naughton quickly established himself as first choice right back for Swansea, before being ruled out for the remainder of the 2014–15 Premier League season with ankle ligament damage in a 3–1 victory over Hull City.

In November 2008, after only eleven league appearances, Naughton was called up to the England under-21 team for the friendly against the Czech Republic under-21 team at Bramall Lane. He duly made his England debut, coming on as a 60th-minute substitute in a 2–0 victory. Naughton is also eligible to play for the Republic of Ireland national team.

Oliver Risser

Oliver Hanjorge Risser (born 17 September 1980) is a Namibian international footballer who plays for Belgian Third Division B side KFC Oosterzonen. Risser is a defensive midfielder, and can also play in central defence. He is of German descent.

Born in Windhoek, Risser started his senior career with SpVgg EGC Wirges in 1999 and moved to Borussia Dortmund's reserve team in 2003, spending two seasons with the club in the German third division. He spent most of the 2005–06 season with SV Sandhausen in Oberliga Baden-Württemberg, one of the leagues in the fourth tier of German football. In April 2006, he moved to Icelandic first-division side Breidablik for three months, before returning to fourth-division football in Germany and signing with Bonner SC of Oberliga Nordrhein, where spent the entire 2006–07 season. He moved to Hannover 96 II in January 2008 after a few months without a club, but left the club at the end of the season. After another eight months without a club, Risser moved to Norway, joining Manglerud Star in March 2009.

On 21 August 2009, Lyn agreed a loan deal for him from Manglerud Star.

In June 2011, Risser went on a one-week trial with English League Two side Swindon Town, and after three days, manager Paolo Di Canio announced that Risser was to be offered a contract. He signed a two-year deal along with Ibrahim Atiku on the same day, 10 July. Ten days later, on 20 July, he was named Swindon captain for the 2011–12 season. He made a goalscoring debut for Swindon, netting the club's second goal with a 30-yard strike against Crewe Alexandra in a 3–0 win at The County Ground on the opening day of the season. In October 2011, Risser was replaced by Paul Caddis as club captain after losing his place in the side due to a groin injury. He scored his second goal for the club in a 1–1 draw against AFC Wimbledon in the Football League Trophy on 8 November 2011, a game in which Swindon went on to win 3–1 on penalties. Risser received the first red card of his Swindon career in a 2–1 away win against Northampton Town, receiving a straight red card for a tackle on Northampton's John Johnson. He went on to score two further goals during the campaign, in 2–0 victories against Torquay United and Barnet respectively. Risser made 40 appearances during the season, scoring four goals,<ref name="Games played by Oliver Risser in 2011/2012"></ref> as Swindon were promoted to League One as champions.

In August 2012, Risser joined League One side Stevenage on loan until January 2013, with a view to a permanent move. He made his Stevenage debut in the club's 3–2 loss to Dagenham & Redbridge in the Football League Trophy on 4 September 2012. Risser scored his first goal for Stevenage in a 1–1 draw against Doncaster Rovers at the Keepmoat Stadium on 22 September; netting with a glancing header from a Filipe Morais cross. He went on to make 13 appearances during the loan spell, although Stevenage turned down the option to make the move permanent, and Risser returned to his parent club in January 2013.

Shortly after returning to Swindon, it was announced that Risser had left the club after his contract was terminated by mutual consent. He subsequently signed for League Two side Aldershot Town on a free transfer on 6 January. Under manager Dean Holdsworth, he was a regular fixture in the side but after the arrival of new manager Andy Scott he was limited to appearances on the bench. By the end of the season he had made 15 appearances for Aldershot, scoring no goals. Risser was then believed to be one of the thirteen players made redundant as a result of the club going to administration.

Risser has 27 caps for the Namibia national football team and represented Namibia at the 2008 African Cup of Nations.

Risser's younger brother, Wilko, is also a footballer.

Kyle Perry

Kyle Blain Perry (born 5 March 1986) is an English footballer who plays as a forward for Southern League Premier Central side Alvechurch.

Failing to make the first team at Walsall, he dropped into non-league circles with AFC Telford United, Sutton Coldfield Town, Hednesford Town, and Willenhall Town, before impressing when non-league Chasetown knocked Port Vale out of the FA Cup. Failing to score for the Vale, he dropped down into the Conference National with Mansfield Town in June 2009. The following year he moved on to Tamworth, before signing with Lincoln in summer 2011. He re-joined his former club AFC Telford United on loan in January 2012, before signing with Nuneaton Town seven months later. He was loaned out to Hereford United in October 2012. He joined Tamworth on loan in February 2013. He joined Altrincham in May 2013, and helped the club to win promotion out of the Conference North via the play-offs in 2014. He later played for Hednesford Town, Worcester City, Stafford Rangers, Barwell, Stourbridge, Coalville Town, Bromsgrove Sporting and Alvechurch.

Born in Birmingham, West Midlands, Perry joined the Centre of Excellence at Walsall as an eleven-year-old and developed through the club's youth structure to be one of seven players, including Matty Fryatt, to sign a three-year scholarship for the club in March 2002; the scholarship commencing at the start to the 2002–03 season. He later said he did not enjoy his time at the Bescot Stadium as he was picked on by the older youth-team players. In the third and final year of his scholarship, Perry joined up with then Northern Premier League First Division side AFC Telford United on a temporary basis, scoring twice on his debut: a 2–0 victory at Gresley Rovers on 14 September 2004 the goals being scored against his cousin Dale Belford. He continued with Telford for the remainder of the season, whilst continuing to play for Walsall's reserve team, an issue that concerned Telford's then manager Bernard McNally. Having scored 23 goals for the Bucks as they secured promotion, Perry agreed to join the club permanently in July 2005.

In October 2005, he joined Sutton Coldfield Town on loan, debuting in the club's Southern League Western Division 2–0 home victory over Taunton Town on 22 October 2005. A week later his scored his first goal for the club in their 2–2 draw with Ashford Town. His final game for the club saw his score the consolation goal in a 2–1 defeat at Thame United on 5 November 2011 before he returned to AFC Telford United. He later had a brief spell on loan at Moor Green. Despite his tally of 32 goals in 68 games he was released in July 2006. This was despite the fact that the 20 year old's goal tally had actually made him the top scorer in the young club's history, his record standing until 1 December 2008 when Lee Moore bagged his 33rd.

He joined Northern Premier League newcomers Hednesford Town in the summer of 2006, but only played one game for the "Pitmen" – the opening day defeat against Marine before being released by manager Phil Starbuck. He then moved to Southern League Division One Midlands side Willenhall Town on £70-a-week, where he formed a potent partnership with Matthew Barnes-Homer. Perry went on to score 26 goals for the "Reds" and was selected in the Southern Football Division One Midlands Team of the year, but was not selected to play in the play-off final defeat to Bromsgrove Rovers. After a prolific season at Noose Lane, he joined Chasetown in the summer of 2007. Another excellent return in front of goal saw him play in Chasetown's 1–0 FA Cup victory over Port Vale in December 2007. In doing this he helped Chasetown become the lowest ever ranked club to reach as far as the third round proper of the FA Cup.

He signed for Port Vale along with Chasetown teammate Chris Slater on 11 January 2008 for a nominal fee and gave up his day job as a graphic designer. He made his debut for Port Vale as a 57th-minute substitute in a 2–0 defeat to Swansea City in January 2008. Perry later thanked Vale boss Lee Sinnott for saving his career.

In December 2008, after not making an appearance for Vale in three months, Perry made it clear his intentions were to earn a spot in the first team and brushed off rumours that he would follow Chris Slater back into non-league football. However, by February 2009, he was informed that he would not be offered a new contract in the summer.

On 6 March 2009, he joined Northwich Victoria on a one-month loan. This move was extended to a two-month loan as Perry hit two goals in four games for the club. After three further games the popular striker was recalled by Vale manager Dean Glover after the club's strike force were hit with injuries. After speaking to several clubs, Perry signed for Mansfield Town on 24 June 2009 on a two-year contract.

In his first three appearances for Mansfield he scored twice against Crawley Town and once against Salisbury City, though also scored an own goal in the 4–1 defeat to Luton Town. By the end of the campaign he had netted ten goals in all competitions.

In July 2010, whilst in a middle of a two-year deal with the "Stags", Perry left the club by mutual consent to join Conference National rivals Tamworth. There he bagged seventeen goals in forty games in his first and only season at the club. In July 2011, he rejected deals with Tamworth, to sign a two-year contract at fellow Conference club Lincoln City, who had lost their Football League status earlier in the year. On 5 January 2012, Perry re-joined his former team AFC Telford on loan until the end of the 2011–12 season. He scored just once in 19 appearances, ironically against Lincoln at Sincil Bank. In the fixture at New Bucks Head, before his loan spell, he scored twice in a 2–1 win for Lincoln. He was told he was free to leave Lincoln, and did so at the end of the season.

He signed with Nuneaton Town in July 2012, having been impressed by manager Kevin Wilkin. He joined Martin Foyle's Hereford United on a one-month loan in October 2012. Despite not starting a game for the "Bulls", his loan spell was extended into a second month. He failed to find the net in nine league and cup games at Edgar Street, though seven of his appearances were as a substitute. He returned to former club Tamworth on loan until the end of the 2012–13 season in February 2013; "Lambs" manager Dale Belford signed him due to injuries to Peter Till and Scott Barrow. He played 12 games each for both Nuneaton and Tamworth without scoring a goal in the 2012–13 season, as both clubs attained mid-table finishes.

Perry signed with Altrincham in May 2013, re-joining his former Vale manager Lee Sinnott. He scored 12 goals in 38 league games in the 2013–14 season, helping "Alty" to secure a place in the play-offs, and Perry played in the final as the club secured promotion with a 2–1 extra-time victory over Guiseley. He scored eight goals in 47 appearances in the 2014–15 campaign, before being released in the summer.

Perry joined Hednesford Town of the Conference North in May 2015. In March 2016, he switched to league rivals Worcester City after what he described as an "ugly experience" at relegated Hednesford, and scored one goal and provided two assists during his eight games to keep Worcester out of the relegation zone at the end of the 2015–16 season.

He joined Stafford Rangers in August 2016, having been released by Worcester earlier in the summer. Perry was the club's top-scorer as Rangers finished 13th in the Northern Premier League Premier Division at the end of the 2016–17 season. However he found first-team football at Marston Road hard to come by early in the 2017–18 season, and switched to divisional rivals Barwell in August 2017. He moved on to Stourbridge, also of the Northern Premier League Premier Division, the following month. He returned to Stafford Rangers in February 2018. The club posted a 14th-place finish at the end of the 2017–18 season.

On 15 November 2018, Perry signed for Southern League Premier Division Central side Coalville Town. He left the club on 18 March 2019. On 25 June 2019, Perry joined Bromsgrove Sporting. He switched to Alvechurch in September 2019 as part of manager Darren Byfield's revamp of the "Church".

Perry was called up to England C in November 2009.

Perry's cousin is former Tamworth goalkeeper, Dale Belford. His brother, Todd, also played non-league football and the pair were teammates at some clubs. He has a son and is separated from the child's mother. He sings in a wedding band called Function Band Live and previously was in a band called StubbleMelt.

Craig Whitington

Craig Whitington (born 3 September 1970) is an English former professional footballer, who played for Crawley Town, Scarborough, Huddersfield Town and Rochdale. His father, Eric is also a former professional footballer who played for Chelsea and Brighton & Hove Albion.

Whitington began his playing career at non-league Worthing in the late 1980s. He then moved onto Crawley in 1991 after he netted a hat-trick at Town Mead in an FA Cup clash with Worthing.

In 1990 Whitington joined Crawley Town, the team his father Eric had been a fan's favourite at some years before. Whitington played in the team that reached the third round of the FA Cup in 1991, losing 5-0 at the Goldstone Ground against Brighton & Hove Albion. He scored 75 goals in 173 appearances which prompted interest from Cyprus club Omonicosia, but they couldn't meet the asking price of £100,000. That was a disappointment, as in the same season they went on to play Juventus in the European Cup. Then in December 1993, Fourth Division Scarborough to pay £50,000 for his services.

In 1993 Whitington arrived in Scarborough after being signed by former Crawley boss Steve Wicks and in his only proper run in the Football League he scored 10 goals in 27 appearances. Then in the summer of 1994, the then Huddersfield Town manager, Neil Warnock signed Whitington for £20,000 after seeing him in a pre-season Yorkshire Electricity Cup clash against Huddersfield for Scarborough.

Whitington was placed on the bench for a Coca-Cola Cup tie with Scunthorpe United and then the next game against Leyton Orient Whitington made his debut wearing the number 10 shirt alongside Andrew Booth. It turned out to be his only game for the club and he was sent out to Rochdale during the 1994–95 season. Whitington remained at Town until he was sacked in early 1996 for a drugs offence.

Whitington's ban for his drugs offence lasted for 10 months and when the ban was completed the only club that showed any interest were his old club; Crawley Town. However, he failed to live up to his promise and his second spell wasn't as good as the first and he left Crawley in 1997, due to a troublesome knee injury.

He didn't play football again until 1999 when he began turning out for Rottingdean United in the Brighton League. He returned to senior football in 2005-06 to play in the Sussex County League for Whitehawk under Ian Chapman.

In 2007 Whitington and his friends formed a football team called Brighton North End. Whitington played striker for the team that in their first season won the treble: Brighton League Division 2, the JW Whittington Cup and The Hove and Worthing Cup. They were subsequently promoted to the Brighton Premier League. Whitington was also secretary when the club was formed, before leaving sometime in 2008 after scoring 12 goals in 25 games over 2007 and 2008. He joined Three Bridges in 2008.

Andy Williams (footballer, born 1962)

Andrew Williams (born 29 July 1962) is a former footballer, who played for 278 league games in an eleven-year professional career in the Football League. He turned out for Coventry City, Rotherham United, Leeds United, Port Vale, Notts County, Huddersfield Town, Hull City and Scarborough. He also played for non-league sides Dudley Town, Solihull Borough, Guiseley, Gainsborough Trinity, and Matlock Town. He was named in the PFA Team of the Year for the Third Division in 1987–88, and helped Leeds to the Second Division title in 1989–90.

Williams started in non-league with Dudley Town and Solihull Borough, before he was signed by First Division side Coventry City in 1985 for a fee of £20,000, at the age of 23. He played ten games for the club, before he was allowed to sign with Rotherham United of the Third Division in October 1986. The "Millers" were relegated at the end of the 1987–88 season after losing to Swansea City at the semi-final stage of the Fourth Division play-offs. Despite this, Williams was still chosen in the PFA Team of the Year for his strong performances throughout the season. His performances also won him a £175,000 move to Leeds United in November 1988, then a Second Division side. He went on to make nineteen appearances in 1988–89, eleven of which were as a substitute. He was the first signing of manager Howard Wilkinson.

Leeds won promotion back to the top-flight after topping the Second Division table at the end of the 1989–90 season; Williams made thirteen league starts, scoring two goals (against Watford and Barnsley). His first team appearances were limited by a groin injury. After spending five months out with his groin problem he then suffered a fractured cheekbone after teammate Vinnie Jones accidentally hit him in the face with a cricket bat. United then went on to power to a fourth-place finish in the top-flight in 1990–91, with Williams making five starts and seven substitute appearances. Restricted to the odd appearance by the form of the Leeds midfield, in December 1991 he was loaned out to Second Division side Port Vale. He played five games for the "Valiants", who would finish the season in last place; in contrast Williams returned to Elland Road, where manager Howard Wilkinson was in the process of bringing Leeds the First Division title. Williams would be gone before the end of the season however, and in February 1992 he was sold on to Notts County for a £115,000 fee. County were struggling in the First Division, and lost their top-flight status at the end of the 1991–92 season.

After a mid-table finish in 1992–93, County loaned Williams out to Second Division Huddersfield Town at the start of the 1993–94 campaign. He played six games for the "Terriers", before he was allowed to re-sign with former club Rotherham United in October 1993. He struggled with a knee injury, and at the end of the 1994–95 season he moved on to league rivals Hull City – who had tried to sign him in 1988 but lost out to Leeds. Hull finished bottom of the league in 1995–96, and so were relegated into the Third Division. Williams left Hull but remained in the fourth tier, signing non-contract terms with Scarborough. He made his debut in a goalless home draw with Cardiff City on 17 August, and also played in a League Cup draw at former club Hull three days later. This was to be his last professional game, though he did later turn out for non-league clubs Guiseley, Gainsborough Trinity, and Matlock Town.

The Rotherham United website states that Williams was a "tall midfielder with a deceptive turn of speed."

Williams now works as a performance manager for a company attached to Rotherham Council. He also plays Masters Football. He is a West Bromwich Albion supporter.

Charlie Wilson (footballer, born 1895)

Charles Wilson (30 March 1895 in – May 1971) was an English footballer who played in the Football League for Tottenham Hotspur, Huddersfield Town and Stoke City.

Wilson was born in Atherstone, Warwickshire and began his career with local non-league side Atherstone Town before joining Southern League side Coventry City just before the outbreak of World War I. After being demobbed he played six times for Tottenham Hotspur in the 1918–19 season, although for reasons unknown he decided to hide his identity. In four of these games he played under the name of "C. Williams" being described as a "clot from the Midlands" and in the other under the pseudonym of "C. Forshaw". Only in the sixth did he finally take to the field as Charlie Wilson. With the war over the Football League returned and Wilson scored 11 goals for Spurs in the 1919–20 season helping them claim the Second Division title.

He scored 9 goals in 1920–21 and 11 in 1921–22 witch prompted Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman to bring Wilson to Leeds Road. He soon became a key member of Towns all conquering 1920s side as he scored 16 goals in 1922–23 as Huddersfield finished in 3rd position. He then scored 20 goals in 1923–24 and 24 in 1924–25 as Huddersfield claimed the First Division title. However, with Huddersfield on their way to a third straight title Wilson picked up an injury early in the 1925–26 season and so decided to put him up for sale.

Stoke City manager Tom Mather persuaded Wilson to join the Victoria Ground side and he joined Stoke along with his Huddersfield Town teammate, Joey Williams. The pair could not prevent Stoke slipping to relegation to the Third Division North. In 1926–27 Wilson's quality in front of goal proved too much for Third Division defences as he racked up 26 goals as Stoke won the title with ease. Back in the Second Division for 1927–28 Wilson had a fine season scoring a club record 38 goals. He continued to be top scorer hitting 22 in 1928–29 and 20 in 1929–30 becoming the first Stoke player to reach 100 league goals. He struggled with injury in 1930–31 scoring 10 in 16 games and left the club at the end of the season.

After leaving Stoke he played non-league football with Stafford Rangers whilst keeping the Doxey Hotel. He later played for Wrexham, Shrewsbury Town and Alfreton United before later becoming landlord of the Noah's Ark pub in Stafford. He died in May 1971 at the age of 76.

Steve Ludlam (born 18 October 1955, Chesterfield) was an English professional footballer who played as a Midfielder. He played in The Football League for Sheffield United, Carlisle United and Chester.

Ludlam began his career with Sheffield United, where he turned professional in January 1973. He had to wait until December 1975 for his first-team debut, against Tottenham Hotspur, but went on to make 27 league appearances over the next season and a half. He moved to Carlisle United in May 1977 and spent the next three seasons at Brunton Park, before opting to join fellow Football League Division Three side Chester in July 1980. The £45,000 transfer was a record buy for Chester at the time.

Ludlam made his Chester debut on the opening day of the 1980–81 season, in a 1–0 home defeat to Oxford United. He ended the season as the club's joint leading scorer with seven goals, as Chester managed just 38 in 46 league games. He remained a regular for two years before playing his final game away to Mansfield Town on 26 February 1983. That would also mark the end of this Football League career.

He played in Finland for six months before having spells training with Chester, Blackpool and Rochdale. But he did not sign for any of them amid ongoing injury problems and he retired from the professional game at the relatively early age of 28. Ludlam then had spells playing non-league football with Rhyl and Buxton.

Ludlam worked in the licensing and legal trades and then for the Royal Mail. He remained involved in football by working with youngsters at Sheffield Wednesday, Chesterfield and Rotherham United.

In 2003, Ludlam became manager of Worksop Town, where one of his sons, Ryan, was on the playing staff. He remained with the club until the end of the 2003–04 season, when he was replaced by Ronnie Glavin.

Simon Haworth

Simon Owen Haworth (born 30 March 1977) is a Welsh former footballer who played as a striker. He won five caps for the Wales national football team during his career. He is currently manager at Stalybridge Celtic.

Born in Cardiff, Haworth began his career at Cardiff City on a Youth Training Scheme and broke into the first team due to an injury crisis during the 1995–1996 season. He fully established himself the following year which led to him nearly signing for Norwich City only for the move to break down at the last minute. But after he earned his first cap for Wales he moved to Coventry City for £500,000, a record fee received for a player by Cardiff at the time, but struggled to find form for the club, scoring just once against Everton in the League Cup, and subsequently moved to Wigan Athletic for £600,000, a record signing for the club at the time.

He managed to show his ability for Wigan and helped them to win the Football League Trophy in the 1998–99 season. He was also the first Wigan player to score at their new JJB Stadium, doing so in a game against Scunthorpe United. Eventually leaving the club in February 2002 he joined Tranmere Rovers, linking up with former strike partner Stuart Barlow again. During the 2003–04 season he suffered a double fracture in his right leg which ruled him out for around eight months. He attempted a comeback in November 2004 but was in considerable pain due to his leg not being fully healed. He decided to call an end to his football career to concentrate on his business ventures.

Haworth made his debut for Wales on 27 May 1997 coming on as a substitute for goalscorer John Hartson in a 1–0 victory over Scotland. He went on to earn four more caps for Wales, against Brazil, Jamaica, Malta, and Tunisia. He was also called up for a friendly against Argentina in February 2002, however he stayed on the bench. Haworth was also called up to the Wales squad in May 2003 to play United States but withdrew through injury.

On 12 June 2014, Shrewsbury Town confirmed Haworth had joined the club's coaching staff.

On 29 April 2016, he was appointed as the manager of Clitheroe.

In May 2018 he moved to Stalybridge Celtic.

Terry Fleming

Terence Fleming (born 5 January 1973) is an English former professional footballer and coach.

He played as a midfielder from 1991 to 2016, a career spanning 25 years. During his professional career he notably played for Lincoln City, Cambridge United having started his career at Coventry City, where he played in the very first season of the Premier League. He also had spells with Northampton Town, Preston North End, Plymouth Argyle, Grimsby Town and Kidderminster Harriers before going to play for Non-League side's Moor Green, Halesowen Town and Grantham Town. In 2008, he joined Lincoln United and went on to manage the club from 2011 and 2013. In August 2015 he signed for Boston Town, continuing his playing career beyond his 43rd birthday.

Originally Fleming was a trainee with Coventry City before moving on to play for both Northampton Town and Preston North End. Though it was in his spell for Lincoln City that he really took off. Fleming was ever present in the centre of midfield and featured heavily in the club's promotion season in 1997–98.

In the summer of 2000, The Imps lost Fleming to Plymouth Argyle with fellow central midfielder John Finnigan also departing that season. Fleming then spent four impressive seasons with Cambridge United where he was heralded a cult hero by the supporters for his impressive performances. With the club cash strapped though Fleming left United at the end of the 2003–04 season and joined Grimsby Town on a free transfer.

At Grimsby Town, he formed a midfield partnership with fellow veteran Stacy Coldicott as Grimsby struggled and under performed in the 2004-2005 season. His performances were not good enough to earn himself a new deal with Grimsby, and both himself and Coldicott were released at the end of the season.

His next port of call was to sign for Kidderminster Harriers who had just been relegated out of the football league, after an average season, Fleming was released again and moved onto play for Moor Green (now known as Solihull Moors). Halesowen Town signed Fleming in 2007, along with two other former Football League players in the form of Stephen Cooke (who also played in the Premier League for Aston Villa) and Duane Darby. After he was released by the Yeltz, Fleming had a spell at Grantham Town.

Terry was named as Grantham Town's captain for the 2008-09 season, impressing Gingerbreads manager John Wilkinson with his professionalism and experience. However, following Wilkinson's departure from the club Fleming moved on to join Lincoln United. Fleming made his debut for the club in the abandoned game with Sheffield on 29 November 2008 with his official debut following in the 3-2 home victory over Stocksbridge Park Steels on 2 December 2008.

In 2011, he was appointed manager of Lincoln United as well as continuing with his playing career. 
On 10 April 2013 Fleming was dismissed as United's manager. He joined Sleaford Town in a playing capacity, debuting in the club's 1-1 United Counties League draw at Yaxley on 27 April 2013.

In June 2013 he was appointed player/assistant manager to Kris Jones at Sleaford Town with his one-time Lincoln City teammate Gavin Gordon as first team coach. In August 2014, he was appointed Interim Manager of the club following the injuries sustained by the club's manager Kris Jones in a car crash. 
He departed the club following a 0-0 draw at Deeping Rangers on 10 March 2015, a game which saw him sent-off for dissent. However, the red card had no bearing on the club's Board's decision to remove him from his role as Interim Manager, with Chairman Brian Rowland stating that it was a footballing decision based upon Sleaford's urgent need to acquire points in a battle against relegation.

In February 2016 he took over as assistant manager at Boston Town, having signed for the club as a player in August 2015. In October 2016 he joined the coaching staff at Northern Premier League side Spalding United.

On 13 February 2017 Fleming and manager Dave Frecklington left Spalding United to join National League North side Gainsborough Trinity. Flemimg was relieved of his duties when Frecklington lost his job on 7 February 2018. In late 2018 while an assistant coach at Matlock Town, Fleming came out of playing retirement to play against Basford United.

Fleming is professional footballer Jerell Sellars' step father.

Steve Brown (footballer, born 1972)

Steven Byron "Steve" Brown (born 13 May 1972) is an English former football player and most recently the manager of Margate.

Born in Brighton, Brown played youth football with Whitehawk, where his father Gary Brown was first team coach. He made his first team debut as a 15-year old in 1988 before being spotted playing for Brighton Boys by Charlton Athletic.

He began with Charlton Athletic in 1988-89 as a 16-year old, before turning professional at the club where he spent most of his career as a defender. Brown's spell at Charlton saw the club twice gain promotion to the Premier League, once as champions and the other in their dramatic win over Sunderland in the 1998 play-off final, winning 7-6 on penalties after a 4-4 draw, with Brown scoring one of the penalties. An extremely popular player with supporters, he also acquired the reputation of a versatile player; indeed, he played in goal four times for Charlton without conceding. This memorably happened in the Premier League against Aston Villa when Andy Petterson was sent off. He also captained the side on numerous occasions and played in the team that equalled the league record of 12 straight wins whilst in the First Division (now Championship). He was an integral part of the squad that retained Premier League status in 2001 and he helped Charlton secure their highest-ever finish in the Premier League before his departure in December 2002.

After over twelve years with Charlton, he was signed by former Charlton teammate Alan Pardew for Reading in late 2002. After two-and-a-half years, scoring once against Crystal Palace, he retired from the game with a recurrence of an anterior cruciate ligament injury which had ruptured earlier in his career.

Brown became a youth coach at Charlton Athletic before moving to West Ham United (by then managed by Pardew) to become reserve-team coach. He ended his role in July 2007 after Alan Pardew's dismissal led to changes in the back room staff. Brown then worked as head of football at Ardingly College whilst attaining his UEFA A Licence and led the school's first XI to the quarter-finals of the national cup. Whilst at Ardingly, Brown scouted for Charlton Athletic and was often heard commentating on the radio for BBC London.

After attaining his UEFA A Licence in 2008, Brown agreed to become the Brighton youth team manager. During his spell at Brighton his team finished second and fifth in the league and progressed through to the fourth and third rounds of the FA Youth Cup. In his two-year spell at Brighton, 11 youth players signed professional contracts, five of which made first-team appearances.

In 2011 Brown became Nicky Forster's assistant at Dover Athletic in the Conference South. Dover made the play off final in their second year in charge narrowly losing to Salisbury.

On 3 June 2013, Brown was appointed manager of Ebbsfleet United, succeeding Liam Daish. He appointed former Charlton player Steve Gritt as his assistant.

On 26 November 2014, Ebbsfleet United announced Brown's departure from the club, Brown left with a 52% win ratio and the club sat in fourth position in the league. The previous season saw Ebbsfleet win the Kent senior cup and make the playoff final in his first year as a manager.

On 4 March 2015, Brown was announced as the new interim manager of Isthmian Premier Division side Lewes until the end of this season. After ensuring the Sussex club's survival from relegation after winning 5 of the last 11 games, Brown was appointed Lewes manager on a permanent basis ahead of the 2015–16 season. On 24 September 2015, Brown's resignation was accepted by the Lewes board after a poor start to the season, Brown cited a 33% budget cut as the reason for his resignation.

A year later, he joined First Division side Charlton Athletic. He became a regular first teamer with Charlton, but after they were relegated in 1990 he moved onto Aston Villa the following year. After failing to establish himself at Villa Park under Ron Atkinson, Mortimer returned to South London with Crystal Palace.

A number of injury problems, mainly hamstring, meant he did not play many games for Crystal Palace. After less than three years he was transferred back to Charlton Athletic, alongside David Whyte in exchange for Darren Pitcher. Under the management of former teammate Alan Curbishley, Mortimer often played well in the early part of the season but then suffer hamstring or back injuries. At the start of the successful promotion winning 1997–98 season, against Bradford City he scored a spectacular goal where he turned his full back inside out before a shot to the bottom right of the goal. In this game Charlton won 4–1, and it was a performance that hailed of things to come that season. After helping the club into the Premier League in 1998, he again played in the country's top-flight missing a crucial penalty against Leeds United towards the end of the season. He left the following year, moving to lower league side Bristol City where he ended his career in 2001. At Bristol City, he scored once; his goal coming in a League Cup tie against Cambridge United.

Espinoza scored in the 12th minute, but Ohio State lost to Wake Forest, 2–1. In his one season at Ohio State, Espinoza was named first-team All-Big Ten, second-team all-region, and earned a spot the NCAA College Cup All-Tournament Team.

Espinoza opted to forgo his senior year of college and signed a Generation Adidas contract with Major League Soccer. He was selected with the 11th overall pick of the 2008 MLS SuperDraft by the Kansas City Wizards (now known as Sporting Kansas City). In his first season at the club, he appeared in 22 games and tied for third on the team in assists with 3. Playing as both a leftback and defensive midfielder, he appeared in 113 regular season matches over five years with the club and helped Sporting to victory in the 2012 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.

Following the 2012 MLS season, Espinoza signed with Wigan Athletic of the English Premier League on a free transfer. He was assigned number 18.

Espinoza made his Wigan Athletic debut on 19 January when he came on as a half-time substitute during a 2–3 loss against Sunderland. He scored his first goal for the club against Swansea City on 7 May. On 11 May 2013, Espinoza won the FA Cup with Wigan, playing the whole game in a 1–0 upset win against Manchester City. However, only three days later, Wigan were relegated from the Premier League following a 4–1 defeat against Arsenal. 
He scored his second goal for the club against MK Dons in the FA Cup on 4 January 2014. Espinoza scored his second league goal and provided an assist for teammate Shaun Maloney against Fulham on 1 November 2014 at the DW Stadium in a 3–3 draw.

However, Espinoza's minutes dwindled in the 2014–15 season, and he and Wigan agreed to part ways in December 2014.

Espinoza returned to Sporting Kansas City ahead of the 2015 season. In his second start since returning to Sporting, Espinoza scored an equalizing goal against FC Dallas on 14 March 2015. Espinoza saw his first season back in Kansas City curtailed through injury though the side still won the 2015 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. Espinoza played a key role as Sporting KC repeated the feat two years later, lifting the 2017 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup by beating the New York Red Bulls 2–1 at Children's Mercy Park. In the 2018 MLS season, Espinoza has set a new career-high with nine assists in a single season, having never produced more than five in the past.

Espinoza was called up to the Honduran national football team by Reinaldo Rueda for the UNCAF Nations Cup 2009 held in Honduras for the first time in his career. He made three appearances during the tournament where he wore number 13. He scored his first goal for the national team in a 1–0 win against El Salvador to give Honduras 3rd place in the competition.

Espinoza was called up by Luis Fernando Suárez to represent his country in the 2012 London Olympics; he scored a goal against Brazil in the quarter-final of the tournament, but was sent off in the 90th minute, receiving standing ovation from the Newcastle crowd for his performance.

Espinoza has represented Honduras at the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups.

On 16 August 2019, Espinoza announced his retirement from the Honduran national team.

Espinoza became a United States citizen in March 2008.

Brian Lloyd

Brian William Lloyd (born 18 March 1948) is a Welsh former footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He played 545 times in the Football League for five clubs and was capped three times by the Welsh national team.

He began his professional career at Stockport County in 1967, having signed from Rhyl. He transferred to Southend United two years later, before ending up at Wrexham in 1971. He spent six years as the Welsh club's first choice keeper, before he was sold to Chester City. In 1981, he was loaned out to Port Vale, before he re-signed for Stockport County. He left the Football League in 1983, and later spent some years in Welsh football with Bangor City, Colwyn Bay, Rhyl, and Lex XI. He won Player of the Year awards at both Wrexham and Chester City.

Lloyd began his career playing non-league football with Rhyl, where he played a handful of games before joining Jimmy Meadows's Stockport County for £1,000 in March 1967. The "Hatters" won the Fourth Division title in 1966–67. The club maintained a secure mid-table position in the Third Division in 1967–68 and 1968–69. He also played one game on loan at Northern Premier League side Macclesfield Town in 1968. After 32 league appearances for Stockport he moved to Southend United in September 1969 for £10,000. The "Shrimpers" finished 17th in the Fourth Division in 1969–70 and then 18th in 1970–71, hovering above the re-election zone under the stewardship of first Geoff Hudson and then Arthur Rowley.

Lloyd departed Roots Hall and returned to North Wales in August 1971, beginning a long stint with John Neal's Wrexham. Lloyd played 35 games in his first season at the Racecourse Ground and was then ever-present in league games in the next five years, as the club challenged for promotion from Third Division. The "Dragons" finished 12th in 1972–73, before finishing one place and five points behind the promotion places in 1973–74. Wrexham dropped to 13th in 1974–75, before rising to sixth in 1975–76, just three places and four points outside of the promotion places. Lloyd was the club's first winner of the Jack Williams Player of the Season accolade in 1975–76. The club again narrowly missed out on automatic promotion in 1976–77, finishing just one point behind third-placed Crystal Palace.

In September 1977, Lloyd made a surprise £6,000 move to local rivals Chester. He quickly replaced fellow Welshman Grenville Millington as the regular Chester goalkeeper and helped Alan Oakes's "Seals" to finish fifth in the Third Division in 1977–78, with Lloyd being named as the club's player of the season for his efforts. He was again first-choice the following season but an injury in September 1979 led to Millington replacing Lloyd in the Chester goal. With Millington now the regular in goal and youngster Phil Harrington emerging from the youth ranks, Lloyd was allowed to join Port Vale on loan in February 1981. He played Vale's remaining sixteen matches of the season. Vale supporters and players alike appealed to manager John McGrath to sign him on permanently at Vale Park, but to no avail, he returned to Sealand Road and was subsequently released.

Ahead of the start of the following season Lloyd was back at Stockport County, who were now managed by Jimmy McGuigan. He missed just one game in two seasons back at Edgeley Park, and even managed to get on the scoresheet against Bradford City in 1982. County hovered above the Fourth Division re-election zone in 1981–82 and 1982–83 under the stewardship of Eric Webster. Lloyd dropped into non-league football, having spells with North Wales sides Bangor City (Alliance Premier League and Northern Premier League), Colwyn Bay (North West Counties League), Rhyl and Lex XI.

Lloyd was capped three times by Wales in matches against Austria, England and Scotland, having twice previously played for the Welsh under 23s.

After retiring as a footballer, Lloyd became a self-employed design consultant in Wrexham, a career he had initially begun after leaving school. He has won awards for his architectural work.

In 1989, he returned to the second tier with FC Martigues and helped them to the Ligue 2 title and promotion to Ligue 1 in 1992–93. The club consolidated their top-flight status in 1993–94 and 1994–95, in part due to Didier Tholot's 13 league goals in both seasons. Pounewatchy spent the 1995–96 season with FC Gueugnon, though both Gueugnon and Martigues suffered relegation to Ligue 2.

Pounewatchy moved to England for the start of the 1996–97 season where he was a permanent fixture in the Third Division Carlisle United team in both 1996–97 and 1997–98.

He was named as man of the match as Carlisle won the 1997 Football League Trophy Final at Wembley with a penalty shoot-out victory over Colchester United following a 0–0 draw.

Pounewatchy then briefly moved north to Scotland for the 1997–98 season, spending August with Dundee in the SPL, playing four games before joining Port Vale of the English Football League First Division on a monthly basis. He was only at Vale Park for September, playing just two games. On 20 February, he joined Colchester United, signing a contract to run for the rest of the season. He said: "I am very happy to be in the Second Division because when you are a professional footballer you want to play at the highest level you can." He played fifteen games that season and was released on 8 May.

On 25 January 2000, he turned out for Scunthorpe United in a 2–1 defeat by Chesterfield at Glanford Park in the Football League Trophy.

Stan Cummins

Stan Cummins (born 6 December 1958 in Sedgefield, County Durham, England) was an English footballer who played as an attacking midfielder or forward.

In 1970, Cummins, at age 11, was spotted by Middlesbrough Chief Scout Ray Grant playing for Ferryhill Grammar School. Some of Grant's other discoveries were Brian Clough, Mark Proctor, and Tony Mowbray. Grant told Boro's Assistant Manager, Harold Shepherdson, that Cummins had the keenest football brain he had encountered in a boy, and was the most naturally-talented player he had seen since Hughie Gallacher. Shepherdson signed Cummins on Associate Schoolboy Forms for Middlesbrough at age 14, staving off competition from Chelsea, Arsenal, and Aston Villa, to name a few clubs wanting his signature. Grant died on 6 February 2006. Cummins played for the Spennymoor & District Schools Football Association under-14 team for the 1972–73 season, and for the Durham County Schools Football Association under-15 team for the 1973–74 season. He had try-outs for the England Schoolboys' Under-15 team, and was one of the best players on view, but was not selected. Manager Jim Morrow decided that Cummins was too small, and would not have the stamina to compete against the German Schoolboys' under-15 team at Wembley Stadium. Instead, he went to the game on a School trip, and watched it from the terraces, believing that he was good enough to be taking part. That made Cummins more determined than ever to become a Professional Footballer, and prove the doubters wrong.

Cummins began his career with Middlesbrough in 1975 as an apprentice professional, and was coached at youth level by George Wardle, and then by former Scotland and Celtic great Bobby Murdoch. He was voted Boro's Young Player of the Year in 1976. Manager Jack Charlton gave him his debut in the old First Division (now the Premier League) against Ipswich Town at Ayresome Park on 27 November 1976 at the age of only 17, and Cummins went on to become a firm crowd favourite. He played for Boro in a friendly match against Scottish club Hearts a few weeks earlier, and scored in a 3–0 win. Cummins signed professional forms with the club on his 18th birthday. He gained renown as a diminutive, skilful striker/midfielder. While still only a teenager, Jack Charlton suggested that Cummins would one day be the first player to be sold for one million pounds. However, that was not to be the case, for in 1979 Trevor Francis became the first when Nottingham Forest bought him from Birmingham City. In 1977, Cummins had the honour of playing with 1966 World Cup Winner Sir Bobby Charlton in John Hickton's Testimonial Match against Sunderland at Ayresome Park. In the summer of 1977 he played in the North American Soccer League (NASL) at the age of 18 for the Minnesota Kicks against the likes of Pelé, Franz Beckenbauer, Giorgio Chinaglia, and his idol George Best, winning the Western Division Championship. In November of '77, Cummins scored his first league goal in Boro's 1–0 win against Aston Villa at Villa Park. By age 19, he established himself in Boro's first team, and played in their F.A. Cup run of 1978 that took them to the semi-final draw for the first time in their one-hundred-and-two-year history. It was Ipswich Town v. West Bromwich Albion, and Arsenal v. Middlesbrough or Leyton Orient. In the quarter-final, Boro drew 0-0 with Orient at Ayresome Park, then lost the replay 2-1 at Brisbane Road. In January of that year, Boro beat Newcastle United 4–2 at St. James' Park, and Cummins scored Boro's fourth goal, prompting match commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme to say another of his famous one-liners. Immediately after the goal, Wolstenholme said, "That gives him (Cummins) ten out of ten, and one for neatness". Cummins played against Scotland in Willie Maddren's Testimonial Match prior to their departure for the 1978 World Cup in Argentina. Former Boro colleague Graeme Souness also played. Cummins was voted Boro's Player of the Year, and received his award from Vice Chairman Mike McCullagh. In December '78, Middlesbrough beat Chelsea 7-2 at Ayresome Park, and Cummins had three assists. In February 1979, he was a member of the England U21 Squad versus Wales U21 along with Bryan Robson, Glenn Hoddle, Kenny Sansom, and Terry Butcher, coached by Dave Sexton and Terry Venables. He also used to write a weekly column for "Scoop", a soccer magazine, as did Kenny Dalglish, Glenn Hoddle, and Peter Barnes.

Cummins joined Sunderland in November 1979 at the age of 20, for £300,000, the Club's most expensive signing in their 100-year history, scoring on his debut in the 3–1 win over Notts. County at Roker Park. He also won the "Daily Express" National Five-a-side Championship at Wembley Arena that same month. Cummins would also score vital goals for Sunderland in their promotion season of 1979–80. On 9 February 1980 he scored four goals and had one assist in the 5–0 win against Burnley at Roker Park. On 5 April he scored the only goal that beat Newcastle United in the local derby at Roker Park. That record stood for twenty-eight years until Sunderland beat Newcastle United again on home soil on 25 October 2008 when Sunderland won 2–1. He also scored in the 2–0 win against West Ham United to clinch promotion in front of 47,000 fans at Roker Park on 12 May. The following season, he would score the goal which ensured Sunderland's First Division survival away to Liverpool at Anfield in the last game of the season. He was named Sunderland Player of the Year for 1981 and also the North-East of England Outfield Player of the Year for 1981. He was also the only Sunderland player to play in all 46 League and Cup games that season. In the summer of 1981 he returned to the NASL and played for the Seattle Sounders alongside Bruce Rioch and Alan Hudson, winning the Trans-Atlantic Challenge Cup against the New York Cosmos, Glasgow Celtic and Southampton. He also played for the Sounders against the Washington Diplomats featuring Dutch legend Johan Cruyff. In May 1982 Aston Villa won the European Cup beating Bayern Munich 1-0. Three months later in the first fixture of the 1982/83 season Sunderland beat Aston Villa 3-1 at Villa Park, Cummins had two assists and was voted 'Man of the Match'.

In 1983, after his Sunderland contract had expired, Cummins joined Crystal Palace instead of Newcastle United and Kevin Keegan, a move he deeply regrets, returning to Sunderland a year later. He had played with Keegan in John Craggs's Testimonial Match in 1982 and enjoyed Keegan's style of play. His second spell at Roker Park was short-lived. He was a member of the Sunderland Squad who got to the 1985 League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium but couldn't play because he was cup-tied. In May 1985 he captained Sunderland to victory over Middlesbrough in the Final of the Bradford City Disaster Fund North East of England Six-a-Side Tournament held at Teesside Park. All of the proceeds went to Bradford City F.C. In all he made 165 appearances for Sunderland. He left the club following relegation in 1985 for the US at the age of 26 and joined the Minnesota Strikers on a three-year contract in the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). The Strikers reached the 1986 MISL Championship only to lose 4 games to 3 (best of seven) to the San Diego Sockers. However, they were crowned MISL Eastern Division Champions in 1988 and on 8 April Cummins scored a hat-trick in the Strikers 4–2 victory against the Chicago Sting and he was carried shoulder high from the playing field by his teammates at the end of the game. The club folded at the end of the season and so Cummins joined the Kansas City Comets for the 1988/89 season. He played in all of the Comets games that season along with teammate Greg Ion. An entertaining and skilful player, Cummins' career spanned 14 years, 10 years in the English Football League where he made 251 appearances in both League and Cup Competitions scoring 50 goals, 2 seasons in the NASL and 4 years in the MISL, USA. He retired as a professional player in 1990 and has a UEFA 'B' coaching certificate.

Jeff Johnson (footballer)

Jeffrey David Johnson (born 26 November 1953) is a Welsh former footballer. In addition to his club career – playing over 400 games in the Football League, he also represented his country at youth and under-23 level.

He began his career at Manchester City in 1970, and played on loan at Swansea City in 1972, before joining Crystal Palace the following year. He moved on to Sheffield Wednesday in 1976, and was voted Player of the Year in 1980, and helped the club to win promotion out of the Third Division in 1979–80. He signed with Newport County in 1981, before moving on to Gillingham the next year. He joined Port Vale in June 1985, and played a minor role in the club's promotion out of the Fourth Division, before he joined non-league Barrow in May 1986.

Johnson started his professional career with Manchester City in 1970, when Joe Mercer was finishing his six-year reign. He made six First Division appearances in 1970–71, 1971–72 and 1972–73. He also had a lengthy spell on loan at Swansea City, playing 38 games in the Third Division. In December 1973, Johnson rejoined his former Manchester City manager, Malcolm Allison, at Crystal Palace, but suffered relegation from the Second Division in 1973–74. Palace were four points off the promotion places in 1974–75 and three points shy of the promotion places in 1975–76, although Palace reached the FA Cup semi-final that year. Johnson made 26 league appearances that season and played in four out of eight games in the cup run. Johnson left Selhurst Park in July 1976, and moved on to Len Ashurst's Sheffield Wednesday, who finished six points behind Palace in 1976–77, who occupied the third and final promotion place. Jack Charlton then took over at Hillsborough, and Wednesday dropped to 14th in 1977–78 and 1978–79. Johnson was voted the club's Player of the Year in 1979–80, as Wednesday won promotion in third place. The club adapted comfortably to the Second Division in 1980–81, though at the end of the season, Johnson dropped back down a division to sign with Newport County, and was reunited with Len Ashurst at Somerton Park. Newport posted a 16th-place finish in 1981–82.

He then moved on to Keith Peacock's Gillingham, and became a key first team player at Priestfield Stadium. Gillingham finished 13th in the Third Division in 1982–83 and eighth in 1983–84, before missing out on the promotion places by one place and four points in 1984–85. He joined John Rudge's Port Vale in June 1985, making his debut on 17 August 1985 in a 1–0 defeat at Exeter City. He suffered a setback in October 1985 when he broke his foot. Unable to regain his first team spot with Port Vale, who went on to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1985–86, he was given a free transfer in May 1986, to Northern Premier League club Barrow. After leaving the game he spent many years as a taxi driver in Manchester.

Alex Neil (footballer)

Alexander Francis Neil (born 9 June 1981) is a Scottish professional football manager and former player who played as a midfielder. He is the manager of club Preston North End.

Neil began his professional career at Airdrieonians in 2000, playing half a season in the Scottish Football League First Division before moving to Barnsley. He played 142 games across all competitions in his four-year spell at Barnsley, and then signed for Mansfield Town on a free transfer. After a season at Mansfield, he returned to Scotland's First Division with Hamilton Academical, featuring in 246 matches across a decade and winning promotion to the Scottish Premier League in 2008.

He became Hamilton's player-manager in 2013 and led them to promotion to the Scottish Premiership in 2014. In January 2015 he was appointed manager of Norwich City, as the second youngest manager in the Football League at the time. Neil guided Norwich to promotion to the Premier League, after winning the 2015 Football League Championship play-off Final. But the team suffered relegation following the very next season, and on 10 March 2017, Neil was sacked from his role as Norwich City manager following a period of poor results. He was appointed by Preston North End on 4 July 2017 and led the team to seventh place in the 2017–18 Championship.

Born in Bellshill, North Lanarkshire, Neil began his career at Dunfermline Athletic, before joining Airdrieonians on a free transfer in the summer of 1999. He made his professional debut in the Scottish Football League First Division on 3 January 2000, as a 64th-minute substitute for Steve McCormick in a 0–2 home loss to Falkirk. Five days later, on his first start, he scored in the eighth minute of a 3–1 loss at St Mirren. He finished his first season with 5 goals from 16 appearances, with the other four scored in three consecutive games in April, including two in a 3–0 home win over Greenock Morton on the 8th.

After his first professional season, Neil was recommended to Barnsley by his next-door neighbour Peter Hetherston, a friend of their manager Dave Bassett. He made his debut for the Tykes in the Football League First Division on 26 August 2000, replacing Lee Jones for the final ten minutes of a 4–1 home win over West Bromwich Albion. He made 32 league appearances in his first season at Oakwell, and was sent off on 28 April 2001 in a 0–1 home loss to Bolton Wanderers.

On 15 September 2001, Neil scored his first goal in English football, concluding a 2–0 home win over Crewe Alexandra. He netted again on 8 November in a 2–2 draw at Preston North End, in a campaign which ended in relegation. Neil spent the following two seasons in the Second Division, scoring the decisive goals in 3–2 wins at Rushden & Diamonds and Stockport County on 10 April and 8 May 2004.

On 20 July 2004, Neil joined Mansfield Town on a free transfer. He made 41 appearances for them in League Two that season, and scored his first goal on 23 November in the first round of the FA Cup, a consolation in a 4–1 loss to Colchester United at Layer Road. His only league goal for the Stags came on 5 March 2005, opening a 1–1 draw against Shrewsbury Town at Field Mill.

On 28 May 2005, having been told that he was surplus to the requirements of Mansfield manager Carlton Palmer, Neil returned to the Scottish First Division, signing a two-year deal at Hamilton Academical. He made his Accies debut on 13 August, as they began the season with a 0–1 loss to St Johnstone at New Douglas Park. Seventeen days later, he scored his first goal for his new team in the second round of the Scottish Challenge Cup, netting the only goal away to Ross County when he headed in Brian Carrigan's cross just before half time. On 22 October, he got his first league goal for them, in the first minute of the second half of a 3–0 home win against Brechin City. Neil played the entirety of the 2005 Scottish Challenge Cup Final on 6 November, a 2–1 loss to St Mirren at the Excelsior Stadium in Airdrie. The Accies also reached the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup, with Neil scoring a penalty kick in the fourth round replay at Alloa Athletic, a 3–0 win.

Neil played 30 league games in 2007–08, as Hamilton won the division and promotion to the Scottish Premier League. He scored once that season, opening a 4–0 home win over Stirling Albion on 15 September 2007 with a 40-yard free kick.

On 6 May 2011, Neil signed a new three-year contract.

After manager Billy Reid vacated his managerial position at Hamilton in April 2013, Neil (who had already been involved in coaching the club's youth teams) was appointed player-manager on an interim basis. He was made manager on a permanent basis on 24 May 2013, at the age of 31. Assisted by Frankie McAvoy, Neil led the club to promotion back to the top flight in his first full season, winning through the play-off system in May 2014. Hamilton then enjoyed a good start to the 2014–15 Scottish Premiership, defeating Celtic away for the first time in 76 years.

In January 2015, Neil obtained permission from Hamilton to speak to Norwich City about their managerial vacancy. On 9 January, he was confirmed as their new manager at 33 years old, the second youngest in the Football League after Mansfield's Adam Murray. The following day in his first game, he managed his team to a 2–1 victory at Championship leaders AFC Bournemouth. Norwich gained 17 wins from 25 games played under Neil in the 2014–15 season. They finished third in the Championship and entered the play-offs, where in the semi-finals they beat East Anglia derby rivals Ipswich Town 4–2 on aggregate over two legs. On 25 May, Neil led Norwich to a 2–0 victory over Middlesbrough in the 2015 Football League Championship play-off Final, as goalscorers Cameron Jerome and Nathan Redmond secured promotion to the 2015–16 Premier League. During the 2015 close season, Neil signed a new contract with Norwich City.

However, Norwich were relegated after a single season in the Premier League. Neil had his contract terminated in March 2017, with the Canaries 8th in the table. They had won seven of their last 24 games in The Championship and were nine points outside the top six play-off places. Neil admitted to regret over summer recruitment, which led to his sacking in March.

On 4 July 2017, Neil was appointed as manager of Championship club Preston North End, replacing former manager Simon Grayson, who left the club to take over as manager of Sunderland.

A one-club man, Parry remained at The Baseball Ground for 20 years and set a club record 482 League appearances in the 1965/66 season (517 in total) until Kevin Hector overtook it. Parry is also the Rams ninth highest goalscorer in all competitions with 110 goals, and fifth highest League goalscorer (105 goals).

An inside forward, Parry made his debut aged 17, and scored, in a 2–2 draw at home to Aston Villa in April 1949. He played sporadically until the last four games of the 1950/51 season and was leading scorer in 1951/52 with 11 goals in 28 League games. Parry's best scoring season was 24 goals in 34 League games in 1955/56 but was injured by Ray de Gruchy's challenge playing Grimsby Town at The Baseball Ground in March 1956. The back injury sustained in the game meant Parry was sidelined for the rest of the season and without his goals, Grimsby went on to win the Third Division North and take the only promotion place. The injury limited Parry's contribution the following season and he made 18 appearances, scoring seven goals, as Derby won the title. In the Second Division Parry became club captain and converted to wing-half but eventually lost his place in the 1965/66 season before moving on to Boston United.

Parry was a popular member of the dressing room. One well-known tale is when trainer Ralph Hann was treating him in a match for suspected concussion. Hann asked Parry where he was. "I'm at Wembley" said Parry. "We're beating Brazil 2-0 - and I've scored both."

His four brothers were also footballers: Cyril played for Notts County, Ray for Bolton Wanderers and England, and Reg and Glynn, who both played in non-league.

After scoring only three goals in 16 appearances, he left the club by mutual consent on 28 June 2010. Although he was a target for Rushden & Diamonds, he rejoined Crawley Town a day after leaving Oxford. On 31 May 2011, he signed for Bath City.

Bryn Jones (footballer, born 1939)

Bryn Jones (born 26 May 1939, Bagillt, Flintshire) was a Welsh professional footballer who played as a full back. He played in The Football League for Watford and Chester.

Jones (aka bb) played for non-league side Holywell Town until joining Division Three side Watford in January 1963. However, he made just two league appearances before he returned north by joining Chester in August 1964. He made his Chester debut during the same month in a 3–1 win at Bradford City but added just one more appearance during the season. The following campaign saw him emerging as a regular at left back, with namesake Ray Jones playing in the right back slot. Chester went into their home game against Aldershot on 1 January 1966 in second place in Division Four, but both Bryn and Ray suffered broken legs in the 3–2 victory. The pair missed the remainder of the season as Chester finished in seventh place.

Jones recovered to play 11 games the following season before dropping out of The Football League and joining New Brighton.

Ross Jack

James Ross Jack (born 21 March 1959) is a Scottish football player and manager.

A striker, Jack began his career with Ross County, where he played in the Highland Football League at the age of 14. He then joined Everton, initially as an apprentice before graduating to the professional ranks. He made only a solitary, goalscoring appearance, for Everton and, after a loan spell at Cardiff City, he joined Norwich City for £20,000 in December 1979. He would have to wait almost a year before making his Norwich debut against Ipswich Town in the League Cup in September 1980. In the 1981–82 season, he scored 10 league goals for Norwich and, with two in the FA Cup and two more in the Football League Cup, was the club's leading scorer for the season. In the summer of 1983, a fee of £15,000 secured his transfer to Lincoln City where he remained for the next two seasons. His last game for Lincoln, and in England, was in May 1985, against Bradford City, in a game overshadowed by the Bradford City stadium fire, which killed 56 spectators. 
In July 1985, he returned to Scotland to join Dundee. In October 1987, Dunfermline Athletic's manager Jim Leishman paid £15,000 to secure Jack's services and he made an instant impression, scoring on his debut in a 3–2 away defeat to Motherwell. In each of his three seasons at the club, Jack would finish as Dunfermline's leading scorer, his most successful season being the 1989–1990 campaign when he was the second highest goalscorer in the Scottish Premier League, his 16 league goals placing him just one goal behind John Robertson. In July 1991 a fee of £45,000 was sufficient to see Jack move to Kilmarnock. Following a brief loan to Sligo Rovers (January – March 1993), Jack was appointed player-manager of Montrose in March 1993. His spell would last only six months and in October 1993 he moved on to Ayr United before retiring from the professional game at the end of the 1993–1994 season.

Post retirement, Jack moved into coaching, primarily focusing with work with the Scottish Football Association (SFA), first as the SFA's Highlands and Islands area community development officer and then as the SFA's North of Scotland Football Development Officer. In October 2001 it was announced that he would leave this role to take up the position of High Performance Football Coach at the Scottish Institute of Sport, a role he commenced in December 2001 and maintains to this day. On his appointment, Jack was quoted as saying "this new role is one where I hope we can make a difference to the future prospects of Scottish football." He continued to play football at a junior level, particularly in the North Caledonian Football League with Alness United and, in the summer months, with hometown Avoch.
In October 2007 there was speculation that Jack may make a return to management with Ross County with The Scotsman quoting Jack as saying "the time could be right for me to get back into the game. I could think of no better club than Ross County to do that with. I'm a local boy and County have played a big part in my life." but the return did not materialise. In April 2008, his post as the Scottish Institute of Sport's high-performance football coach was axed after the Scottish FA decided that the coaching of young players was best done by the individual clubs. Jack finally made his return to Ross County when he was appointed assistant coach in July 2008. In December 2008 Ross lost his job with Ross County due to the managerial team wanting to take a "new direction".

In January 2009, Jack was appointed manager of Elgin City in the Scottish Third Division. After five years with the club, Jack left Elgin City in January 2014 by mutual consent.

On 23 April 2014, Jack was appointed manager of Turriff United a Scottish Highland Football League club from Aberdeenshire.

Colin West

Colin West (born 13 November 1962) is an English former footballer who played as a forward, and now works assistant manager to Keith Curle at Northampton Town. In all he scored 158 goals in 555 league games in the English Football League, Conference and the Scottish Football League.

He began his career at Sunderland in 1981, playing more than 100 games for the "Black Cats" before moving on to Watford in March 1985. He was sold on to Rangers the following year for £180,000, though made only occasional appearances as Rangers won the Scottish Football League Premier Division title during the 1986–87 season. He returned to England with Sheffield Wednesday in September 1987 for a fee of £150,000. Two years later he signed with West Bromwich Albion, before he joined Swansea City in August 1992, following a loan spell at Port Vale. He moved on to Leyton Orient in July 1993 and spent five years at the club. In 1997, he was loaned out to Northampton Town, before he switched clubs to Conference club Rushden & Diamonds. The next year he signed with Northwich Victoria, before signing with Hartlepool United in 2000. After retiring in 2001, he spent the next ten years coaching at various clubs, including: Hartlepool United, Sheffield Wednesday, Stockport County, Millwall, Southend United, Notts County, Carlisle United and Northampton Town. He served both Hartlepool United and Millwall as caretaker-manager.

West turned professional in July 1980, and made his debut for Sunderland on 20 April 1981 against West Bromwich Albion in a 2–1 defeat at The Hawthorns under caretaker-manager Mick Docherty. The club narrowly avoided relegation out of the First Division in 1981–82 under new boss Alan Durban, finishing just one place and two points above relegated Leeds United. They then finished four places and three points above the drop in 1982–83. West was the club's top scorer in 1983–84 with nine goals. The next season, he scored three goals over the two legs in the League Cup semi-final win over Chelsea, but was left out of the Wembley final by manager Len Ashurst. Following this snub he joined league rivals Watford for £115,000 in March 1985. The "Black Cats" went on to lose their top-flight status in 1984–85, finishing two places and ten points short of safety. He scored 28 goals in 122 competitive appearances for Sunderland.

He was the club's top scorer in 1985–86 with 16 goals. In total he hit 23 goals in 56 league and cup appearances for Graham Taylor's Watford, before he moved on to Scottish Premier Division club Rangers for a £200,000 fee in May 1986, then managed by Graeme Souness. He played 12 games at Ibrox in the title winning 1986–87 campaign, scoring three goals. He returned to England to sign with First Division side Sheffield Wednesday for £150,000 in September 1987. The club finished eleventh in 1987–88 under Howard Wilkinson's stewardship, before heading into a relegation dogfight under Peter Eustace in 1988–89. West made 57 league and cup appearances at Wednesday, scoring 13 goals.

He signed with Second Division side West Bromwich Albion in exchange for Carlton Palmer in February 1989, but was unable to fire Brian Talbot's side into the play-offs in 1988–89, as they ended up two places and four points short of their target. The "Baggies" dropped to 20th in 1989–90, and were just two places and three points above relegated Bournemouth. The 1990–91 season was a disaster, and West Brom were relegated into the Third Division for the first time in their history. Not highly rated at the Hawthorns, he made 73 league appearances, scoring 22 goals, during his stay in the West Midlands. He joined Second Division club Port Vale on loan in November 1991, making five appearances and scoring one goal for John Rudge's side.

He was signed by Swansea City manager Frank Burrows in August 1992, and scored two goals in his first start for the club in a 2–0 win over former side Port Vale. He went on to score 12 goals in 33 Second Division appearances, as the "Swans" reached the play-offs in 1992–93, only to be sent off for fouling Ian Hamilton during a 2–0 defeat by his former club West Bromwich Albion in the second leg of the semi-finals, which left Swansea with a 3–2 aggregate loss. West later said that "I instantly thought ‘why on earth did I do that?’ but the referee rightly sent me off. It was a very sad way for me to end my time with the club."

West switched to Second Division rivals Leyton Orient in July 1993, who were then by managed by his former boss Peter Eustace. The "O's" finished 18th in 1993–94, before being relegated in last place in 1994–95. The club struggled in the fourth tier, and posted a 21st-place finish in 1995–96 under Pat Holland, three positions above Torquay United, the English Football League's bottom club. He scored five goals in 26 appearances in 1996–97, as Orient moved up to 16th under Tommy Taylor's stewardship. In total he made 142 league appearances for Leyton Orient, scoring 42 goals. In September 1997, he joined Second Division side Northampton Town on loan, but made just two goalless appearances for Ian Atkins' "Cobblers". Two months later he was loaned out to Rushden & Diamonds of the Conference, in a move that reunited him with former manager Brian Talbot, and helped to fire the "Diamonds" to a fourth-place finish in 1997–98.

West signed with Rushden & Diamonds permanently for the 1998–99 season, and helped the club to another fourth-place finish. He moved on to Mark Gardiner's Conference strugglers Northwich Victoria in the 1999–2000 campaign, before ending his career at Hartlepool United, where he made just a single appearance in 1999–2000.

West was a forward who was "powerful in the air and determined on the ground".

When West joined Hartlepool United in November 1999 he was appointed as assistant manager to Chris Turner. The pair helped the club avoid falling into the Conference when they arrived, before they led the club to three successive Third Division play-offs, though they never made it past the semi-finals. When Turner left the club to take over as manager of Sheffield Wednesday in November 2002, West briefly took charge of the first team on a caretaker basis. After a win and a draw, West left to team up with Turner at Hillsborough, and later followed him to Stockport County, before the pair left Edgeley Park in December 2005.

He then spent time as reserve team coach at Millwall, being appointed assistant caretaker-manager to Richard Shaw after Willie Donachie was dismissed. He later took up the reserve team coaching position at Southend United in December 2008. Three months later, with Turner back in charge at "Pools" on a caretaker basis, West left the position at Southend to return to Hartlepool as assistant coach. He left Hartlepool again in June 2010 after the club chose not to renew his contract. In February 2012, Notts County manager Keith Curle recruited West to work as a coach. He left the club a year later, when Curle was sacked. He was appointed assistant manager at Carlisle United when Curle took charge of the club in September 2014. The pair left Brunton Park at the end of the 2017–18 season. On 1 October 2018, Curle was appointed as Northampton Town, and again hired West as his assistant.

David Howland

David Howland (born 17 September 1986) is a Northern Irish former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He scored 17 goals in 171 league a cup appearances in an eleven-year career in professional and semi-professional football in England and Northern Ireland.

A Northern Ireland under-21 international, he started his career at Birmingham City. In January 2008, he was loaned out to Port Vale, and joined the club on a permanent basis at the end of the season. He was released by Port Vale in the summer of 2010, at which point he signed with Glentoran. He helped the club to win the Irish Cup in 2013, before he retired due to injury in August 2016.

Howland was born in Ballynahinch, County Down, and joined Birmingham City's Academy in 2002. He signed his first one-year professional contract in 2005, which was renewed for a further year. He was allocated a first-team squad number for the first time during the 2006–07 season, and signed a further year's contract before the 2007–08 season. A central midfielder, he played regularly for Birmingham's reserve team but did not make an appearance for the first team.

He was an unused substitute in the League Cup fourth round tie against Blackburn Rovers in September 2007 in unusual circumstances. Birmingham had selected the 15-year-old Jordon Mutch, having obtained confirmation from the Premier League that it was within the rules for a boy of that age to play, but were informed less than two hours before kick-off that due to the Football Association's child protection rules Mutch would not be eligible. Special dispensation was granted for Howland, who had not been assigned a squad number for the 2007–08 season, to take his place on the bench wearing a numberless shirt.

In January 2008 he joined Port Vale of League One on loan for the remainder of the season, and made his debut in the Football League on 26 January 2008 against A.F.C. Bournemouth.
At the end of the season he was released by Birmingham, but his performance while on loan at Port Vale was sufficient to earn him a two-year permanent deal.

He was one of few Vale players to hit 40 games in the 2008–09 season. He enjoyed his time under Dean Glover, especially in games with Glover's five-man midfield tactic. However, he was transfer listed by new manager Micky Adams in August 2009, along with five others, having failed to impress in the pre-season. After a month on the transfer list, he was the only one of the six to have received no inquiries from any clubs, which came as a surprise to many Vale fans. He returned to the Vale first team in mid-September, after impressing in training, though he remained transfer listed. In April 2010 he learned that he would not be offered a new contract by manager Micky Adams.

In September 2010, Howland left England for Belfast, signing a season long contract with IFA Premiership club Glentoran. He made his debut in the televised Sky Sports match at home to Linfield. He was utilised in the playmaker role in the heart of the midfield. The "Glens" finished in third place in 2010–11, qualifying for the UEFA Europa League. In January 2011, he signed a contract to keep him at the club until 2014. Glentoran then finished sixth in 2011–12. They finished fourth in 2012–13, and qualified for the Europa League. Glentoran also won the Irish Cup, and Howland played in the 3–1 final victory over Cliftonville. Howland also featured in the club's Europa League qualification defeat to Icelandic club KR. The "Glens" finished the 2013–14 season in fifth place, though Howland missed much of the campaign after injuring cartilage in his knee. He featured ten times in the 2014–15 campaign, and just once in the 2015–16 season, before he announced his retirement in August 2016, owing to a long-standing injury.

Howland represented Northern Ireland at junior levels and was first selected for the under-21 squad in February 2006. He won four caps at under-21 level.

Howland graduated as a physiotherapist, and secured a job at the Crewe Alexandra Academy in 2016.

John A. "Jack" Savage (14 December 1929 - January 2009) was an English former football goalkeeper who played for Hull City, Halifax Town, Manchester City, Walsall and Wigan Athletic.

Savage was signed by Manchester City in November 1953, where he deputised for Bert Trautmann. He was at the club for more than a year before making his debut, a 2–0 defeat to Newcastle United on 27 December 1954. He also played in the next game against Burnley, but once Trautmann recovered from injury Savage returned to the reserves. His next chance came in April 1956, when he again replaced Trautmann for two matches. Trautmann broke his neck in the 1956 FA Cup Final, giving Savage the opportunity of an extended run in the first team during the 1956–57 season.

He was transferred to Walsall in January 1958 for £4,000. In one of his early games for Walsall, an away match at Swindon, he was sent off. He made 51 appearances for Walsall, moving to non-league Wigan in 1959. He spent one season at the club, appearing four times for the club in the Lancashire Combination.

Chris Dangerfield

Christopher George Dangerfield (born 9 August 1955) is an English former footballer who spent most of his career in the United States.

He began his career in England before playing ten seasons in the North American Soccer League and at least one in the Western Soccer Alliance. A former England under-20 international, he played for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Portland Timbers, Port Vale, Las Vegas Quicksilvers, Team Hawaii, Tulsa Roughnecks, California Surf, Los Angeles Aztecs, San Jose Earthquakes / Golden Bay Earthquakes, Minnesota Strikers, and San Jose Oaks.

Dangerfield grew up in Sutton Coldfield and attended John Willmott School. Preferring rugby as a youth, he began playing football around fourteen. In 1972, he began his career with Wolverhampton Wanderers, but made no first-team appearances. In 1975, he went on loan with the expansion Portland Timbers of the North American Soccer League, and scored four goals in 14 games in the 1975 season. Timbers reached Soccer Bowl '75, losing 2–0 to the Tampa Bay Rowdies at the Spartan Stadium. He was kept on by manager Vic Crowe for the 1976 season, scoring another two goals in 22 appearances. He was then released from his contract at Molineux by Wolves boss Bill McGarry. He returned to England to have a trial with Port Vale in August 1976, but only made two substitute appearances at Vale Park in the Third Division for Roy Sproson's "Valiants". He then signed with Coventry City, where he spent the entire 1976–77 season with the team's reserves in The Central League and then turned down a new contract offer from manager Jimmy Hill to search for first team football elsewhere.

In 1977, he moved permanently to the United States, and signed with Derek Trevis's Las Vegas Quicksilvers, who boasted the legendary Eusébio on their playing staff. Dangerfield scored two goals in 16 games in the 1977 season. He was traded to Team Hawaii, playing six games. At the end of the season both Quicksilvers and Team Hawaii were disbanded. In 1978, he began the season with the Tulsa Roughnecks, but saw time in only one game before being sent to the California Surf, where he made 22 appearances. In 1979, he signed with the Los Angeles Aztecs, scoring nine goals in 22 games in his first season at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. He then scored 15 goals in 12 games in the 1979–80 Indoor season. He scored two goals in 19 games in the 1980 season, before hitting 35 goals in 16 matches in the 1980–81 Indoor season. He scored eight goals in 30 appearances in the 1981 season.

Dangerfield moved to the San Jose Earthquakes in 1982, and scored 16 goals in 15 games in the 1981–82 Indoor season and then nine goals in 30 appearances in the 1982 season. At the end of the 1982 season, the Earthquakes were renamed the Golden Bay Earthquakes. They entered the Major Indoor Soccer League for the winter indoor season. Dangerfield was the 15th leading scorer with 48 games, 52 goals, 20 assists, and 72 points. The Earthquakes returned to the NASL for the 1983 outdoor seasons. Dangerfield injured his knee during the 1983–84 NASL indoor season and lost the entire 1984 outdoor season. In February 1985, the Kansas City Comets of the Major Indoor Soccer League made an offer to purchase Dangerfield's contract from the Earthquakes, but the deal fell through when Dangerfield was unable to pass a physical.

In March 1985, he signed as a free agent with the Minnesota Strikers of the MISL. He scored four goals in seven games in 1984–85, 24 goals in 47 games in 1985–86, 20 goals in 49 appearances in 1986–87, and hit 12 goals in 52 matches in the 1987–88 season. In June 1985, he returned to the renamed San Jose Earthquakes for the Western Soccer Alliance. He played one more season, 1988, for the Earthquakes in the Western Soccer Alliance after which he retired from playing professionally. However, he continued to play for the San Jose Oaks, eventually also becoming the team's coach.

In 1992, he became the coach of the amateur San Jose Oaks, taking them to the 1992 U.S. Open Cup title. He remained in that position until 1996.

He holds a USSF "National-A" coaching license and has coached for the De Anza Soccer Club of Cupertino, Saratoga, West San Jose, area of California, and has worked as the head coach of teams in the US Soccer Development Academy League until the end of the 2011 season.

Ray Jones (footballer, born 1944)

Ray Jones (4 June 1944 – July 2007) was an English professional footballer who played as a full back. He was born and died in Chester, made 170 Football League appearances for Chester, and also played and managed in non-league football.

Jones joined Chester as a schoolboy, making his first-team debut in a 1–0 win over Hartlepool United on 7 December 1962 in the number 2 shirt. By the 1964–65 season Jones was a regular in the side, performing well when asked to mark George Best in an FA Cup tie against Manchester United in January 1965.

Unfortunately, Jones and his namesake and fellow full-back Bryn Jones suffered fractured legs in a match against Aldershot twelve months later. The pair missed the remainder of the season as Chester fell out of promotion contention, with Ray not returning to action until October. He remained at the club until the end of the 1968–69 season, with his final game being a 1–0 home defeat to Exeter City on 19 April 1969.

That was to be the last Football League match played by Jones, as he joined non–league side Runcorn. He followed it up by playing for Oswestry Town, Bethesda Athletic and Colwyn Bay, where he became player–manager. He went on to have spells as manager of Rhyl, where he achieved three promotions, and Connah's Quay Nomads. Away from football he worked as an engineer.

Jones died in July 2007 at the Hospice of the Good Shepherd near Chester.

Enrique Sola

Enrique "Kike" Sola Clemente (; born 25 February 1986) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a striker.

During a 13-year professional career, he amassed La Liga totals of 106 matches and 22 goals over nine seasons, representing Osasuna and Athletic Bilbao in the competition.

Sola was born in Cascante, Navarre. A product of CA Osasuna's youth system, he made his first-team and La Liga debut on 9 June 2007, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 5–0 away win against Real Betis and scoring twice.

On 16 July 2009, after having appeared rarely in the previous two seasons (also struggling with injuries and loss of form), Sola moved to Segunda División's CD Numancia on a season-long loan, as part of a deal that saw Carlos Aranda move in the opposite direction, permanently. On 18 January of the following year, after a negative experience – even when healthy, he did not make the list of 18 on several occasions – he terminated his contract with the Soria club and moved abroad, joining Levadiakos F.C. from Greece until June.

For the 2010–11 campaign, Sola was initially only fourth-choice behind Aranda, Walter Pandiani and newly signed Dejan Lekić, only starting to receive significant playing time after injuries to the first two. On 13 March 2011, in one of his first starts, he netted in a 3–1 home win against Racing de Santander, and added another in the following matchday, scoring from a backheel in a 4–0 win at Hércules CF.

Osasuna eventually escaped relegation, and Sola finished as the team's top scorer even though he featured in less than half of the matches. On 11 May 2011 he helped with a brace to a 3–2 home win against Sevilla FC, after his side trailed 0–2 at half-time.

Sola only played in seven scoreless games in 2011–12, being troubled by tendinitis problems for several months and eventually undergoing surgery in early March 2012, being sidelined until June. On 25 February 2013, the day of his 27th birthday, he played just 20 minutes after coming from the bench away against Levante UD, but netted the second goal in an eventual 2–0 triumph for his seventh of the season.

On 31 March 2013, Sola helped with a brace as Osasuna came from behind to win it 3–1 over Real Valladolid at the "Estadio José Zorrilla".

In summer 2013, Sola joined Athletic Bilbao on a five-year contract with a €30 million buyout clause – he had already played youth football with the club, from ages 12–17. After spending four months recovering from injury he scored his first goal on 26 January 2014, closing the scoresheet in a 5–1 away win over former side Osasuna.

Sola played sparingly for the "Lions", remaining an unused substitute as they lost the 2015 final of the Copa del Rey to FC Barcelona. Against the same opponent, in that year's Supercopa de España, he came in the 80th minute of the second leg at the Camp Nou and, within seven minutes was given a red card for a foul on Javier Mascherano; his team nonetheless won 5–1 on aggregate for his first major honour.

In December 2015, Sola scored in each leg of Athletic's 8–0 aggregate win over Real Balompédica Linense in the domestic cup. The following 15 January he moved abroad for a second time, joining English Football League Championship leaders Middlesbrough on a temporary basis until the end of the campaign and teaming up with several compatriots at the club, among them manager Aitor Karanka. His first appearance occurred on 6 February, as he started and played the first half of the 1–1 home draw against Blackburn Rovers.

On 31 August 2016, Sola joined Getafe CF on a season-long loan. However, late into the following transfer window, that deal was cancelled and he moved to fellow second division side Numancia in another temporary deal.

During his four-year spell at the San Mamés Stadium, Sola was rarely used. On 1 June 2018, citing a "lack of motivation", the 32-year-old retired from football.

Sola won his first and only cap for the Spanish under-21 team on 25 March 2008, playing the second half of the 5–0 home defeat of Kazakhstan for the 2009 UEFA European Championship qualifiers after replacing Bojan Krkić.

Peter Zelem

Peter Zelem (born 13 February 1962, Manchester) is an English former professional footballer who played as a defender. He played in The Football League for four clubs during the 1980s.

Zelem began with Blackpool on schoolboy forms but was released and joined Chester as an apprentice. He made his debut in a 1–0 win over Carlisle United in August 1980, one of six first-team appearances he made during the 1980–81 season. His first goal arrived on the opening day of the following season against Bristol Rovers and he became a regular over the next few years. By the start of 1984–85 he was the longest serving player at Chester, but he moved midway through the season to Wolverhampton Wanderers for £12,500. Although this initially gave Zelem the chance to play in the Second Division, the club were rapidly sliding downwards and were in the Fourth Division by the time he linked up with former Chester manager John McGrath at Preston North End in March 1987. He had the distinction of scoring the first goal in the Fourth Division for Wolves, on 23 August 1986, in their 2–1 home defeat to Cambridge United on the opening day of the league season.

He helped Preston to promotion before joining Burnley in the summer of 1987. After an injury hit two years at Turf Moor, Zelem left the club and joined non-league side Winsford United. He then moved on to Ashton United, but injury forced him to retire from playing. Away from football he has worked as a contract cleaner with his twin brother Alan (a former goalkeeper with Macclesfield Town).

Zelem was the first post-war Football League player to have a surname beginning with a Z, first appearing the season before Romeo Zondervan joined Ipswich Town.

Martin Lane

Martin Lane (born 12 April 1961) is an English former footballer who played mainly as a full-back. Born in Altrincham, he made appearances in The Football League for four clubs, with most of his career being spent with Chester City.

Lane joined Manchester United as a youngster in 1977 and spent five years at Old Trafford without making a competitive first-team appearance. He joined Chester City in August 1982, making his debut in a Football League Trophy tie away at Chesterfield during the same month. He quickly became a regular in the side and even had a successful game as a makeshift centre-forward in Chester's 4–2 win at Tranmere Rovers in December 1982, scoring twice. Despite remaining a regular player, Lane had to wait until April 1986 for his next Chester goal, scoring direct from a corner kick in a 2–1 win over Exeter City to help the club move to the brink of promotion. During the same season, Lane was part of a defence that helped Chester go 423 minutes without conceding a goal.

After helping Chester to a 2–1 win over Wrexham in the FA Cup third round in January 1987, Lane moved to Division One side Coventry City for £25,000. After making just three league appearances in two years at Highfield Road and spending time on loan with Wrexham, Lane returned to Chester for the same amount he had been sold for in January 1989. His arrival was quickly followed by a run of four successive wins without conceding a goal, as Chester came close to qualifying for the Division Three play-offs. Lane remained a regular until the end of the 1990–91 season, playing his final game in a 1–0 defeat at Bolton Wanderers on 11 May 1991.

Lane made just 10 appearances in a season with Walsall and then dropped into non-league football, having spells with clubs including Shepshed Albion, Worcester City and Hinckley Town, while working for a security company.

Steve Johnson (English footballer)

Stephen Anthony Johnson (born 23 June 1957) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker. He played in the Football League for six different clubs and also played in non-league football and abroad.

Johnson played non-league football for Bangor City and Altrincham before being signed by Football League side Bury in November 1977. He spent six years at Gigg Lane and then had a relatively short spell with Rochdale before moving to Wigan Athletic in February 1984. 13 months later Johnson joined Bristol City for £40,000, but he could not settle in the area and returned north by rejoining Rochdale on loan and then reuniting with his former Wigan manager Harry McNally at Chester City in March 1986 in a further loan deal.

Johnson's aerial power was a welcome asset to Chester's attack and he scored six times in the final 10 games of the season to seal promotion from Division Four. Johnson then spent two years with Scunthorpe until he joined Chester on a permanent basis ahead of the 1988–89 season. He played regularly alongside Carl Dale in the Chester attack as they narrowly missed the Third Division play–offs. During his spell at Chester, his all action playing style earned him the nickname 'Mean Machine'. After spending the summer months playing in Scandinavia, Johnson joined Rochdale for a third time to bring the curtain down on his league career.

He later played for Limerick, where he made a scoring League of Ireland debut on 1 September 1990, and in October 1990 he made one league appearance for Cork City. He also played for non-league teams Northwich Victoria, Radcliffe Borough, Castleton Gabriels, Caernarfon Town and Haslingden, while working as a financial advisor.

Neal Trotman

Neal Anthony Trotman (born 11 March 1987) is an English former professional footballer who last played for Bristol Rovers. He played as a central defender.

Born in Levenshulme, Manchester, England, Trotman started his football career at Burnley and progressed through the club's youth system. He captained the club's youth side to reach the Alliance Cup final but lost. However, the following year, he was released by Burnley at the age of 18 and was soon picked up by Oldham Athletic.

After spending two months on the substitute bench in the first team, Trotman made his professional debut (and Oldham), coming on as a substitute for Stefan Stam in the second half, in a 2–1 win over Cheltenham Town on 4 November 2006. In his second appearance for the side, he scored his first goal for the club in an FA Cup tie against Kettering Town, in a 4–3 win. With his chances limited, he was sent out on loan to Halifax Town for the remainder of the 2006–07 season. By the time he joined Halifax Town on loan, Trotman made two appearances for the side and signed a new deal, keeping him until the end of the season.

Trotman made his Halifax Town debut on 23 January 2007 against York City, starting the whole game, in a 1–1 draw. He then scored three goals in three matches between 17 February 2007 and 24 February 2007, scoring against Stafford Rangers, Weymouth and Kidderminster Harriers. Trotman became a first team regular for Halifax Town until he suffered a hamstring injury that kept him out for six weeks. It wasn't until on 7 April 2007 when he made his return from injury, starting the whole game, in a 1–0 win over Cambridge United. At the end of the 2006–07 season, Trotman made twelve appearances and scoring two times for the side.

Trotman's chances at the beginning of the 2007–08 season were also limited until injuries hit the Latics' defence. Trotman then found himself in a string of first team matches, impressing the manager and the fans in the process. He was quickly hailed a "hot prospect" by the fans and became a first team regular for the side. Trotman then scored his first goal of the season, coming against Doncaster Rovers in the first round of the FA Cup, which saw both drew 2–2. However, in the first round of the FA Cup replay, he was sent–off for a second bookable offence, which saw Oldham Athletic win 2–1. Trotman then scored his second goal of the season against Leeds United in Oldham's 3–1 win at Elland Road; however, he missed their historic 1–0 win over Everton at Goodison Park due to suspension after accumulating five yellow cards. His good aerial ability matched by his athleticism, strength and sharpness attracted scouts from clubs in higher divisions. With interest growing in Trotman, Oldham faced a tough fight to keep hold of him during the transfer window. On 29 January, it had been confirmed that Plymouth Argyle had made an undisclosed fee; however that bid alerted numerous clubs who were tracking his progress to make a move, among those clubs were Preston North End, Derby County, and Blackburn Rovers.

Trotman signed for Preston North End on 30 January 2008 for a fee of £500,000 (including "sell on" and "after appearances" clauses) on a three-year deal.

After spending three months on the sidelined, he made his Preston North End debut, coming on as a substitute for Sean St Ledger midway through the first half, who suffered an injury, in a 2–2 draw against Plymouth Argyle on 19 April 2008. At the end of the 2007–08 season, Trotman made three appearances for the side.

However, in the 2008–09 season, Trotman suffered a hernia injury that kept him sidelined for the rest of the year. By mid–December, he made his return to training and played in the reserve side for several months before being loaned out. For the next two years, Trotman was put on the transfer list by Preston manager Darren Ferguson after returning from a loan spell at League One side Huddersfield Town.

At the end of the 2010–11 season, he was released by the club upon expiry of his contract. Trotman was ranked number five by local newspaper Lancashire Live as "the most bizarre signings in the history of Preston North End".

In order to get first team football, he signed a one-month loan deal with Colchester United on 19 March 2009 to gain match fitness. Trotman made his Colchester United debut on 21 March 2009, starting the whole game, in a 1–1 draw against Leicester City. During the match, he "dominated both boxes in the air, turning in a man-of-the-match display", resulting from praise by Manager Paul Lambert. Trotman went on to make six appearances for Colchester United.

At the start of the 2009–10 season, he made his first start of the Preston North End coming on as a 67-minute substitute and scoring in their 5–1 win over Morecambe in the first round of the League Cup. On 20 August 2009, Trotman joined Southampton on loan until January 2010, having rejected a move to Millwall. His first start for the club came in their 1–1 draw at home to Brentford on 22 August 2009. Since joining the club, Trotman became a first team regular for the side. His first goal for the club came in a 3–1 victory away at Southend United on 9 October 2009. After being sidelined at the start of December, Trotman then scored in a 3–1 victory over Exeter City on Boxing day, 2009. Trotman's last appearance for Southampton came in their 2–1 away defeat at Colchester United on 28 December 2009, after making 18 appearances with 17 of them starts and scoring two goals for the club.

In January 2010, he was then loaned out to League One side Huddersfield Town on loan until the end of the season. On 30 January, he made his debut in the 1–0 win against Yeovil Town at Huish Park, along with two other of Towns new signings on loan striker Nathan Eccleston and Australian left back Dean Heffernan. He scored his first goal for the club in the 2–0 win against Hartlepool United at Victoria Park on 20 February 2010. On 13 March 2010, he scored his first goal at the Galpharm Stadium against Norwich City where Town lost 3–1 in the end. Trotman became a regular in the side, replacing vice captain Nathan Clarke partnering captain Peter Clarke in Towns central defence for the second half of the season. After helping the Terriers reach the play-offs, Trotman played in both legs against Millwall, as they lost 2–0 loss to Millwall in the semi-finals. After making 23 appearances and scoring twice for the side, Huddersfield Town manager Lee Clark, confirmed he wants to bring Trotman back to the club on a permanent basis after returning to his parent club, saying: "Neal did well in his time here, playing a key role in our improved away form in the second half of the season and we're looking at his situation."

On 25 November 2010, Trotman re-joined his previous club, Oldham Athletic on loan until January 2011. It wasn't until on 3 January 2011 when he made his second debut for Oldham Athletic, setting up the club's only goal of the game, in a 1–0 loss against Rochdale. Shortly after, his loan with the club was then extended until the end of the season. Since joining Oldham Athletic, Trotman became a first team regular for the side. Despite this, Trotman went on to make 18 appearance for Oldham Athletic while on loan.

Trotman signed for English League One club Rochdale on 14 July 2011 on a two-year contract. Prior to the move, he received "several other offers" before joining Rochdale.

Trotman made his debut for Rochdale in a 2–0 loss against Sheffield Wednesday in the opening game of the season. Trotman received his a red card after a second booking offence against his former Oldham Athletics (the club started his career) as Rochdale lost 2–0. After the match, Manager Steve Eyre criticised Trotman for his "moments of madness" during the match. He was again at fault against Stevenage on 3 September 2011 when he scored an own goal, in a 4–2 loss. Despite this, he continued to regain his first team place for Rochdale until his departure. At the end of the 2011–12 season, making twelve appearances for the club, local newspaper Manchester Evening News described Trotman time at Rochdale as "big disappointments".

On 3 November 2011, Trotman joined Chesterfield on a two-month loan deal, with Dean Holden going in the opposite direction. Upon joining the club, he was given a number two shirt for the side.

He made his Chesterfield debut two days later, starting the whole game, in a 2–2 draw against Yeovil Town. The deal became permanent on 3 January 2012, having become a first team regular up until this moment. He was made captain of the side by manager John Sheridan for the rest of the season. It wasn't until on 10 March 2012 when Trotman scored his first goal for the club, in a 2–2 draw against Stevenage. However, he was is unavailable to play in the final of the Football League Trophy, having played for Rochdale in the same competition earlier in the season. However, Trotman missed the rest of the 2011–12 season, due to a knee injury, as he made 24 appearances and scoring once for the side.

Ahead of the 2012–13 season, Trotman returned from injury in the club's pre–season. At the start of the season, he continued to retain his first team status under the management of Sheridan. After Sheridan sacking, Paul Cook appointed as a new manager and under his management, Trotman's first team was limited, resulting in him placed on the transfer list, along with Craig Westcarr. Trotman returned to the first team on 12 January 2013 after the club's injury crisis in defence and made an impressive performance in a 3–0 win over Northampton Town. After the match, Trotman was praised by Cook as "absolutely magnificent" and "manful". Since returning to the first team, he was featured in a number of matches for the side. Later in the 2012–13 season, Trotman formed a defensive partner with Liam Cooper. At the end of the 2012–13 season, having made 34 appearances, Trotman was among seven players to be released by Chesterfield following his expiry of the contract.

After being released by Chesterfield, Trotman went on trial with Scottish Premiership side Partick Thistle. He was offered a contract by them, but a deal was not agreed and he then had a short trial at Dundee United. He played in a friendly against Wigan Athletic, but was not offered terms. Trotman signed a short-term contract with Plymouth Argyle in August. The move, initially until January 2014, reunited him with Sheridan, who previously signed him at Oldham and Chesterfield.

He made his debut in a League Cup game at Birmingham City the next day, playing 120 minutes, as Plymouth Argyle lost 3–2. Since joining the club, Trotman became a first team regular for the side, playing in the centre–back position. It wasn't until on 25 October 2013 when he scored his first goal for the club in a league match at Mansfield Town, which saw Plymouth Argyle won 1–0. His handful of first team football resulted in Trotman signing a contract extension with the club until the end of the season. In a match against York City on 15 February 2014, he was sent–off in early first half, as Plymouth Argyle lost 4–0. After serving a one match suspension, Trotman then scored his second goal for the club, in a 2–1 loss against Bristol Rovers on 8 March 2014. At the end of the 2013–14 season, making forty–eight appearances and scoring two times for the side, Trotman was released by Plymouth Argyle upon expiry of his contract.

On 7 August 2014, Neal agreed to a short-term deal to join Bristol Rovers in the Conference Premier following his release from Plymouth Argyle.

He made his Bristol Rovers debut against Barnet on 12 August 2014, starting a match before coming off at half time, as they lost 2–0. Trotman soon became a first team regular for the side at the start of the season. However, at the beginning of November, he suffered ankle injury that kept him out for a month. It wasn't until on 2 December 2014 when Trotman returned to the first team from injury, coming on as a substitute in the first half, in a 0–0 draw against Wrexham. He then scored his first goal for the club, in a 2–1 win over Torquay United on 26 December 2014. However, he was soon found himself away from the club, as he was placed on the substitute bench, and later sidelined with a knee injury for the rest of the season. Despite this, his involvement with Bristol Rovers this season saw the club went on to miss out on the Conference Premier league title on the final day by 1 point but earned promotion via the playoffs, triumphing on penalties against Grimsby Town, securing a return to the football league at the first time of asking.

After making 19 appearances and scoring once as the club won promotion, Trotman was released at the end of the 2014–15 season and subsequently retired from football aged 28 due to injury problems.

In April 2010, Trotman was convicted of driving without insurance.

TJ Moncur

Thomas James Moncur, also known as TJ Moncur, (born 23 September 1987) is an English footballer who plays for Cray Wanderers in the Isthmian Premier having been released by League Two side Chesterfield in 2010. He is a defender. He came through the ranks at Arsenal and Fulham without playing a first-team game, and has twice played on loan with Bradford City, before a free transfer to Wycombe Wanderers. He was released by Wycombe after playing only six games.

Born in London, Moncur attended St Ignatius' College, a Catholic secondary school for boys, located in Enfield, Middlesex, from 1999 to 2004.

Moncur was a youngster with Arsenal until he was bought aged 16. He joined the Fulham academy where he was for three years under the tutelage of Billy McKinlay, until he signed a professional contract at the age of 19 in February 2007. In January 2008, he joined Bradford City on loan for a month to provide cover for the injured Mark Bower. He was an unused substitute as Bradford defeated Macclesfield Town on 2 February 2008. After being substitute for another three games, he made his senior debut on 23 February 2008 when he was booked in a 3–1 victory at Notts County. His loan deal was extended after making two first team games for City. He returned to Fulham in April 2008 because of personal problems, after he had played seven times for Bradford City. His form during the loan spell helped him to win a new one-year contract extension at Fulham in June 2008.

On 8 August 2008, a day before the start of the 2008–09 season, he signed another loan deal with Bradford City until 3 January 2009. The agreement gave Bradford the option for the discussion of a permanent deal with Moncur once the loan period was over. He made his first appearance of his second loan spell a day later, coming on as a substitute for Paul Arnison, once more against Notts County. In Moncur's first league start of the season, as a replacement for the injured Arnison, against Shrewsbury Town in September 2008, Moncur sustained a head injury when he collided with teammate Graeme Lee. Moncur continued for nine more minutes, before he collapsed and required 12 minutes of treatment on the pitch before being rushed to hospital. He was later released from hospital, but remembers nothing of the match and could not attend his own 21st birthday party because he was not allowed to drive to his London home. Moncur was sent back to Fulham on 1 January 2009 by Bradford so that they did not have to offer him an 18-month contract, having played 18 games for Bradford.

Immediately upon his return to Fulham, Moncur was signed by another League Two club, Wycombe Wanderers on a free transfer, signing an 18-month contract. Moncur's debut at Wycombe was as a first-half substitute for Leon Johnson during their 1–0 defeat to Grimsby Town on 17 January 2009. Moncur was released by Wycombe, who had been promoted to League One in May, in October of the same year having played just six games with the Chairboys, all in the league.

Moncur dropped back to League Two in February 2010 when he signed for Chesterfield on non-contract terms following a successful trial but was released only a month later without making a single appearance.

Moncur joined Isthmian Premier side Cray Wanderers soon after being released by Chesterfield. He made his debut in the Kent Senior Cup against Ashford Town.

He made nine appearances for the club during the 1947–48 season in the Football League Third Division South. However, he dropped out of The Football League and played for Barry Town before resurrecting his professional career with Cardiff City in July 1950.

After winning promotion in his second season at Ninian Park, Howells was to spend five years playing in the First Division. This period also saw him win two caps for the Welsh national side in the 1954 World Cup qualifiers against England and Scotland.

Howells dropped back into non-league football with Worcester City but revived his league career with Chester in September 1958. He was a regular in his two seasons at Sealand Road, but was released at the end of 1959–60. Howells had continued to live in South Wales throughout his spell at Chester, who were reluctant to continue paying his expenses.

This marked the end of his professional career and he joined Barry Town.

In November 1991 Comstive moved to Chester City for £10,000. He scored in the first Football League match at the Deva Stadium between Chester and Burnley on 5 September 1992 but was released at the end of the 1992–93 season. Many of his appearances for Chester came at full-back.

This marked the end of Comstive's professional career. He joined hometown club Southport and went on to play for fellow non-league clubs Morecambe and Chorley. Comstive had a short spell on the coaching staff at Southport and also worked for Burscough. He later worked at Fleetwood Hesketh FC and at Royal Mail as a postman.

Dean Yates

Dean Yates (born 26 October 1967, in Leicester) is an English retired football defender. He lives in Burton Joyce.

He enjoyed considerable success as a player, making his Notts County debut in their 1984–85 Second Division campaign which ended in relegation. He was a regular first team player from 1985–86 onwards, helping them win promotion back to the Second Division in 1990 and to the First Division a year later (both through the playoffs). However, a serious knee injury in February 1992 ruled him out for the next two years and meant that County were without him when they needed him most — during the final quarter of the 1991–92 season when they battled against relegation from the First Division. The relegation battle was lost, and he managed just one appearance in the 1993–94 season as he made his comeback from injury.

He was fully fit for the 1994–95 season, but his presence in the team wasn't enough to prevent a relegation battle which was ultimately lost.

By the time County went down from Division One (as the old Second Division became known following the creation of the FA Premier League for the 1992–93 season), Yates had transferred to their local rivals Derby County - a £350,000 fee taking him to the Baseball Ground on 26 January 1995. He had played 314 league games in 10 years for Notts County.

The Rams had been favourites for promotion every season since their relegation from the top flight in 1991, but the closest they had come to achieving Premier League status was playoff defeats in 1992 and 1994, and when Yates arrived the playoffs were looking beyond their reach. They could only manage a ninth-place finish in 1994–95, but they achieved automatic promotion the following season as Yates's contributed 38 league appearances and two goals. However, the arrival of Igor Stimac restricted Yates to just 10 appearances in 1996–97 and nine the following season as Derby established themselves as a consistent mid table Premier League side.

He departed to Watford, newly promoted to Division One as Division Two champions, on 16 July 1998 on a free transfer. However, injury problems restricted his first team opportunities at Vicarage Road and he played just 12 games, scoring once against Bristol City, in the 1998–99 season. Watford won a second successive promotion via the playoffs and reached the Premier League, but Yates did not feature in the 1999–2000 campaign as Watford were relegated. After the end of the season, he retired from playing.

He joined Everton in 1990 and went on to feature in the Premier League. In 1995 the club won the FA Cup, although Barlow was not in the side that defeated Manchester United 1–0 in the final at Wembley Stadium, he did appear in earlier rounds including starting the quarter-final versus Newcastle United. Barlow was injured for the semi-final.

Barlow gained a reputation as a pacy striker who would willingly chase lost causes. However, his inability to find the net regularly (despite his pace often putting him through on goal) led to the affectionate nickname of Stuart 'Barndoor' Barlow amongst the Goodison support.

He joined Oldham Athletic for £350,000 a few months later by ex Everton striker and present Athletic manager Graeme Sharp. At the time he came in the Latics were struggling in the First Division. He spent nearly three seasons at the club and scored 32 goals in 93 games, but was sold to Wigan Athletic in 1998 for £45,000 by Neil Warnock. Whilst at Wigan he played in the final as they won the 1998–99 Football League Trophy.

He joined Tranmere Rovers in 2000 and is best remembered by the club's supporters for scoring a winning goal in an FA Cup fifth round replay win against Premier League club Southampton in the 2000–01 season. With then second tier Tranmere trailing 3–0 at half time, Paul Rideout scored a hat-trick to level the scores before Barlow scored the winner to put Tranmere through to the last eight. After spells with Stockport County and Bury, he joined Conference National side Morecambe in 2006 and later went on to Southport and Fleetwood Town. Whilst with Fleetwood he was loaned out to Bamber Bridge where he eventually joined permanently.

In 2010, a Merseyside Derby charity game was held between former players of Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park. Stuart scored the only goal in a 1–0 win for Everton.

In November 2011 Barlow became the Assistant manager of Northern Premier League club Colwyn Bay.

Barlow retired in 2009 despite being offered a fresh contract by Bamber Bridge. He stated his decision was so he could support and watch his young son play football for his club Formby Juniors, who Barlow ended up coaching. As well as this he also helped a friend in his scaffolding business and aided his wife open her own bridal shop.

Paul Beesley

Paul Beesley (born 21 July 1965) is an English former footballer who played primarily as a centre back. He began his career at Wigan Athletic in September 1984, before he was sold on to Leyton Orient for £175,000 in October 1989. He joined Sheffield United for £300,000 in July 1990, and was voted Player of the Year at the Premier League club in 1993. He was sold to Leeds United in August 1995 for a £250,000 fee, before moving on to Manchester City in February 1997 for £500,000. He had brief loan spells at Port Vale and West Bromwich Albion, before he was allowed to join Port Vale permanently in July 1999. He joined Chester City in the Conference in July 2000, and was voted the club's Player of the Season, before he signed with Stalybridge Celtic in October 2001. He later finished his career in Northern Ireland with Ballymena United. He later coached at Notts County and Leeds United.

Beesley joined Wigan Athletic in September 1984, where he would spend five seasons playing in the then Third Division. He played 185 games in all competitions in five years at Springfield Park, before joining Leyton Orient for £175,000 in October 1989. A first team regular Beesley played 35 league and cup games at Brisbane Road in 1989–90, helping Orient to finish comfortably in mid-table in the Third Division under Frank Clark.

Beesley was sold to Sheffield United for £300,000 in July 1990, at the time the highest fee paid for a player by the Blades. A regular in the first team he was instrumental in keeping United in the First Division in 1990–91 after their promotion from the Second Division the previous year. He played 49 times in 1992–93 as the club finished 14th in the inaugural season of Premier League football and reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup. A dependable player he was popular with the fans and was voted Player of the Year in 1993.

Now no longer an automatic choice at centre back he was instead often asked to fill in at left back as the Blades struggled unsuccessfully against relegation the following season, and failed to make an immediate return in 1994–95. He eventually left Bramall Lane having made a total of 195 league and cup appearances in five seasons.

It came as some surprise when Beesley was sold to Leeds United in August 1995 for a £250,000 fee. He was used mainly as a back-up player by manager Howard Wilkinson during his time at Elland Road, starting just 19 top-flight games in close to two seasons at the club. Unable to dislodge either Lucas Radebe or David Wetherall, new boss George Graham looked to offloaded Beesley in 1996–97.

Beesley's next move was to Manchester City in February 1997 for £500,000, rejoining his former boss at Orient, Frank Clark. He played six First Division games for the Sky Blues in 1996–97 but quickly fell out of favour at Maine Road after Joe Royle succeeded Clark as manager. Beesley spent December of the 1997–98 season on loan at Port Vale where he made five appearances before returning to Manchester, and ended the campaign on loan at West Bromwich Albion, playing eight First Division games for the Baggies.

Released by City Beesley was allowed to join Port Vale on a free transfer in August 1998 where he was disciplined by the Football Association after he picked up 12 yellow cards in 36 games during 1998–99. He left Vale Park after new manager Brian Horton took charge, and signed with Blackpool in July 1999. Beesley's best days were now behind him however and he made only 18 appearances as the Tangerines were relegated into the Third Division at the end of the 1999–2000 campaign.

Beesley signed with Chester City in July 2000 with then manager Graham Barrow describing him as "an outstanding professional". Playing more regularly than he had done at his previous club he was voted Player of the Season for 2000–01 by the Seals fans after his organizational skills helped Chester to boast the lowest goals conceded tally in the Conference. Despite this owner Terry Smith criticised Beesley for his positional play in an FA Trophy semi-final clash with Canvey Island and banished him to scouting duties – a decision Beesley described as "unexplainable".

Beesley moved on to Stalybridge Celtic in October 2001 where he played 26 times and was described as "magnificent all season" by manager Paul Futcher. However the club failed to avoid relegation out of the Conference in 2001–02, and Beesley left, finishing his career in Northern Ireland with Ballymena United.

Beesley worked as a youth team coach at Notts County, before he was appointed under-18 coach at Leeds United for a brief spell in 2007. In 2012 he was appointed as the kit man at Ipswich Town by manager Paul Jewell, before departing the role in July 2015.

Beesley's son, Jake, is also a footballer, and turned professional at Chesterfield in April 2015.

Edgar Çani

Edgar Junior Çani (born 22 July 1989) is an Albanian professional footballer who plays as a striker for the Albania national team.

Çani was born in Tirana, Albania but grew up in Città della Pieve in the Perugia central Italy, after his family emigrated to Italy in the famous exodus of the Vlora ship on 8 August 1991. He was first spotted by a Pescara scout in 2004 and started his youth career at the time. He signed his first professional contract with the "biancazzurri" in 2007. He played for Pescara in Serie C1 in the first half of the 2007–08 season overall 11 matches, 7 as a starter and 4 as a substitute, scoring 3 goals.

On 31 January 2008 Serie A side Palermo confirmed to have signed Cani, along with Luca Di Matteo, for a reported €600,000 and €500,000 fee respectively. In their June 2008 accounts Palermo showed the signings as being for €450,000 each.

Çani made his Serie A debut on 27 April 2008 in a 0–0 home tie against Atalanta coming on as a substitute in the 73rd minute in place of Edinson Cavani.

In July 2008, Ascoli confirmed they had signed Çani on loan for the 2008–09 Serie B season. He scored 4 goals in 24 appearances, most of them as a starter. Ascoli finished the season in 16th.

On 20 August 2009 Çani was signed with fellow Serie B team Padova on loan. He made his competitive debut one day later in the opening league matchday against Modena by playing the last 17 minutes of a 1–0 home win. His first score-sheet contributions came in his second ever appearance for the club one week later, scoring the equaliser in an eventual 1–1 draw at Reggina. During the first half of the 2009–10 season, Çani was below expectations, netting only twice in 19 appearances.

He left Padova in January 2010 to be loaned out to another Serie B team, Piacenza, for the rest of the season. He made his debut for Piacenza by scoring two goals in a 3–1 win over Triestina. He finished his loan spell with a respectable amount of 6 goals in 14 appearances.

After his loan move to Piacenza expired at the end of the season, Çani was sent out on loan again to Modena, another Serie B club, in July 2010. His debut occurred on 22 August 2010 in the matchday 1 against his former side Piacenza which finished in a 1–0 home win. Çani scored his first two goals with the team later on 13 November in the matchday 15 against Vicenza, leading the team into a 2–1 home win. This was followed by another goal one week later, but this time in a 3–2 away defeat to Torino. Çani was used mostly as a starter during the 2010–11 season, appearing in 34 league matches, including 22 as starter, collecting 1983 minutes. He also made 2 Coppa Italia appearances, scoring once in a 4–1 home win over Sorrento.

The following year he was sold to Polonia Warsaw. He soon got into a conflict with the club's owner, coach and team and started to look for a new team, however he decided to stay with Polonia. In the Summer of 2012 he refused to return to Poland and missed the teams pre-season training camps. After finally returning he found his opportunities limited and, after an argument with the team coach, found himself training with the youth academy team.

In total he scored 11 league goals for Polonia, with 16 of his 31 league appearances coming as a substitute. His move to Serie A side Catania was considered controversial, by the Polish media, as he was considered to be still technically a Polonia Warsaw player until 2015.

Çani made his return to Serie A, signing on 22 January 2013 for Catania on a 3-year contract. He made his debut on 3 March 2013 in a 3-2 loss against Inter, coming on as a substitute in place of Gonzalo Bergessio in the 85th minute, he was booked just a minute after coming on.

He was loaned to Serie B side Carpi F.C. on 23 July 2013. He made his debut on 11 August 2013 in a Coppa Italia - 2nd round match against Reggina, playing the full 90 minutes match in a 1–0 loss.

The match ended in a 4–1 defeat.

In January 2014 he was loaned to A.S. Bari until 30 June 2014. He made his debut in a 2-1 loss against Brescia on 1 February, coming on as an 84th-minute substitute for Stefano Sabelli. His first start came in a 0-0 draw against Crotone on 22 March, Çani played the full 90-minutes. /his second start came on 26 April 2014 against Padova, the game finished in a 2-1 victory but Cani was taken off in the 62nd minute for João Silva. Çani scored his first goal for Bari on 13 May 2014, scoring in the 2nd minute of a 2-1 win against previous club Carpi. On 30 May 2014 Çani scored twice in a 4-1 victory against Novara in the closing match of the regular season 2013–14 Serie B. Cani scored an equalizer in the 62nd minute, only 6 minutes after coming on as a substitute, and a second in the 74th minute. Bari finished the regular season in 7th place to qualify for the play-off promotions to Serie A where they shorted to play against Crotone for the quarter-finals.

Bari played Crotone on 3 June 2014 and won 3-0 result, with Çani playing the full 90-minutes. With this victory Bari advanced to the semi-finals, where they faced Latina in a two-legged tie. Çani scored in the first leg, a 2-2 draw played on 8 June 2014. The second-leg was played on 12 June 2014 and again resulted in a 2–2, Cani playing the full 90-minutes. With the aggregate score at 4–4 Latina advanced to the final as the higher placed team of the regular season, as they finished in 3rd place and Bari in 7th place.

Çani returned to Catania ahead of 2014–15 season. He wasn't included to the team for the opening match against Virtus Lanciano, but made his first appearance of the season on 7 September by starting in the 3–2 away defeat to Pro Vercelli. He then was sent off in the matchday 7 against Frosinone on 4 October 2014. receiving a red card five minutes after coming in. Çani's first score-sheet contributions of the season came later on 25 October, where he scored the opener in the 3–1 rout against Vicenza. On 6 December 2014, he scored a goal, and provided an assist, in a 2-2 draw away at Bologna. He scored the third of the campaign two weeks later, a 6th-minute header, in a 2–2 draw against Brescia.

On 2 February 2015, Çani joined Leeds United on loan for the remainder of the 2014–15 season, the deal includes an option to buy. Granddi N'Goyi's number was then changed to number six with Football League approval, with Çani taking the number 10 shirt.

He made his debut, as an 85th-minute substitute, against Brentford on 7 February 2015. He was an unused substitute in the next game, against Reading.

On 18 April 2015, Cani was one of six Massimo Cellino signings (along with Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Souleymane Doukara, Dario Del Fabro, Marco Silvestri) who controversially pulled out of the squad with an 'injury' the day before a 2-1 loss against Charlton Athletic.

On 31 August 2015, Çani confirmed his agreement with his new club Pisa of Lega Pro by signing a two-year contract. He was presented and was given squad number 9, stating that he was happy that the agreement came up after some negotiations and he will play alongside to a great coach as Gattuso.

Çani scored his first goal of the 2016–17 season in his 22nd game on 4 February 2017 against Virtus Entella as he came in as a substitute in the 68th minute for fellow Albania national team's striker Rey Manaj to score the equalizer 10 minutes later and to give his team an important 1–1 draw.

On 4 August 2017, Çani joined Albanian Superliga side Partizani Tirana by penning a two-year contract. The transfer made him the highest paid player in Albania, with an estimated monthly fee of €20,000. He was presented three days later and was given squad number 9, last worn by Mathew Boniface, stating: I'm here to win the championship."

Çani missed the opening league match against Laçi, lost 0–2, due to knee injury, but returned on 13 September in the first round of 2017–18 Albanian Cup first round against Naftëtari Kuçovë, scoring a goal in a 6–2 away win. However, his knee injury reappeared at the end of the month, which forced the striker to travel to Italy for further examinations. In December 2017, Çani underwent knee surgery again after originally going in May of the same year. He returned on training in February of the following year, and made his first appearance in over six month by entering in the last minutes of a 3–0 home win versus Luftëtari Gjirokastër on 10 March.

Çani scored his first Albanian Superliga goal for the team nine days later, netting with a header in the second half against Flamurtari Vlorë to seal a 1–0 win at home. Later in May, he was involved in a physical confrontation with team manager Klevis Dalipi during a training session. Partizani Tirana finished 5th in league which initially left them without European football, but following Skënderbeu Korçë exclusion by UEFA and later Court of Arbitration for Sport due to match-fixing, the team was given a spot for the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League first qualifying round.

Following the end of the season, Çani's monthly wage was decreased down to €6,000 after a failed first season. On 7 July, he was excluded from the UEFA Europa League team, with the manager describing it as a "tactical choice". Later on 31 July, Çani begun training with the B squad after refusing to terminate the contract by mutual consent.

On 27 August 2018, he returned to Italy, signing with Serie C club Vibonese. His contract with Vibonese was terminated by mutual consent on 21 January 2020, he has not appeared for the club since April 2019.

In February 2011 Çani told the Albanian media that it was his dream to be part of the Albania national football team. He was called up at Albania by new appointed coach Gianni De Biasi for the match against Georgia on 29 February 2012. He debuted for Albania in this match as a starter and scored his first international goal as well, only two minutes after the kick-off and the match finished as a 2–1 loss.

In the opening match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Cyprus, Çani came on as an 81st-minute substitute for Hamdi Salihi and scored in the 84th minute after a cross from Jahmir Hyka to put Albania ahead 2–1 in a game which eventually ended in a 3–1 win for Albania. In the 3rd match of the qualifiers, against Iceland, he scored after an assist by Alban Meha, but his goal wasn't enough as Iceland went on to win 2-1.

On 26 March 2013 he scored in a 4–1 win against Lithuania in a friendly match.

Çani was left out of the squads for the final two qualifying matches, against Switzerland and Cyprus on 11 and 15 October 2013.

Following the absence of fellow strikers Armando Sadiku & Rey Manaj which were injured and unable to recover in time for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification matches against Liechtenstein on 6 October 2016 and against Spain on 9 October 2016, coach Gianni De Biasi decided to return Çani to the national team after 3 years as a replacement. He was an unused substitute for both matches.
He was called up also for the next 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Israel on 12 November 2016 as Armando Sadiku wasn't recovered yet. He played against Israel coming on as a substitute in the 79th minute in place of Elseid Hysaj playing in the front line among Bekim Balaj & Rey Manaj as Albania were down by 9 men and in 0–2 disadvantage looking to score. The match however ended in the hard 0–3 loss.

Due to his height, Çani is renowned as a target man centre forward, with his strengths being his heading ability and ability to hold the ball up to bring his teammates into the game.

Roy Chapman

Roy Clifford Chapman (18 March 1934 – 21 March 1983) was an English professional footballer and manager, born in Birmingham. He was the father of former Arsenal and Leeds United striker Lee Chapman.

An inside-forward, he started his career at Aston Villa in 1952, before he moved on to Lincoln City five years later to find first team football. In 1961 he was sold to Mansfield Town, where he remained for the next four years, before he returned to Lincoln as the club's player-manager in 1965. He gave up his management duties the following year, before moving on to Port Vale in 1967. In all he scored 200 goals in 415 games in the Football League.

In 1969, he joined Stafford Rangers via Chester. He was also given the management job at Rangers, and held this position until 1975, at which point he was made manager of Stockport County. His reign at Stockport was brief, and he became a coach before returning to Stafford for a second spell as manager in 1977, before he left for a second time in 1980. As Stafford manager he led the club to a Northern Premier League, FA Trophy, and Staffordshire Senior Cup treble in 1972; as well as another Staffs Cup victory in 1973 and another FA Trophy success in 1979.

Chapman began his professional playing career with Aston Villa in February 1952, having initially joined the club as an amateur three months earlier. He made 19 appearances for the "Villans" in the First Division. Finding his first team opportunities limited at Villa Park, manager Eric Houghton allowed him to leave for Bill Anderson's Lincoln City in November 1957. The "Imps" narrowly avoided relegation out of the Second Division in 1957–58, finishing one place and one point above relegated Notts County. He finished as the club's top scorer in 1958–59 with 15 goals, as Lincoln avoided relegation despite achieving a lower points tally than in the previous campaign. They rose up the table to 13th in 1959–60, but were relegated in last place in 1960–61, despite Chapman becoming top-scorer again with 16 goals. He then departed Sincil Bank on a £7,000 move to Mansfield Town.

The "Stags" finished 14th in the Fourth Division in 1961–62 under Raich Carter's stewardship, before Chapman and strike partner Ken Wagstaff fired the club to promotion in 1962–63. Mansfield took to life in the Third Division well under new boss Tommy Cummings, and posted a seventh-place finish in 1963–64, before missing out on promotion in 1964–65 due to their inferior goal average.

Chapman left Field Mill and returned to Lincoln as player-manager in March 1965, who were by now seeking re-election to the Fourth Division. In August 1965 he came on as a substitute, replacing Bunny Larkin; this was the first substitution in the club's history. Lincoln finished 22nd in 1965–66, and once again had to apply for re-election. In October 1966 he reverted to solely a playing capacity as Ron Gray was appointed as manager. He scored 21 goals in 1966–67 to become the club's top-scorer, but despite his scoring efforts the "Imps" still finished bottom of the Football League.

In June 1967, he joined Port Vale in a playing capacity, on a wage of £35 a week. He was ever-present in the 1967–68 season, finishing as the club's top scorer with 25 goals in 49 games; he was also the division's joint top-scorer, along with Halifax Town's Les Massie. In the summer manager Stanley Matthews resigned, and Gordon Lee took charge at Vale Park. Despite suffering from sciatica, Chapman scored 12 goals in 34 games in the next season to once again become the top marksman.

His final playing club in the Football League was Ken Roberts's Chester, who he joined in May 1969. He struck five goals in four pre-season friendly matches, and then followed it up with two goals on his league debut at Scunthorpe United to take his career tally to 200. However just one more league goal followed in his next eight league games and Chapman moved on to non-league side Nuneaton Borough, before joining Stafford Rangers as player-manager.

A two footed player, he was aggressive and had ball control skills, but lacked pace.

Chapman steered Stafford Rangers to a treble of the FA Trophy, Northern Premier League and Staffordshire Senior Cup in 1972. Rangers topped the league with 71 points, and beat Barnet 3–0 at Wembley in the Trophy final. This was followed up by him leading Rangers to the FA Cup fourth round three years later. He then returned to professional circles with a short spell as Stockport County manager, where he signed George Best on a short-term deal. His reign at Stockport was short and he returned to Port Vale as a coach in August 1976, before being sacked in May 1977 and returning to Stafford.

In his second spell in charge of Rangers he led them to another FA Trophy triumph (this time a 2–0 victory over Kettering Town) before standing down in 1980.

After leaving Rangers he took up the position as manager of Walsall Sports Company.

He died in Stoke-on-Trent, three days after his 49th birthday. He had suffered a fatal heart attack, when playing in a five-a-side tournament.

Three games later he scored in the 5–4 defeat against Kidderminster Harriers.

England C manager Paul Fairclough confirmed that Thomas had been close to getting an international call-up, and on 10 November 2011 Aswad Thomas was included in the stand-by contingency squad for the England C team in the friendly against Gibraltar on the following Tuesday. On 26 November 2011 Thomas received his 2nd yellow card of the season in the 10th minute for unsporting behaviour and was sent off in the 85th minute for his second bookable offence, an unfair foul on Curtis Obeng, serving a one match ban after the 0–0 stalemate against Wrexham.

Gary Parkinson

Gary Anthony Parkinson (born 10 January 1968) is an English former professional footballer who played as a right-back.

In 2006, he was appointed Head of Youth at his former club Blackpool, a role he occupied until he suffered a severe stroke in September 2010, leading to a diagnosis of locked-in syndrome.

Thornaby-born Parkinson started his career as a junior at Everton in 1985 before signing for Middlesbrough, who were then in the Second Division, on 17 January 1986, although they were relegated at the end of the season to the Third Division. Parkinson's first team debut came in the following season on 23 August 1986 in a 2–2 home draw against Port Vale which was played at Victoria Park, Hartlepool. With Middlesbrough on the verge of extinction, the official receiver had locked the club out of Ayresome Park. However, they went on to win promotion as runners-up under Bruce Rioch's management. In the 1987–88 Middlesbrough won a second promotion in two years, winning a promotion/relegation play-off against Chelsea after finishing in third place in the Second Division. Chelsea were then replaced by Middlesbrough in the First Division. The following season though he was relegated with Middlesbrough back to the Second Division. In the 1989–90 season he played in the Full Members Cup final (then known as the Zenith Data Systems Cup) as Middlesbrough to Chelsea at Wembley. He was part of the team that won promotion again, finishing as Second Division runner-up in the 1991–92 season. The following season, he was a member of the Middlesbrough squad in the inaugural Premier League season as Middlesbrough once again lasted just one season in the top flight and were relegated.

In October 1992 he spent a short time on loan with Southend United who were then in the First Division. He made a total of 265 appearances in all competitions and scored eight league goals while at Middlesbrough.

Later that season, he followed former Middlesbrough manager Bruce Rioch, when on 2 March 1993 Rioch signed him on a free transfer for Bolton Wanderers, who were then in the Second Division, and who promoted at the end of the season. However, Parkinson made only three league appearances for them, with just one start after failing to displace the long serving Phil Brown. He was transfer listed by Rioch along with three other first team players in September 1993

He signed for Second Division club Burnley the following season on 27 January 1994. Burnley were promoted to the First Division through the play-offs at the end of the season. They beat Stockport County in the play-off final at Wembley, with Parkinson scoring the crucial winning goal that sealed their promotion. Burnley were though relegated the following season. On 18 November 1995 in a 3–1 defeat against Shrewsbury Town at Gay Meadow Parkinson tore a hamstring and was out of action until the new year.

On the eve of the 1997–98 season he signed for Burnley's Lancashire rivals Preston North End for £50,000. He became a regular in the team, but 18 months later he injured his cruciate ligament and needed an operation which kept him out of action for twelve months. He had made just one league appearance in the 1998–99 season and missed Prestons promotion as Second Division champions in the 1999–2000 season. He returned to action the following seasons as the club played their first season back in the second tier of English football for the first time in twenty years under manager David Moyes, with a return to action coming in December 1999.

On 22 March 2001 he signed for Preston's West Lancashire rivals Blackpool, then playing in the Third Division, for a fee of £20,000. He made 24 league appearances for "the Seasiders" winning promotion to the Second Division through the play-offs in the 2000–01 season, the fifth promotion win of his career. He was released at the end of the 2001–02 season and went on to play part-time with Northern Premier League (NPL) club Stalybridge Celtic on 17 August 2002. However, his stay lasted just two weeks, playing in four matches before leaving on 30 August. He also played part-time with fellow NPL club Rossendale United, whom he signed for on 11 February 2003.

After retiring from playing football Parkinson studied for his UEFA coaching badges, and also worked for an organisation called SpeedMark, who employ ex-pro footballers to help schools raise money through football. Parkinson left SpeedMark in June 2006 to become the Head of the Youth Department at Blackpool, in charge of all youth team affairs. The youth team compete in the Football League Youth Alliance, North West Conference. In the 2007–08 season he won the Lancashire FA Youth Cup with Blackpool on 28 April 2008 when they beat Wigan Athletic 2–0 at Bloomfield Road.

Matthew Ronald Brazier (2 July 1976 – 4 February 2019) was an English professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He began his career with Queens Park Rangers before joining fellow London based side Fulham in 1998. After a brief loan spell at Cardiff City, Brazier joined the "Bluebirds" on a permanent deal for a fee of £100,000. He helped the club win promotion during the 2000–01 season but fell out of favour under manager Alan Cork and was allowed to join Leyton Orient six months later.

Brazier began his career at Queens Park Rangers, making his way through the club's youth system. The 1995–96 season saw him establish himself in the Premier League side, during his time at Queens Park Rangers he played in both the Premier League and the Championship, he left to join neighbours Fulham for the 1998-1999 season. He scored on his first start for the club in a match against Preston North End, but his spell at Fulham was brief as he struggled to make an impact in the side and he was eventually was allowed to go on loan to Cardiff City.

His loan spell saw him make 11 appearances for the club and, despite a back injury disrupting his time at the club, his performances persuaded Cardiff to pay £100,000 for him at the end of the 1998–99 season. His first season back at the club did not live up to the expectations set during his loan spell at the club and it was not until his second year that he managed to return to form only for an illness to disrupt his season. He helped the team win promotion to the Second Division during the 2000–01 season as they finished as runners-up to Brighton & Hove Albion.

In the 2001–02 season, Brazier fell out of favour with manager Alan Cork after being told on the first day of pre-season training that he had been placed on the transfer list, along with a number of other players, including Jason Fowler, Scott McCulloch and Andy Thompson, who labelled themselves the "death camp" due to their exclusion from first team activity. He made just one appearance during the season, in October 2001, during a 7–1 victory over Rushden & Diamonds in the Football League Trophy. Brazier became disgruntled with the situation and launched a scathing attack on Cork, stating "I didn't matter if I played out of my skin for the reserves, I wasn't going to get a game at Cardiff this season and Alan Cork made that clear to me at the start. [...] He might say there wasn't a problem between us, but I think there was. I don't think he wanted me anywhere near the club."

Brazier and Kevin Nugent both saw moves to Colchester United collapse in December 2001, but the pair eventually moved to Leyton Orient in January 2002. Brazier spent two years with Leyton Orient before retiring in 2004.

On 4 February 2019, Brazier died, aged 42, following a battle with non-Hodgkin follicular lymphoma.

Michael Charles Lake (born 16 November 1966), commonly known as Mike Lake, is an English retired footballer.

Lake was born in Manchester. After being a peripheral figure in his first few seasons at Sheffield United and hindered by injuries, Lake then featured more regularly in the early 1990s once United were back in the old First Division. Lake's time at United is best remembered during the 1991–92 season where he had a consistent spell in the team and scored 4 times in 4 games, all of which were opportunist and often spectacular. Lake, with his distinctive long hair and sudden goal scoring streak, became a cult-hero at United and as a result of the spectacular goals the Blades fans nicknamed Lake, Mike "Zico" Lake, after the famous Brazilian footballer Arthur Antunes Coimbra, better known as Zico. In particular, Lake is remembered at United for his long range goal against Southampton in a 4–2 victory at The Dell. The goal was also nominated for goal of the month and was described as a "Brazilian bender" by United's manager Dave Bassett. Lake also scored a second in the same match, again from long range, this time aided by a deflection.

In search of regular first team football, Lake joined Wrexham in November of the 1992–93 season, first in a three-month loan which was then made permanent in a £40,000 deal later on in the season, much to the delight of the Wrexham fans, of which numerous had written to Lake personally asking him to join permanently, upon the end of his loan spell. Lake again became a favourite and won promotion with Wrexham during the same season. Injuries began to then take their toll and Lake was released by Wrexham at the end of the 1994–95 season. Lake won the Welsh Cup in his final season at the Racecourse Stadium. Wrexham was Lake's last club as injuries prevented him from playing elsewhere and he had to retire.

He is the elder brother of former Manchester City favourite Paul Lake.

England won the match "quite comfortably" 6–1, with Yates scoring a hat trick. Despite this, he was not selected for the match against Scotland six weeks later. He is one of five players to have scored a hat-trick on his England debut, yet not make a second appearance.

He continued to make sporadic appearances for Burnley over the next few years, before retiring from playing in 1894, returning to his profession of cotton weaver.

During his later years he was landlord of the Brickmakers' Arms, a pub near to the Turf Moor ground in Burnley. He died of cancer on 1 June 1917.

He scored on his Football League debut for Bradford City. Throughout his career he has won 3 promotions and has claimed Player of the year on one occasion in 2015. 

Brown was born in York, North Yorkshire, and spent ten years in Leeds United's youth set up before he moved to Nottingham Forest at the start of the 2007–08 season. In November 2007, he joined Eastwood Town on an initial one-month loan, which was later extended for a second month. He returned to Forest in January 2008, after scoring five goals in ten games with Eastwood. He departed Forest and joined Bradford City on deadline day. After scoring twice in a 4–4 reserve game with Sunderland and another against Hull City, he was handed a contract until the end of the season. He made his debut two days later on 2 February 2008 as a second-half substitute and scored six minutes after he came on to give Bradford a 1–0 victory over Macclesfield Town. On 29 April 2008, Brown along with a staggering 13 players out of contract were deemed to be surplus to requirements at Valley Parade and was released by manager Stuart McCall. He played five games for City, all as substitute.

Following his departure, Brown joined Conference National club York City on trial in July 2008, scoring twice in a pre-season friendly game against Tadcaster Albion, which York won 6–0.

Later the same month, he was given a trial at Northern Premier League Premier Division side Guiseley, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2–1 pre-season friendly victory over former side Bradford City. After scoring 2 goals in another pre-season game against a Leeds United XI, he joined Guiseley on a permanent basis.

Christopher Jack Michael Turner (born 26 August 1990) is an English semi-professional footballer who played in the Football League, as a Midfielder for Accrington Stanley. He currently plays for North West Counties Premier League side Barnoldswick Town.

Turner was born in Burnley and educated at St Theodore's RC High School in the town. He started his footballing career as a seven-year-old with local junior side Brierfield Celtic, and later St Joseph's in Accrington. In 2009, Turner joined the youth system at Burnley.

Alfred Strange

Alfred Henry Strange (2 April 1900 – October 1978) was an English footballer who played most of his career as a half back with Sheffield Wednesday. He won 20 caps for England, including three as captain.

He began his career at Portsmouth, helping "Pompey" to win the Third Division South title in 1923–24. He then transferred to Port Vale, and impressed at the club enough to win a move to Sheffield Wednesday in February 1927. He spent eight years with the club, helping Wednesday to win the First Division title in 1928–29 and 1929–30. He ended his professional career at Bradford Park Avenue in 1936. Over the course of his 14 years in the Football League he scored 63 goals in 382 league appearances. He spent a brief spell as manager of Bedford Town after World War II.

Strange was born in Ripley, Derbyshire and as a youth played for the Marehay Colliery team, where he was spotted by scouts from Portsmouth, for whom he signed as a professional in December 1922. He started his career with Portsmouth as a centre-forward and in his two seasons there he scored 16 goals from 24 league appearances, helping them to win the Third Division South title in 1923–24.

Frustrated at the lack of regular first team opportunities at Fratton Park, Strange moved to Second Division club Port Vale in 1924. His excellent ball control and powerful shots impressed the fans at The Old Recreation Ground, as the club enjoyed some of its most successful years with three successive eighth-place finishes. At Port Vale he was a regular selection at inside forward, scoring seven goals in 33 league and FA Cup games in 1924–25. He claimed 17 goals in 42 games in 1925–26, including a hat-trick in a 4–2 win over Clapton Orient on 2 January and four goals in a 5–0 victory over Blackpool on 6 February. He scored five goals in 28 appearances in the first half of the 1926–27 season. In February 1927 he was transferred to Sheffield Wednesday, with Harry Anstiss and "a substantial financial consideration" moving in the opposite direction.

He claimed five goals in just 13 First Division games in the latter half of the 1926–27 campaign. He was limited to only 17 appearances in the 1927–28 season. After he was switched to right half "his career blossomed". He was an "ever present" when Wednesday won the Football League title in 1928–29, and in the following season he missed only one league match as Wednesday claimed the title for the second consecutive year. He played in Sheffield Wednesday's 2–1 defeat by Arsenal in the Charity Shield at Stamford Bridge in October 1930.

Strange played 42 games in 1930–31, as Wednesday dropped to third position with Arsenal running away with the title. He scored three goals in 45 matches in 1931–32, helping the club to another third-place finish behind Arsenal and champions Everton. He claimed five goals in 43 appearances in the 1932–33 season, as Wednesday made another third-place finish behind Arsenal and Aston Villa. However, he featured just 20 times in the 1933–34 season. He missed out on all but one game of the 1934–35 season and was unable to play in any of Wednesday's matches in the FA Cup, when they went on to win the final against West Bromwich Albion 4–2.

In May 1935, after 253 league and 19 cup appearances at Hillsborough, Strange transferred to Second Division side Bradford Park Avenue. He played the 1935–36 season at Horsfall Stadium before dropping down to lower league football, returning to his place of birth to play for Ripley Town. He also played for the Raleigh Cycles team and for Corsham United.

Strange was selected to represent the Football League three times, before receiving his first England cap for the match against Scotland on 5 April 1930. He played at right half as England won 5–2, with Vic Watson and Strange's Wednesday teammate Ellis Rimmer each scoring twice. Two other Sheffield Wednesday players, Ernie Blenkinsop and Billy Marsden, also played in this match.

In May 1930, he accompanied England on a European tour where he played against Germany and Austria, both matches being drawn. He continued to be selected for England over the next few years, being appointed captain for a 5–2 loss to France on 14 May 1931 and a 3–1 win over Wales on 18 November 1931.

His final England appearance came at White Hart Lane on 6 December 1933, when he was able to gain "revenge" for the defeat by France two years earlier, with England winning 4–1 (George Camsell scoring twice).

Following World War II, Strange was appointed manager of Southern League side Bedford Town in April 1945, a position he held until resigning in January 1947. After retiring from football, he settled in Ripley and worked as a poultry farmer. In 1979 a room at the Ripley Leisure Centre was named the "Alf Strange Room" in his honour.

He notably played for Vitesse Arnhem, Ajax and Grimsby Town. He also played for FC Den Bosch, HFC Haarlem, Sparta Rotterdam and Go Ahead Eagles before being forced to retirement at the age of 30.

Originally Willems was scouted by Dutch giants Ajax and he signed to the Amsterdam based giants when he was a youngster and took the step up to the first team in 1996. After one season of limited chances or football action, Willems left Ajax bound for fellow Eredivisie side Vitesse Arnhem where he would remain until 1999.

He then spent a season playing with FC Den Bosch before returning to Vitesse a year later. In November 2001, Menno signed a three month loan deal with English club Grimsby Town as Mariners boss Lennie Lawrence brought in a wave of foreign talent following the dismissal of Alan Buckley. Willems along with David Nielsen, Knut Anders Fostervold and Zhang Enhua linked up with the club on loan.

After the end of his three month loan deal Grimsby paid Vitesse £160,000 for Menno, and made him one of the most highly paid players at the club. He played out the final few months of the 2000/2001 season and was the only foreign loan star too sign a permanent deal. In the new season, slight injury problems coupled with performances of other players saw Willems fall out of favour at the club under new manager Paul Groves. In May 2002, Willems left the club on a free transfer.

He soon returned to the Netherlands, playing for HFC Haarlem for two seasons, before playing out the next two seasons with Sparta Rotterdam and Go Ahead Eagles.

Willems called time on his professional football career at the end of the 2005/2006 season. Because of wear and tear to the cartilage in his knee, he was advised to end his football career.

Willems is related to fellow footballer and former Derby County midfielder Ron Willems.

In 2012 Willems was sent to prison in Belgium for fraud following the collapse of his flowers business.

Ian Edwards (footballer, born 1955)

Robert Ian Edwards (born 30 January 1955) is a Welsh former footballer who played as a forward. He was capped by Wales and played in The Football League for four clubs.

Born in Rossett, Edwards began his playing days with non-league side Rhyl, before joining West Bromwich Albion in February 1973. He marked his league debut two years later by scoring in a 4–0 win over Sheffield Wednesday. But he found first-team opportunities at West Brom limited and in November 1976 he joined Chester for £18,000. A debut goal against Northampton Town followed and Edwards went on to score a hat-trick in the club's 4–0 win at Southend United and a last minute winner against Luton Town as Chester reached the FA Cup fifth round. Unfortunately he was injured scoring against Rotherham United in March 1977, with a knee injury that was to have lasting repercussions for the player.

The 1978–79 season saw Edwards back in regular action, scoring in a Football League Cup giantkilling win over Coventry City. In October 1978, Edwards scored four times for Wales in a 7–0 win against Malta and then followed it up with a hat-trick in his next Chester appearance against Brentford. 12 months later he moved to Wrexham for £125,000, having scored in his final Chester appearance at Barnsley. His move led to Ian Rush successfully becoming Chester's regular centre-forward.

Edwards spent three years at Wrexham and then joined Crystal Palace under the guidance of new manager Alan Mullery for a largely unsuccessful spell. However, Edwards struck the decisive winner for Palace in their final game of the season against Burnley to save them from relegation to Division Three with his final touch for the club. This was to also mark the end of his professional career as he retired due to his injuries and he played briefly for Mold Alexandra and Porthmadog. Outside of football he worked as a milkman in the Wrexham area and then became the owner of a hotel near Criccieth. He also had a spell as manager of Porthmadog before being replaced by Mickey Thomas.

Mickey Bell

Michael Bell (born 15 November 1971) is an English former footballer who is now manager at Western League Premier Division club Clevedon Town. In a seventeen-year career as a professional in the English Football League he made 694 league and cup appearances with five different clubs, playing as a defender.

Starting his career with Northampton Town in 1990, over a four-year period he would make over 150 appearances for the club. He then transferred to Wycombe Wanderers for £55,000 in October 1994, where he would make 118 league appearances in a three-year spell. He then made a £150,000 move to Bristol City in August 1997, and would make 345 appearances in all competitions, in an eight-year association with the club. He then spent a brief spell at Port Vale, before joining Cheltenham Town in January 2006. He then dropped into non-League football with Team Bath and Weston-super-Mare, before being appointed as manager of Clevedon Town in May 2010. He left Clevedon in January 2014, and four months later took charge for a brief spell at Weston-super-Mare.

He won numerous honours during his career, being voted onto the PFA Team of the Year for the Second Division in 1999–2000, 2000–01, 2001–02, and 2002–03. He helped Bristol City to promotion out of the Second Division in 1997–98, and played in the finals of the Football League Trophy in 2000 and 2003. He also helped Cheltenham Town to win the League Two play-off final in 2006.

Bell started his career at Northampton Town, a club pushing for the Fourth Division play-offs in 1990–91 under the stewardship of Theo Foley. The "Cobblers" dropped to 16th in 1991–92, before plummeting to 20th place in 1992–93 under Phil Chard. They then flat-lined in 1993–94 under John Barnwell, finishing bottom of the Football League.

Bell left the County Ground on a £55,000 transfer to Wycombe Wanderers in October 1994. Martin O'Neill led the "Chairboys" to one place and three points outside the Second Division play-offs in 1994–95. However they dropped to 12th in 1995–96 under new boss Alan Smith. John Gregory then took over at Adams Park, and led Wycombe 18th in 1996–97, as Bell made 51 appearances and was voted as the club's Player of the Year.

He moved on a £150,000 transfer to Bristol City in August 1997, and scored ten goals in 52 games in 1997–98, as John Ward led the "Robins" to the runners-up spot of the Second Division. He made 37 appearances in 1998–99, scoring five goals (including four penalties), as City were relegated out of the First Division in last place under new boss Benny Lennartsson. He scored five goals in 43 appearances in 1999–2000, retaining his first team place as manager Tony Pulis left and was replaced by David Burnside. He also went on to play in the Football League Trophy final at Wembley, which ended in a 2–1 defeat to Stoke City.

Danny Wilson took the management reins at Ashton Gate in 2000–01, and Bell retained his first team place, scoring four goals in 49 appearances. Bell scored eight goals in 48 games in 2001–02, as City missed out on the play-offs by finishing one place and five points behind Huddersfield Town in the play-offs. He scored four goals in 46 games in 2002–03, as City reached the play-off semi-finals, only to lose to Cardiff City. Bell was part of a solid back four along with Matt Hill, Tony Butler, and Danny Coles. The club reached the Football League Trophy final for a second time, this time held at the Millennium Stadium, and Bell played 85 minutes of the 2–0 victory over Carlisle United; he was substituted for Matt Hill, as Louis Carey had started the match in Hill's place. He played 30 games in 2003–04, but did not feature in the play-offs as City lost 1–0 to Brighton & Hove Albion in the play-off final. He made 35 appearances in 2004–05, as new boss Brian Tinnion led the club to a 7th-place finish, one place and one point behind Hartlepool United in the play-offs. Bell was later named in the Bristol City Hall Of Fame.

He joined Martin Foyle's Port Vale on a free transfer in July 2005, citing the fact that he knew a few players already on the team as a factor in his decision. However, the stay was brief as Bell headed for the exit door at Vale Park after 15 League One appearances in 2005–06. Bell stated the long commute as well as family reasons for the mutual termination agreement. He signed with Cheltenham Town of League Two in January 2006, who were managed by his former boss John Ward. He played 12 games in 2005–06, and featured in the 1–0 play-off final victory over Grimsby Town; he was a 27th-minute substitute for Craig Armstrong. His time at Whaddon Road was riddled with injuries; he required surgery on his achilles and he did not appear for the "Robins" past Boxing Day of the 2006–07 campaign; subsequently, Bell was not offered a contract in the summer. He was then appointed as a player coach at Team Bath. In December 2007, he began training to be a plumber, but finished the courses and started to train with Weston-super-Mare of the Conference South, where he signed a contract in February 2008. He eventually made ten appearances for the club before being released at the end of the season.

Despite becoming a qualified plumber, he returned to the game in May 2010 when he was appointed manager of Southern League side Clevedon Town. His side finished 20th in the 22 team division in 2010–11 and 2011–12, and then 15th in 2012–13. He also led the "Seasiders" to victory in the Southern League Cup in 2012, and to the Somerset Premier Cup final in the same year (losing to Weston-super-Mare). Bell left the club in January 2014. In April 2014, he joined Mangotsfield United as a coach for a two-month period.

In May 2014, Bell was named as the new manager at Conference South club Weston-super-Mare. He left the club by mutual consent in November after they dropped into the relegation zone of the Conference South. He rejoined Clevedon as manager in July 2015. He led Clevedon to a 19th-place finish in the Western League Premier Division in 2015–16 and a 14th-place finish in 2016–17.

Gary Bellamy

Gary Bellamy (born 4 July 1962) is an English former professional footballer. He began his career at Chesterfield, making over 150 appearances for the club before joining Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1987. He helped the club to back-to-back promotions from Division Four to Division Two, as well as winning the Football League Trophy in 1988. He had a brief spell on loan at Cardiff City in 1982 before moving to Leyton Orient.

Bellamy later joined Chelmsford City as player-manager and also managed Dover Athletic and Braintree Town.

Bellamy had a spell at Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club as a teenager, but decided to pursue a career in football instead, joining Chesterfield as a trainee. He broke into the first team and played seven seasons at Saltergate. He won the (old) Fourth Division championship in 1984–85 with the club and made a total of 207 appearances in all competitions for the Spirites, despite missing 15 months through injury. Following his return from injury, Bellamy was set to move to Birmingham City but the transfer collapsed.

He left the club in July 1987 after becoming embroiled in a contract dispute to join then-fourth tier Wolverhampton Wanderers for a £17,500 fee set at tribunal. After making his debut for the club on 12 September 1987 in a 2–2 draw with Crewe Alexandra, he won the Fourth Division championship for the second time in his career. The defender also got to experience a Wembley final as the club lifted the Football League Trophy at the end of the season too, defeating Burnley 2–0 in the final. His second season with Wolves saw him add another medal as the club immediately won the (old) Third Division. He remained a first choice player in his first season at the second flight level in 1989–90 but subsequently was used only sparingly in the following two seasons.

At the start of the 1991–92 season, Bellamy contracted Lyme disease on a pre-season tour of Scandinavia which kept him out for the opening weeks of the season and he was unable to force his way back into the side on his return. He joined Cardiff City on loan in a bid to regain fitness toward the end of the season, making nine league appearances for the "Bluebirds".

The following season, Bellamy was sold to Third Division Leyton Orient for £30,000 in September 1992. Here, he played as a first choice player for four seasons, despite continued friction with then manager Peter Eustace, before leaving for non-league Chelmsford City in June 1996. Just five months later, he took up a joint manager role for the club and spent five years in this capacity, winning promotion to the Isthmian League Premier Division in 2001. He had earlier guided them to promotion in 1998, but their ground was deemed not to meet the requirements of the higher division at that time.

This promotion success alerted Conference side Dover Athletic to him and he took up the reins there following this in June 2001. However, he was sacked only months later in November as the club struggled. He became manager of Braintree Town, where he had had a loan spell as a player, but was later fired in November 2003.

His second season was equally impressive, scoring four in 29 appearances. In the 2003–04 season, Demouge made his debut in the UEFA Cup, coming on as a 74th-minute substitute against Wisła Kraków. Demouge's final season was a disastrous year. With the end of his contract fast approaching, he was plagued with injuries and was eventually released from NEC.

His first goals came in a 6–0 home win against Excelsior where he scored a brace. He managed to net eight times that season. The following season was Demouge's most prolific, managing fourteen goals in thirty two appearances. During this time, there was alleged interest of the Belgian side Club Brugge and Dutch side SC Heerenveen. However, he indicated that he has an aspiration to play English football and signed an extension.

After attracting much interest from around Europe, he signed a three-year contract with FC Utrecht on 31 August 2010, on the transfer deadline day. During his first two seasons, he scored thirteen times in over forty three appearances, including a goal in a 3-3 UEFA Europa League draw against Italian side Napoli for whom Edinson Cavani netted a hattrick. However, again his time was plagued through injury and was released in the summer of 2012, a year before his expiration.

Demouge joined League One in June 2012, making the switch to England. It was reported that he was recommended by Bournemouth co-chairman Max Demin. During pre-season, he injured his knee again, this time during training which required surgery.

He made his debut in a 2-1 home defeat to Walsall FC, on 29 September playing the full 90 minutes. During his second game for the Cherries, Demouge suffered a broken nose and concussion following a head collision and was stretchered off in the 11th minute. There was another setback for the Dutch striker, suffering a calf injury in a reserves game. Amid rumors of an imminent return to the Netherlands, Demouge publicly stated his commitment to the club.

After playing half a season on loan for Eredivisie side Roda JC Kerkrade, Demouge dissolved his contract with Bournemouth and signed a two-year deal with Roda JC Kerkrade.

In September 2015 Demouge signed a one-year contract at Knokke in the Belgian Fourth Division.

He joined Dutch amateur side RKSV Heer in January 2017 after being without a club for some time.

Alan Irvine (footballer, born 1962)

Alan James Irvine (born 29 November 1962) is a Scottish former footballer, who played as a striker for a number of clubs in Scotland, England, Japan and Northern Ireland.

Irvine began his career with Blackburn United, but was also on Schoolboy forms with Hibernian, before signing at 16 on professional forms until 18. Irvine failed to make a senior appearance for the Easter Road side and moved to Whitburn Juniors, before joining Falkirk in 1983. After four years, and over 100 league appearances for the "Bairns", Irvine moved to Liverpool. However, he made just four appearances during his time on Merseyside, one of which was as a second-half substitute in Liverpool's Littlewoods Cup quarter-final win against Everton at Goodison Park.

A similarly short spell at Dundee United followed, before fifteen months at Shrewsbury Town.

Sébastien Bassong

Sébastien Aymar Bassong Nguena (born 9 July 1986) is a professional footballer who plays as a defender.

Born in Paris, France, Metz signed Bassong out of the Clairefontaine academy. After progressing through the ranks of the FC Metz's youth team, he was promoted to the reserve side for the 2004–05 season.

In the 2005–06 season, Bassong was promoted to the first team and made his professional debut for FC Metz, starting the whole game, in a 0–0 draw against Strasbourg on 23 August 2005, keeping a clean sheet in a process. Following his debut, Bassong soon received a handful of first team appearances for the side throughout the 2005–06 season. In his first professional season at FC Metz, Bassong went on to make twenty–four appearances in all competitions. At the end of the 2005–06 season, he was offered his first professional contract, which he signed a three–year contract.

The 2006–07 season saw Bassong becoming a first team regular for FC Metz, establishing himself in the defensive position. He said that he progressed in the first team, as the season progressed. Since the start of the 2006–07 season, Bassong started in every matches until he missed one match, due to international commitment. After his return to the starting lineup, he helped the side kept five clean sheets between on 30 March 2007 and 27 April 2007. During the encounter, Bassong helped the side beat Amiens 2–0 on 20 April 2007 to secure their place in Ligue 1 next season after being relegated in the previous season. On 18 May 2007, Bassong scored his first professional goal for the side, in a 2–1 loss against Strasbourg. At the end of the 2006–07 season, he went on to make thirty–eight appearances and scoring once in all competitions.

In the 2007–08 season, with the club playing in Ligue 1, Bassong, however, was sidelined at the start of the season, due to hamstring he sustained in the pre–season. It wasn't until on 15 September 2007 when he returned to the starting up for the side, in a 5–1 loss against Lyon. Halfway through the 2007–08 season, Bassong was soon sidelined with suspension and another injury. At the end of the 2007–08 season, which saw FC Metz relegated once again, Bassong went on to make twenty–four appearances in all competitions.

During his three years spell at FC Metz, Bassong played seventy–nine times and scoring once, in the French second tier.

In July 2008, Bassong was offered a one-week trial with Newcastle United and made his debut in a pre-season friendly against Doncaster Rovers. On 30 July, it was confirmed that Newcastle had agreed a fee of £500,000 with Metz for Bassong.

Bassong made his professional debut for Newcastle on 26 August 2008 in a League Cup game away to Coventry City, before playing his first league game for Newcastle away to Arsenal five days later when he came on as a substitute for José Enrique. Since joining the club, Bassong began to receive a handful of first team appearances for the side, playing in the left–back position. Despite the club's struggles in the league, his performance was praised by Manager Joe Kinnear. Following the return of José Enrique, Bassong moved to playing in the centre–back position. However, he received his first red card for the club away to Wigan Athletic on 26 December 2008. Following his return from suspension, Bassong continued to regain his first team place for the side despite suffering from groin injury and then was sent–off once again on 16 May 2009 as part of 0–1 home defeat to Fulham in the penultimate game of the season. In his first season at Newcastle United, Bassong went on to make thirty–four appearances in all competitions.

At the end of the season, Bassong was named the Newcastle Player of the Season for 2008–09. He was considered by the club's supporters as the best signing this season. Following Newcastle's relegation to the Championship, Bassong expressed his desire to leave the club, with Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur linked with him. But the club was keen on selling him for £15 million. In July 2009, Bassong said he wanted to leave the club, which he later cited "shambolic political situation at the club, with no manager or owner in place and pre-season well under way". The following month, Bassong was fined by Newcastle United for not traveling with the squad during the club's pre–season tour.

On 6 August 2009, it was confirmed he had passed a medical at Spurs signing a five-year deal and completed an £8 million move to the North London club that same day. Newcastle United previously rejected a £10 million from Tottenham Hotspur for him.

Bassong scored on his debut for Tottenham in a 2–1 victory over Liverpool, heading in the winner from a free kick cross from teammate Luka Modrić in the 59th minute. During a 3–0 loss against Chelsea on 22 September 2009, he suffered a concussion "after falling awkwardly in a collision with Nicolas Anelka" and had to be substituted. But Bassong was given an "all clear", allowing him to return to the starting lineup for the side. He started in every matches since the start of the season, due to the absent of Jonathan Woodgate and Ledley King until he missed one match in early–November after suffering from a hamstring injury. Since returning to the first team from a hamstring injury, Bassong continued to fight for his first team place, as he was featured in and out of the club's starting lineup. At the end of the 2009–10 season, Bassong went on to make thirty–eight appearances and scoring once in all competitions.

At the start of Tottenham's 2010–11 Champions League campaign, Bassong scored Spurs' first goal in a 3–2 losing effort to Swiss club Young Boys. However, he failed to start or make the bench for the second leg in which Spurs won 4–0 (6–3 on aggregate), sending Tottenham into the Champions League group stages. During a 4–1 loss against rivals, Arsenal on 22 September 2010, Bassong fouled Samir Nasri in the penalty box, which Nasri, himself, converted the penalty successfully; and after the match, he said about the foul: "I touched his chest but I did not grab him. He went down too easily. He told me afterwards that I just barely touched him." However, Bassong found himself behind the pecking order in the centre–backs and found himself in the substitute bench and cover role throughout the season. At the end of the 2010–11 season, Bassong only made 12 league appearances during the season with one league goal away at Birmingham City on 4 December 2010.

Ahead of the 2011–12 season, Bassong expressed his desire to leave Tottenham Hotspur, citing lack of first team opportunities at the club. Throughout the summer transfer window, he was linked a move to Newcastle United and Queens Park Rangers, but ultimately stayed at Tottenham Hotspur. However, he continued to remain behind the pecking order in the centre–backs. Despite this, Bassong captained the side for the first time in the UEFA Europa League against Rubin Kazan on 21 October 2011; and helped the side win 1–0. In the next encounter against Rubin Kazan on 3 November 2011, however, he was at fault for giving away a free kick, leading to a goal from the opposition team, as Tottenham Hotspur lost 1–0. By the time he departed to Wolverhampton Wanderers for the rest of the 2011–12 season, Bassong made thirteen appearance for Tottenham Hotspur this season.

On 31 January 2012, Bassong joined fellow Premier League side Wolverhampton Wanderers on loan until the end of the 2011–12 season. Upon joining Wolverhampton Wanderers, he said he joined the club because of first team football.

Four days later, he made his debut for Wolves, playing the full 90 minutes in the 2–1 win against QPR. After suffering a hamstring injury, he returned to the starting lineup and featured in a number of matches in the first team until his sending off in the early first–half, in a 3–0 loss against Arsenal. However, his loan spell with Wolves did not prevent the club from being relegated after a 2–0 home loss to Manchester City. At the end of the 2011–12 season, Bassong made nine appearances for the side and returned to his parent club.

On 21 August 2012, Bassong signed with Norwich City for an undisclosed fee. This deal linked him back up with Chris Hughton who he worked under at Newcastle.

Bassong made his Canaries debut against Queens Park Rangers in a 1–1 draw at Carrow Road.

However, Bassong missed the start of the 2013–14 Premier League season after suffering an injury just before the start of pre-season. He played in developmental games and a League Cup fixture against Bury to get back to match fitness. On 31 August 2013, he returned against Southampton and helped the team keep a clean sheet as they beat the Saints 1–0. Since returning to the first team from injury, Bassong regained his first team place, establishing himself in the centre–back position. However, against Manchester City on 2 November 2013, he was the captain in the match that saw Norwich City lost 7–0, leading him to be dropped to the bench for the next match. Bassong then returned to the starting lineup for Norwich City, without the captaincy, where he helped the side beat Crystal Palace 1–0 on 30 November 2013. On 12 December 2013, he signed a new contract with the club, keeping him until 2016. Three days after that, Bassong returned as the club's captain against Swansea City, where he made a mistake that led to Nathan Dyer, as the game finished 1–1. Later in the 2013–14 season, his performance in number of matches was soon a subject of criticism from the club's supporters and pundits. As a result, he was dropped from the first team for the rest of the season. However, Norwich were relegated that season along with Cardiff City and Fulham. This was his third relegation from the Premier League with a third different club. At the end of the 2013–14 season, Bassong made thirty appearances in all competitions.

Ahead of the 2014–15 season, Bassong was challenged by new Manager Neil Adams to fight for his first team place. Bassong switched number shirt to thirty. However, at the start of the 2014–15 season, he fell out of favour in the first team by Manager Neil Adams. After his loan spell at Watford came to an end, Bassong was given a chance to return to the first team by Manager Alex Neil.

He started the whole game in the Championship play-off Final against Middlesbrough, as Norwich City beat them 2–0 to secure promotion to play in Premier League football next season. Reflecting to the 2014–15 season, he praised Manager Neil for giving him a first team chance since returning.

Having received first team football under the management of Alex Neil since the start of the 2015–16 season, Bassong credited him for putting his football career back on track.

Gaëtan Bong

Thomas Gaëtan Bong (born 25 April 1988) is a Cameroonian professional footballer who plays as a defender for Championship club Nottingham Forest and the Cameroon national team. He previously played at senior level for Metz, Tours, Valenciennes, Olympiacos, Wigan Athletic and Brighton & Hove Albion and represented France at under-21 level, before switching to his native Cameroon.

Bong was born in Sackbayeme, Centre Region. He began his career in the youth side for Metz at age fourteen, having started out at La Madine Training Centre. Having initially played in the "left wing" position, Bong switched to the left–back, a position he played today.

Bong was part of the FC Metz youth side when he helped the team win the 25th edition of the "Mondial de la Saint-Pierre" by beating FC Nantes on penalties on 22 April 2002. While progressing the youth team, Olivier Perrin commented about Bong, saying: "He's a real competitor. He still has a lot of work to do, especially on the technical side. Physically, he is able to repeat high-level efforts. But its main quality is to succeed in making the most of its potential." In July 2005, he was one of the four players to receive the BEP LEC following his exam results.

In October 2005, Bong suffered an injury during training that required stitches. Two months later, he was called up to the first team for the first time at age seventeen. Bong made his FC Metz debut against Sochaux on 10 December 2005, starting the whole game, in a 1–1 draw. He appeared two more matches later in the 2005–06 season.

Born in Malanje, Portuguese Angola, Jordão made his professional debut in 1990 for Lisbon-based C.F.

Campomaiorense and Leça FC, both in the second division (he also did not manage to appear regularly for the former).

After two solid seasons at Estrela, Jordão joined Primeira Liga club S.L. Benfica, but was soon deemed surplus to requirements following the arrival of Graeme Souness as manager, and moved to fellow league team S.C. Braga in January 1998, where he would spend an additional two campaigns.

Jeff Bourne

Jeffrey Albert Bourne (19 June 1948 – 31 July 2014) was an English footballer who played as a striker. Born in Linton, Derbyshire, he spent most of his early career in the lower English divisions before moving to the United States where he played six seasons in the North American Soccer League, two in the second division American Soccer League. He led the ASL in scoring in 1983.

Bourne began his career with non league club Burton Albion before signing with Derby County in February 1971. He saw limited time with the first team, playing mostly with the reserves until January 1974. He finished the 1973-1974 season with nine goals as Derby County finished third in the standings. He found himself back with the reserves the next season, with occasional stretches of first team. In 1975, he was part of the team that won the First Division, contributing 17 appearances and 2 goals. In 1976, Derby County loaned Bourne to the Dallas Tornado of the North American Soccer League (NASL). When it became apparent that Bourne would never be more than a sporadic player with the club, Derby County sold his contract to Crystal Palace F.C. for £30,000 in March 1977. At the time that Bourne joined Crystal Palace the team was in a free fall. They had slipped from the top division to the third in two seasons and appeared in danger of falling further. Crystal Palace had just sold Paul Hammond to the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the NASL. They then used the cash to purchase Bourne. Bourne made an immediate impact, scoring nine goals in fifteen games and helping Crystal Palace return to the Second Division. Despite his contribution, Bourne was considered a poor long term investment and he was sent to the Dallas Tornado in the spring of 1978.

Bourne first played in the United States when he came to the Dallas Tornado of the North American Soccer League on loan from Derby County in 1976. He scored fifteen goals in twenty-two games earning second team All Star honors. In 1978, Dallas purchased his contract from Crystal Palace. In 1979, the Tornado traded Bourne to the Atlanta Chiefs for the first round in the 1979 College Draft. Bourne scored eighteen goals in twenty-nine games for the Chiefs in 1979, but his production dropped to five goals in twenty games in 1980. As a result, the Chiefs sent Bourne to the Seattle Sounders where he finished the season with two goals in eight games. That winter, Bourne was one of the top players during the NASL indoor season, scoring twenty-one goals in seventeen games. Bourne played the 1981 season, his last in the NASL, with Seattle. In the fall of 1981, he signed with the Wichita Wings of the Major Indoor Soccer League. In the 1981-1982 season, he twenty goals. In 1982, he signed on loan from the Wings to the Oklahoma City Slickers of the American Soccer League. The Slickers went to the championship series where it fell to the Detroit Express. Bourne then returned to the Wings for the 1982-1983 indoor season. The Slickers attempted to acquire him for the 1983 ASL season, but the Wings asking price was too high and Bourne signed with the Dallas Americans. He led the league in scoring with seventeen goals. He returned to the Wings and was the league's second leading scorer when he suffered a season-ending injury in April 1984. There are also indications that he may have played in the United Soccer League in 1984.

Bourne died on 31 July 2014 from motor neurone disease, having only been diagnosed with the disease nine weeks previously.

He also played cricket for Northamptonshire and was an English cricket umpire.

Walden was born in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire and after playing football for various clubs in his home town, he started his professional career in 1909 at Northampton Town, then playing in the Southern League.

On 13 April 1913, he was transferred to Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of £1,700. Being only 5 ft 2 in tall he was often described as a 'diminutive winger' and known for his 'darting jinking runs down the right flank'. 
His small stature also accounted for his nickname 'Fanny' which was in common use during his time to describe those of 'dainty physique'.

He continued to play for Tottenham after the enforced break caused by the First World War, during which he served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Air Force. He made his most important contribution for Spurs in the team which won the Second Division title in 1920 but the following year unfortunately missed the 1921 FA Cup Final due to injury. He went on to play in over 300 games for Spurs including 214 league games (scoring 21 goals) and 22 FA Cup matches (3 goals) before leaving the club in July 1924. He returned to Northampton Town to finish his career in the 1926–27 season.

Walden won his first of two England Caps on 4 April 1914 against Scotland. The second, on 13 March 1922, was against Wales. Unsurprisingly, he holds the record for being the smallest ever footballer to represent England at national level.

Walden played Cricket at county level for Northamptonshire between 1910 and 1929. A right-handed batsman scoring over 7538 runs and slow right-hand bowler taking 119 wickets in 258 matches.

After retiring from playing he became an umpire standing in 212 First Class matches between 1930 and 1939 and 11 test matches from 1934 (England v Australia at Old Trafford) until 1939 (England vs West Indies at Lord's). He stood with Frank Chester at The Oval in 1938 during England's record Ashes victory of an innings and 579 runs.

Walden died in Northampton age 61, on 3 May 1949.

Modibo Maïga

Modibo Maïga (born 3 September 1987) is a Malian footballer who plays as a striker for Mali national team. He has also played for Stade Malien, Raja Casablanca, Le Mans, Sochaux, West Ham United, Queens Park Rangers and Metz. A full international for Mali since 2007, he was part of their squads at the four Africa Cup of Nations tournaments, helping them to third place in the 2012 and 2013 editions.

Born in Bamako, Maïga began his career with Stade Malien in his home country aged 15 in 2003, later moving to Moroccan club Raja CA Casablanca where he spent his late teenage years, winning several competitions, including the Arab Champions League and the Moroccan League.

Maïga made a move to French Ligue 1 side Le Mans aged 20 in 2007. Playing alongside Gervinho and Stéphane Sessègnon, Maïga established himself in French football. Despite Le Mans' relegation to Ligue 2, Maïga scored 15 goals in 88 games. He signed a four-year contract in 2010 with Sochaux and took the number 15 shirt.

During the 2010–11 campaign, Maïga struck up a 30-goal partnership with Brown Ideye, each scoring 15 goals. Between them, they scored over half of Sochaux's league goals. Maïga and Brown were assisted by playmaking duo Marvin Martin and Ryad Boudebouz as Sochaux qualified for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League.

On 12 August 2011, Maïga announced to his club that he would never again play for Sochaux because he wanted a transfer to Newcastle United. He refused to play against Caen and Nancy, but opted to play against Metalist Kharkiv and Lorient. He and teammate Kévin Anin were refused a move away from the club and were later criticised by supporters, who temporarily withdrew their support in response to poor performances and the attitude of Anin and Maïga.

On 18 October, several newspapers, including "The Daily Telegraph" and "L'Equipe", reported that Maïga was close to a deal to move to Newcastle in the January 2012 transfer window and on 13 December, it was reported that he had passed a medical in London ahead of his move, with the transfer fee believed to be in the region of £7 million. On 16 December, however, "L'Equipe" reported that Maïga had failed his medical with Newcastle.

On 17 July 2012, after playing out the remander of the 2011–12 season with Sochaux, Maïga underwent a medical at West Ham United. He signed the following day on a four-year contract with an option for a further two years, at an undisclosed fee. Maïga made his debut for West Ham on 18 August 2012, coming on as an 81st-minute substitute for Carlton Cole in a 1–0 home win against Aston Villa.

On 28 August, Maïga scored on his full home debut against Crewe Alexandra in the second round of the League Cup to make the score 2–0 following Nicky Maynard's opening goal. He scored his first league goal on 20 October against Southampton in a 4–1 win at Upton Park. His only other league goals for West Ham in his first two seasons with the club came in a 3–1 win against Chelsea—West Ham's first against the club since 2003, on 1 December 2012—and in a 3–3 draw with West Bromwich Albion, with a 20-yard shot on 20 December 2013. On 18 December 2013, Maïga scored the winning goal for West Ham in a 2–1 away win against rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup, marking his first goal in over a year for the club. His form brought criticism from some West Ham supporters but he was defended and praised for his most recent efforts by then-manager Sam Allardyce.

He returned to the West Ham squad from his season-long loan with Metz for the beginning of the 2015–16 season. He played in four of West Ham's six 2015–16 Europa League qualifying games, against Birkirkara and Astra Giurgiu, without scoring. On 9 August, he played in his first Premier League game of the season, coming on as a 90th-minute substitute for Diafra Sakho in a 2–0 away win against Arsenal. In the third Premier League game of the season, on 22 August against AFC Bournemouth, Maïga scored West Ham's third goal in a 3–4 defeat in what was to be his last game for the club.

On 31 January 2014, Maïga joined Queens Park Rangers on loan for the remainder of the 2013–14 season. He made his debut on 1 February in a draw against Burnley. Coming on as a 68th-minute substitute for Andrew Johnson, Maïga scored in the 79th minute to make the score 3–3, the final score. It was his only goal for QPR.

In August 2014, Maïga joined French club Metz on a season-long loan with an option to make the loan a permanent transfer in the summer of 2015. He scored his debut goals for Metz on 1 November, scoring twice in a 3–2 home win against Caen. On 4 April 2015, Maïga scored a hat-trick for Metz as they defeated Toulouse 3–2. Maïga scored nine league goals in 25 games for Metz whilst on loan, while they finished 19th in Ligue 1 and were relegated to Ligue 2.

In August 2015, Maïga signed a two-year contract for Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr for an undisclosed fee.

In October 2016, Maïga signed for UAE Arabian Gulf League club Al-Ittihad Kalba after his release from Al-Nassr in July 2016.

In September 2017, Maïga signed for UAE Arabian Gulf League club Ajman for a free transfer.

Maïga plays for Mali, making his debut on 17 November 2007 in a 2–3 friendly defeat to Senegal at the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir in Colombes, France, as a 59th-minute substitute for Souleymane Dembélé. His first goal came on 21 June 2009 in World Cup qualification, equalising in a 3–1 victory over Benin at the Stade du 26 Mars in Bamako. He wore the number 10 shirt at the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations, playing all three games of a group stage elimination in Angola.

He was called up again to the Mali squad for 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, but in February 2012 whilst in Gabon participating in the competition, he contracted malaria and was hospitalized in Libreville. He missed the remainder of the tournament, in which his nation came third. The following year, he again helped the team to the same position in the tournament.

At the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea, Maïga headed the equaliser in a 1–1 draw against Guinea in the final Group D game, but the opponents advanced on draw of lots.

John Paul Kissock

John Paul Kissock (born 2 December 1989) is an English association footballer who is player-assistant manager at Whitehawk. He plays as a midfielder.

Born in the north Liverpool suburb of Fazakerley, Kissock joined Premier League club Everton's youth system aged seven; progressing quickly, he began playing for England's under-16 team in November 2004, aged only 14. He appeared for England's under-18 side in September 2006, aged 16, and signed professionally for Everton on 12 December 2006. He became a regular player for the club's under-18 and reserve teams and was an unused substitute for the first team on numerous occasions. Following loan spells at Scottish Premier League club Gretna – for whom he made his professional debut on 9 February 2008 – and English fourth-tier side Accrington Stanley the following year, he was released by Everton at the end of the 2008–09 season.

Kissock briefly returned to Scotland at the start of the next season, joining Hamilton Academical in August 2009 but was let go by the club after three appearances in four months. He trialled at various English Football League clubs during the 2010–11 pre-season but failed to win a contract, leading him to begin the season playing for amateur side Newton in the eleventh-tier West Cheshire League. He transferred to ninth-level Formby in October 2010 and only two months after that moved up another four levels when he signed for Southport of the Conference Premier, having impressed the club's manager, Liam Watson. Kissock performed well for Southport during the second half of 2010–11, and after playing four matches in the 2011–12 season signed for Luton Town on 26 August 2011.

Born in Fazakerley, Liverpool, Kissock played for youth side Key Ways from the age of six and joined the academy of Premier League club Everton, his favourite team, a year later. At Key Ways he had played alongside Lee Molyneux, who joined Kissock in Everton's youth system in 2000, and Charlie Barnett, later an apprentice with Liverpool. While studying at Archbishop Beck High School, Kissock was first picked for the England under-16 team in November 2004, when he was aged 14, for a match against the under-16s' Scottish counterparts. He played for England under-16s three more times during 2005 and in April that year was voted Liverpool Young Sports Personality of the Year.

Over the following year Kissock became a regular player for Everton's under-18 and reserve sides. In the process he broke Wayne Rooney's record as the youngest ever player to play for Everton's reserve team and played for the England under-18 team against France in September 2006. He was called up to the first team for a UEFA Cup game against AZ in December 2007 but failed to make the final match day squad. During the 2007–08 season he joined the first-team squad for twelve Premier League games, but did not play. In January 2008 he joined Scottish Premier League club Gretna on loan until the end of the season, and it was for them that he made his professional debut in Gretna's 2–0 away defeat against Heart of Midlothian on 9 February 2008. He finished the season with 11 league appearances.

After returning to Everton, he appeared on the substitutes' bench regularly during the first half of the 2008–09 season, and was once again sent on loan in January 2009, this time for a month-long spell at English League Two club Accrington Stanley, where he made five appearances. After his release from Everton at the end of the season, Kissock returned to Scotland on 14 August 2009, when he signed for Scottish Premier League club Hamilton Academical. After joining Hamilton, Kissock says his departure from Everton left him in tears, having support Everton and spending twelve at the club and that Hamilton saved his football career However, only four months and three matches for Hamilton, he was released on 3 December 2009.

During the 2010–11 pre-season, Kissock had trials with League One clubs Brighton & Hove Albion and Milton Keynes Dons but failed to win a contract with either. He started the season playing for his brother's team Newton F.C. in the eleventh-tier West Cheshire League, before swiftly moving up two divisions with a transfer to North West Counties League club Formby in October 2010. He immediately showed prowess, scoring in each of his first two games, one with a shot from inside his own half; these goals drew the attention of Liam Watson, manager of Conference Premier club Southport, who brought Kissock to his club in December 2010. The new signing made his first appearance for Southport on 28 December in a match against Fleetwood Town, and scored his first goal for the club in their 5–1 victory over Gateshead on 3 January 2011, also winning the man-of-the-match award. In the words of "Liverpool Echo" journalist Philip Kirkbride, Kissock was an "instant hit", performing well throughout the rest of the season while the team struggled while battling relegation. Despite their improvement since the addition of Kissock, Southport ended the season in the relegation zone; however, they remained in the division as a result of Rushden & Diamonds' expulsion in June 2011 for financial reasons. Having finished 21st out of the 24 teams, in the highest of the four relegation spots, they were retained in Rushden's place.

Kissock started the 2011–12 season with four appearances for Southport and scored the team's first goal of the season in their first match of the season, against Lincoln City on 13 August 2011. A week later he set up Jonathan Brown for the opening goal in the team's 5–1 away loss against Luton Town, and on 24 August he was called up to the England C team, a national squad made up of non-League players. Two days later he joined Luton, signing a two-year contract. As well as paying an undisclosed transfer fee, his new team loaned two players to Southport as part of the deal, lending them midfielder Godfrey Poku and forward Dan Walker until January 2012. Kissock first appeared for his new club on 27 August as a substitute in a 3–1 win over Braintree Town, and made his first start on 2 September in a 1–1 draw away against Stockport County. He played well, especially in the latter, and received a strongly positive reception from Luton fans.

Having already scored against Lincoln for Southport on the opening day of the season, Kissock appeared against them for the second time in two months on 17 September when Luton were pitted against them at Kenilworth Road. Kissock came off the bench after 67 minutes with the game goalless and was instrumental in Luton's eventual victory. With six minutes left to play, standing near the left-hand corner of the penalty area and the goal line, he received a short corner from Adam Watkins. Kissock twisted past a Lincoln defender, and turning quickly, ran towards the net along the byline; from a tight angle he crossed the ball low for forward Stuart Fleetwood, who was waiting in the middle of the six-yard box. In the words of the official club match report, Fleetwood "couldn't miss" from such short range; he prodded the ball home to score the only goal of the game. Mark Wood's match report for "The Luton News" called Kissock's assist "a moment of magic"; "wonderfully inventive".

Kissock was called into the England C team once again in November 2011 and made his debut in a 3–1 loss to Gibraltar.

On 21 January 2012 Kissock returned to Southport for the first time since leaving them for the Hatters, making his first league start since late September for Luton Town. Kissock was substituted after 63 minutes, he reacted badly to the manager's intervention and the pair conducted an altercation in the dugout. Luton Town manager Gary Brabin explained after the match that his decision to substitute Kissock was tactical and he also felt John looked a little jaded from his excellent performance in the Hatters previous game. Gary Brabin went on to say that Kissock's behaviour was "Disrespectful to me, to his team mates, also to the fans and the club"

On 9 July 2012, Kissock joined Conference Premier newcomers Macclesfield Town on loan until January 2013. His transfer was then made permanent in January for cash plus Arnaud Mendy deal.

On 30 January 2014, Oldham Athletic signed Kissock on loan until the end of the season with a view to a permanent move. Upon arrival, Oldham Athletic manager Lee Johnson stated "JP is an interesting one, he is someone I have followed for a long time I have always thought he was a really good player. It may appear to be an unfashionable signing, but sometimes as a manager you have to weigh up the value, age, pedigree and talent and take a chance. This is such an occasion". Kissock was delighted with the move and said "It's an unbelievable opportunity that the gaffer has offered me. To be back in the Football League after a few years in non-league is something I have worked hard for. I am delighted to be given this chance and I am really looking forward to being part of the squad".

Upon the end of his loan at the end of the season, Kissock had made 4 appearances for the club during an injury-ravaged spell.

Kissock left Macclesfield by mutual consent on 1 August 2014. Seven days later, he joined Conference South side Whitehawk.

He played for Ebbsfleet United before being released by the club in June 2017.

In July 2017 he re-joined Southport for his second spell with the club.

In June 2018 he joined Welling United.

In January 2019 he re-signed for Whitehawk of the Isthmian League Premier Division and was appointed player assistant manager for the start of the following season.

Kissock primarily plays as an attacking midfielder, though he has been known to play just behind the forward in the 'hole', acting as the offensive pivot to teams. Described by Kirkbride in April 2011 as Southport's "creative spark", club manager Liam Watson based his team's tactics around the Liverpudlian; the "Southport Visiter" wrote soon after Kissock's move to Luton that he had been "the creative force Southport looked to". Kissock's strengths lie in his technical ability, passing, always available for a pass and proficiency with both feet. Kissock's footballing inspirations are Argentine players Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi, the latter of whom he is compared to by Luton and Macclesfield supporters due to his skilful play and similar appearance.

Rostyn Griffiths

Rostyn John Griffiths (born 10 March 1988) is an Australian professional footballer currently playing for Melbourne City FC. Griffiths is a former captain of another A-League club, Perth Glory. In August 2017 it was announced that Griffiths had signed a lucrative deal as a defensive midfielder for Uzbekistan giants Pakhtakor Tashkent in the Uzbek League. 

One of the most expensive signings in A-League history, the big defending-midfielder has always been a standout player in the A-League. Griffiths is renowned for his ability to break up the opposition’s gameplay and being the central figure to his team’s build-up play. 

Griffiths starred for Central Coast Mariners from 2010 until he moved to Chinese club Guangzhou R&F in 2012. That departure attracted a $1.3 million transfer fee which remains an A-League record.

Born in Stoke-on-Trent, England, Griffiths started his youth career with Australian club ECU Joondalup before moving to England to play for Blackburn Rovers where he never made a senior appearance but during the time he spent at Blackburn he joined Gretna on loan in January 2008. where he made his debut for the side against Heart of Midlothian in February.

He signed a one-year deal with Blackburn in January 2008 and was sent on loan to Accrington Stanley for the remainder of his contract.

On 3 February 2009 he was signed as an injury replacement player by A-League club Adelaide United. With the initial agreement only covering a four-week stint, there is an option to extend that to a two-year contract. However, it is a permanent deal, and not a loan.

On 2 July 2009, it was announced that Griffiths would join A-League club North Queensland Fury for their inaugural season. On 8 August 2009 he started in Fury's first A-league match and scored the Fury's first ever goal in a competitive match against Sydney FC.

On 29 February 2012 it was announced that he had signed for Chinese Super League club Guangzhou for a fee that was undisclosed at the time, but later revealed to be $1.3 million, a record sum for an Australian transfer.

On 23 January 2014 it was announced that Griffiths returned to the A-League, signing with Perth Glory.

On 4 December 2014, Griffiths scored his first goal of the 2014–15 season against Sydney FC in the 84th minute before Andy Keogh scored in the 86th minute to earn a late 2–1 comeback.

On 26 July 2015, Perth Glory released Griffiths to allow him to sign a two-year deal with newly promoted Eredivise club Roda JC. Following struggles for game-time, Griffiths left Roda JC after one season on 19 April 2016.

On 24 July 2016, Griffiths returned once more to the A-League, signing a two-year deal with Perth Glory after trialling with them on their Philippines Tour. On 2 October 2016, he was announced as captain of the club.

On 1 August 2017, Perth Glory announced that Griffiths would be leaving the club with immediate effect to join Uzbek League side Pakhtakor Tashkent. Griffiths left Pakhtakor in May 2018, citing family reasons.

On 19 July 2018, Griffiths signed a two-year deal with Melbourne City, joining the club well before the start of the 2018/19 season.

Griffiths has played for Australia's National under 17 team, and scored a brace on his debut against Tonga. While he was still playing for Blackburn, he was courted by Wales' national teams, due to a Welsh link on his Grandfather's side but, at that point, had not yet decided on his international allegiance.

His younger brother, Brent Griffiths is also a professional footballer who last played for Penang in the Malaysia Super League. The brothers were together, during their stints in the youth set up of English Premier League side, Blackburn Rovers.

He has played for France at under-21 level.

Grandin began his career at his hometown club, Stade Malherbe Caen. He made his debut for the first team in the 2004–05 season, making just one substitute appearance, on 28 May 2005 in a 3–2 defeat to Istres as Caen were relegated from Ligue 1 to Ligue 2. In the 2005–06 season Caen finished fourth in Ligue 2, missing out on promotion to Ligue 1 on goal difference. Grandin made a total of nineteen league appearances, scoring three goals.

The following season he was part of the Caen squad that finished as runners-up and won promotion to Ligue 1. He made 23 appearances, scoring twice. In the 2007–08 season he made twelve appearances, scoring one goal.

He made a total of 55 league appearances for Caen, scoring six goals.

That season he made eight league appearances, most of them as a substitute. In his first match against AS Monaco in the last 16 of the Coupe de France, he made an assist for the second goal scored by Mathieu Valbuena. On 17 May, the last day of the season against Strasbourg, he came on as a substitute after an injury to striker Mamadou Niang, and sent his pass set up to Nasri to score as Marseille won 4–3 and so qualified for the preliminary round of the Champions League.

In his second season, Grandin was in the starting line-up in the first game of the season at Stade Rennais, scoring Marseilles 4th goal in stoppage time, in a 4–4 draw. On 13 August he made his European debut in the third qualifying round of the Champions League, in a single-goal victory at Norwegian side Brann.

In the 2008–09 season he made a further eight appearances, scoring twice. Grandin then fell out of favour into the plans of Eric Gerets and lack of playing time in Marseille.

After returning to France, Marseille released Grandin from his contract on 2 September.

On 5 January 2010, he was reportedly in negotiations with Romanian Liga I club Rapid Bucharest, and was believed to be about to sign for the club; however, on 20 January he signed an 18-month contract with Bulgarian A PFG club CSKA Sofia, after they gave him an improved offer that gave him 30% of any future sale proceeds.

He made his competitive debut for CSKA on 13 March against Sportist Svoge, scoring the opening goal and providing an assist in a 4–1 win. He made a total of ten league appearances, scoring four goals in the 2009–10 season as CSKA finished second.

Four days later he played in a 2–1 win over Northern Irish IFA Premiership side Cliftonville at Windsor Park, Belfast, in the Third qualifying round of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. It was to be his last appearance for "the Reds".

On 11 August 2010, Grandin signed for newly promoted Premier League club Blackpool on a two-year deal, with the option for a third year. He spoke positively of manager Ian Holloway's personality and tactics.

Three days after signing, he made his debut as Blackpool made their bow in the Premier League with a 4–0 win over Wigan Athletic at the DW Stadium. On 12 February 2011, Grandin scored his first goal for the club in a 1–1 home draw with Aston Villa. 

Following Blackpool's relegation to the Championship after one season, Grandin suffered an injury on his toe that kept him out for four weeks. After missing 17 games through injury, Grandin made his return against Barnsley in a 3–1 win. In January 2012, Grandin scored his first goals of the 2011–12 season, against Ipswich Town and Crystal Palace. 

Grandin returned to his native country by signing a season-long loan deal with OGC Nice on 28 January 2012. Grandin made his debut on 4 February 2012 in a 1–1 draw against Ajaccio, the first of 13 appearances in all competitions; the club did not take up the option to make his move permanent and he returned to Blackpool.

In the 2012–13 season, Grandin return to Blackpool after Nice failed to sign him on a permanent basis. In his second appearance of the season, on 18 September 2012, he won a penalty and converted it himself, in a 4–1 win over Middlesbrough. Subsequently though, Grandin was not included for five matches, after scoring his first goal, and trained with the club’s development squad. Manager Holloway explained his reason for leaving out Grandin as being a bad attitude. Grandin then stated he never wanted to leave Blackpool and loves the city of Blackpool. Upon his returning to the squad, Grandin quickly scored goals in consecutive games, against Nottingham Forest and Brighton & Hove Albion. But the departure of Holloway led to reduced first team opportunities.

As the 2012–13 season proceeded, Grandin was an unused substitute for the remainder of the matches played. At the end of the 2012–13 season, Grandin was released by the club.

In August 2013, Holloway's new club Crystal Palace signed Grandin from Blackpool on a free transfer. He made his debut on 27 August, in a 2–1 defeat against Bristol City in the second round of the League Cup.

In January 2014, Grandin's contract was cancelled by mutual consent, under the management of Tony Pulis, without having made a league appearance.

On 6 February 2014, Grandin returned to Blackpool on a deal until the end of the 2013–14 season after leaving Crystal Palace at the end of January. Following his return, Grandin said moving back to Blackpool felt like home and also that interim manager Barry Ferguson played a role of giving him a chance.

Grandin re-debuted for the club, where he came on for Ángel Martínez, in the 67th minute, as Blackpool and Nottingham Forest drew 1–1 on 8 February 2014. Grandin then scored his first goal for the club, as Blackpool lost 2–1 to Yeovil Town on 5 April 2014.

At the end of the season, Grandin was released by the club after they decided not to offer him a new contract. Following his departure from Blackpool, he was linked with a move to Championship clubs, including a return to Blackpool.

After playing in Romania for Astra Giurgiu, Grandin returned to England, signing for Shrewsbury Town in League One on a short-term deal until the end of the season in February 2016. He was released without making a first team appearance.

Grandin then played in Cyprus for Ermis Aradippou FC before returning to France with Étoile Fréjus Saint-Raphaël of the Championnat National 2 (fourth tier) in January 2018. The following year he moved to JS Saint-Pierroise of Réunion, and was part of their team on 4 January 2020 that won 2–1 away to Niort to become the second "Outre-Mer" club to reach the last 32 of the Coupe de France, and first since French Guianan champions ASC Le Geldar in 1989.

On 31 January 2020, the last day of the 2019–20 winter transfer period, Grandin returned to England joining League Two side Grimsby Town F.C. until the end of the season to link up with former manager Ian Holloway.

In 2005, Grandin was part of the French youth squad that won the Meridian Cup in Turkey. He made three appearances, scoring one goal for France under-21s in 2008.

Joe Partington

Joseph Michael Partington (born 1 April 1990) is a professional footballer who plays as a defender for National League side Eastleigh.
At under-21 level, Partington represented Wales on eight occasions between 2009 and 2012.

Born in Portsmouth, Partington joined AFC Bournemouth in June 2006 after being released by Portsmouth. He made his first team debut for Bournemouth on 9 February 2008, against Luton Town. Bournemouth won the game 4–1. Partington came on as a late substitute for Marvin Bartley.

On 5 April, Partington scored his first professional goal. This was a crucial goal at the Liberty Stadium in the 90th minute against top of the league side Swansea City. Moments after, Bournemouth scored another goal from Jo Kuffour to win the game 2–1. The goal scored against Swansea when he was 18 years 4 days old means he is currently the youngest player to score for Bournemouth in their history.

On 7 May, Bournemouth manager Kevin Bond announced he had offered Partington, along with youth team goalkeeper Ryan Pryce and winger Josh McQuoid a professional contract with the club. Partington made his full first team début against Bury on 20 December, scoring Bournemouth's second goal of the game in the 44th minute.

On 29 October 2010, Partington joined Eastbourne Borough of the Conference National on an initial one-month's loan in order to gain some first team experience.

The then Bournemouth manager Lee Bradbury offered Partington a new and improved two-and-a-half year contract on 4 February 2011 which he accepted. This will keep him at the club until the end of the 2012–13 season.

Partington's contract was extended by a further two years in June 2013 by current manager Eddie Howe who has stated that he is keen for Partington to convert to a centre half. To assist him in this on 1 January 2014 he signed for Conference Premier team Aldershot Town on a month's loan after turning down two League clubs who wanted to sign him as a central midfielder. He suffered an injury in a match against Dartford which required an operation to reconstruct his knee and kept him out for ten months.

Partington signed for Eastleigh in January 2015, after recovering from a knee injury, on an initial one-month loan, which was extended until the end of the 2014–15 season.

On 4 June 2015, Partington joined Eastleigh on a free transfer on a two-year deal after Bournemouth released him. On 25 July 2016 Eastleigh manager Chris Todd persuaded Partington to sign an extension to his contract that will keep him at the club until July 2018. Partington was also made captain of the first team for the 2016/17 season. This came after the fans of the club and his teammates presented him with all four of the 2015/16 end of season awards.

On 13 January 2017, Partington joined League One side Bristol Rovers for an undisclosed fee, although Eastleigh stated that the fee that they received for Partington was a new club record. He made his debut for the club replacing Mark McChrystal in the second half of a 3-1 defeat to Fleetwood Town.

He was offered a new contract by Bristol Rovers at the end of the 2018–19 season.

On 13 June 2019, Partington returned to Eastleigh after rejecting a new contract at Bristol Rovers to allow him to focus on a new business, providing fitness camps for footballers in Hampshire.

Partington chose to play for Wales, qualifying through his Welsh mother. He made his debut for the Wales under-19 team in July 2007 against Chile. Aged only 17 years and 4 months he was made captain of the Welsh under-19 team for the game against Turkey in the Milk Cup and has captained his country at this level nine times since. His first Welsh goal came in a 3–1 defeat against Hungary.

On 2 February 2009, Partington was called up to the Wales under-21 squad for the first time by manager Brian Flynn for a friendly against Northern Ireland on 10 February. Because the match was cancelled, he made his under-21 debut on 31 March 2009 against Luxembourg at Llanelli's Parc y Scarlets. Partington captained the Welsh under-21s for the first time on 17 November 2010 in a 1–0 win against Austria.

Sean Connelly

Sean Patrick Connelly (born 26 June 1970, in Sheffield) is an English former professional footballer, currently working as a physio at Cardiff City and the Wales national football team.

Connelly qualified as a Chartered Physiotherapist in 1993 and began his football career at his local side Hallam before Stockport County manager Danny Bergara offered him a professional contract at the club, one that he accepted on finishing his degree in physiotherapy. He helped Stockport to the semi finals of the 1996-97 League Cup, beating Premier League teams Blackburn Rovers, West Ham United and Southampton en route. In the semi finals they faced another Premier League team in Middlesbrough. Boro won the first leg 2-0 at Edgeley Park. In the second leg at the Riverside, Connelly gave Stockport an early lead. However they were unable to score again and lost 2-1 in aggregate. His impressive form even generated rumours of a possible move to Liverpool, although this failed to materialise.
The defender played under four different managers during his nine-year stay at Stockport – Bergara, Dave Jones, Gary Megson and Andy Kilner. He eventually left in 2001 after former manager Jones persuaded him to join him at Wolves. In 2002, he was inducted into the Stockport County hall of fame.

He signed permanently for Wolves after an initial loan spell in Spring 2001. However, he struggled to hold down a regular first team place during the following season at Molineux and was allowed to join Tranmere Rovers in October 2002.

He quickly established himself at Tranmere and was a regular for two years before manager Brian Little decided against offering him a new contract, whereupon he moved to Rushden & Diamonds, where he finished his playing career.

After leaving Rushden & Diamonds he linked up with Dave Jones again, this time as physio at Cardiff City, turning down offers to continue playing in order to take the job.

Ian Howat (born 29 July 1958) is a Welsh former professional footballer who played in The Football League for Chester and Crewe Alexandra. He later appeared for several non-league clubs.

A product of Chester's youth policy, Howat made his Chester debut as a substitute in a Football League Third Division fixture against Mansfield Town on 16 October 1976. Later in the season he scored twice during the club's run to the FA Cup fifth round and netted the winner against Port Vale in the Debenhams Cup final at the end of the season. In his time at the club, Howat had spells playing in attack alongside fellow forwards including Paul Crossley, Ian Edwards, Ian Mellor, Peter Henderson, Ian Rush and Trevor Phillips without establishing himself as a first-team regular. He memorably found the target when Chester won 2–1 at Wrexham in April 1978, ending his hometown club's unbeaten home league record.

In February 1982 Howat moved to Crewe Alexandra, but left the club at the end of the season. This marked the end of his Football League career and Howat joined Bangor City in the Alliance Premier League. His spell with Bangor included an appearance at Wembley Stadium in May 1984 in the FA Trophy final against Northwich Victoria.

A cartlidge operation the following season ruled Howat out of action for a couple of years, but he subsequently returned to play for Welsh non-league sides Oswestry Town, Bangor City (second spell), Caernarfon Town, Newtown, Holywell Town and Llansantffraid. His achievements in later years included scoring 17 times in the first season of the League of Wales for Holywell.

Jesús García Sanjuán

Jesús García Sanjuán (born 22 August 1971) is a Spanish retired footballer who played mostly as a central midfielder.

Best known for his spell with Real Zaragoza, he helped it win the 1995 Cup Winners' Cup, then finished his professional career in Scotland where he represented two clubs.

A youth product of Real Zaragoza, Sanjuán was born in Zaragoza, and made his debut for the first team on 24 April 1991 in a 0–1 away loss against Sporting de Gijón. Almost never an undisputed starter for the Aragonese, he featured heavily during his seven-and-a-half professional seasons with the club, most notably amassing totals of 93 games and four goals in La Liga from 1991 to 1994.

The peak of Sanjuán's time with Zaragoza was winning the 1995 Cup Winners' Cup, in a 2–1 extra time win over Arsenal in Paris – he played 36 minutes in the final, as a substitute. The previous campaign, he had won the Copa del Rey with the side, beating Celta de Vigo on penalties and also featuring from the bench.

Sanjuán had a brief loan spell at English First Division team Wolverhampton Wanderers during autumn 1997, making four league appearances. He also featured three times in that season's Football League Cup, scoring the winning goal at Fulham.

Being definitely released by Zaragoza in June 1998, Sanjuán also played in Spain with Villarreal CF and Córdoba CF. With the former, he faced top level relegation after losing the play-offs to Sevilla FC.

Sanjuán returned to the United Kingdom in 2000, with Scotland's Airdrieonians, as one of a series of Spanish players recruited by manager Steve Archibald. After eight months, amid spiralling financial problems, the club sold him to Kilmarnock where he played two Scottish Premier League seasons, now mostly in a sweeper position, before retiring in 2003; he scored his only goal for the latter in a 3–0 win over the former for the Scottish Cup, on 5 January 2002.

<doc id="15710412" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15710412" title="James Conlin">
James Conlin

James Conlin (6 July 1881 – 23 June 1917) was an English footballer who played as a left-sided winger.

Although born in England he spent most of his life in Scotland. He played club football for Falkirk, Albion Rovers, Bradford City, Manchester City, Birmingham City and Airdrieonians between 1899 and 1913. He represented the English national side once, in 1906, in a match against Scotland, and he was only the second player in British football to be transferred for a fee of £1,000. He retired from football in 1914 just prior to the outbreak of the First World War, and was subsequently killed in action on 23 June 1917 while serving his country in Flanders prior to the Third Battle of Ypres. He has no known remains or grave, his death being commemorated instead on the Nieuport Memorial, Arrondissement Veurne, West-Vlaanderen.

Conlin was a "fast and tricky" player; only 5 ft 5 inches tall, he could cross balls for the centre forwards as well as score goals himself. Born in Consett, County Durham, of a Scottish steel-working father and an English mother (Luke and Mary Ann Conlin), Jimmy and his three younger siblings were raised in the Lanarkshire area east of Glasgow often referred to as Old Monkland. He began his football career playing in the Lanarkshire North Western Junior Football League with Captain Colt's Rovers. From there he moved to league rivals Airdrie St. Margarets and then on to the Glasgow Junior Football League side, Cambuslang Hibernian. From Cambuslang Hibernian he joined Falkirk sometime in 1899, making his debut in a Falkirk District Football League match away at East Stirlingshire on 30 December 1899, a game which his new team lost 6–3. In his two seasons playing at Falkirk – who were at the time playing in both the Central Football Combination and the supplemental Falkirk District Football League – Conlin scored seven goals in 17 combined league appearances, and eleven goals in 25 appearances in all competitions.

On 14 March 1901, Conlin transferred from Falkirk to Albion Rovers (who played in the Scottish Football Combination League), at which point his career and national notoriety as a supremely talented left winger began to take off. At Rovers, Conlin won the Scottish Football Combination championship in both the 1901–02 and 1902–03 seasons, and these back-to-back titles also secured Rovers an election to the Scottish League Second Division in the following season (1903–04). Rovers also reached the now defunct Lanarkshire Cup Final on 15 March 1902, but lost this derby game 0–3 to Hamilton Academical. Once he was playing in the Second Division of the national league, Conlin caught the attention of scouts from a number of English clubs, and at the end of the 1903–04 season Conlin was transferred amid great controversy to Bradford City for a fee of £100, but only after the Bantams had been fined £50 by a joint committee of English and Scottish F.A. officials for making an 'illegal' approach for the player.

At the Valley Parade Conlin made his Second Division debut in a home team win against Burslem Port Vale on 24 September 1904. The Bantams finished eighth in their division that season, and in his second season with the club they finished eleventh. While at Bradford Conlin became the first City player ever to be sent off when he was dismissed during a 6–1 defeat at West Bromwich Albion on 11 November 1905. Conlin also became the Bantam's first England international on 7 April 1906, when Scotland beat England 2–1 in Glasgow in front of a 102,741 crowd, which set a world record for an international match attendance.

Another of the more notable events in Conlin's career occurred during his time at Valley Parade. He was at the centre of an infamous incident involving Manchester United's right full back, Bob Bonthron, in a 1–5 home defeat played on 10 February 1906 during the latter club's promotion season. Both players had a reputation as being combative players; Conlin was tricky and feisty and Bonthron strong and burly, and they repeatedly clashed during the game. Bonthron's continual rough treatment of Conlin enraged the home crowd with the result that after the game he was attacked by some of the home supporters and the United team was pelted with missiles as they left the stadium. This incident made national news headlines. Criminal charges followed against the perpetrators, and a subsequent F.A. inquiry resulted in the temporary closure of Bradford City's Valley Parade ground for the first two weeks of March 1906. During his two seasons playing for Bradford City, Conlin scored five goals in 61 league appearances, and a total of ten goals in 67 appearances in all competitions.

On 13 July 1906 Manchester City paid £1,000 to secure Conlin's services, which was only the second time in the game's history that such a large transfer fee had been paid. His debut for the Sky Blues, against Woolwich Arsenal on 1 September 1906, was a somewhat bizarre event as this first home fixture was played during a freak national heatwave. Played in temperatures of in the shade and in the direct sun, the match saw several Manchester City players retiring from the game due to heat exhaustion. At one point the home team was reduced to having only six men on the pitch. Conlin himself was one of two City players who collapsed from the heat during the first half. However, he gamely returned for the second period of play with a knotted handkerchief on his head to better protect himself from the sun, but was still unable to help his depleted side from losing 1–4. In Conlin's first season playing for Manchester City the club finished 17th in the First Division.

In Conlin's second season at Hyde Road the results were much better, with the club finishing third in the First Division. However, his third season at the club saw Manchester City finish 19th in Division One and get relegated. In his fourth season with the Sky Blues in 1909–10, Conlin was a Second Division championship winner as Manchester City immediately returned to the top flight. After five seasons in Manchester, his longest period at any club, in which he scored 28 goals in 161 league appearances for City, and a total of 30 goals in 175 appearances in all competitions, Conlin signed next for Birmingham City on 29 September 1911.

His stay at St Andrew's was plagued by injury and he only made 23 appearances for the Second Division club, scoring twice. On 30 July 1912, Conlin moved on again for a transfer fee of £150, this time returning to the area east of Glasgow where he was raised to play for Airdrieonians in the Scottish League Division One. This move wasn't all that he might have hoped for, and on 7 October he was fined £2 10s for failing to turn up for a game. A brief period of triumph followed this setback, with Conlin's team beating Dykehead 5–1 to lift the Lanarkshire Cup on 30 December 1912.

Conlin's off-field issues resurfaced and he failed to turn up for several training sessions. On 4 February 1913, after admitting to having a drinking problem, he was fined again and severely warned about his behaviour. This appears to have had little effect, because on 15 April 1913 Conlin was suspended "sine die" and transfer-listed by the club. On 13 August 1913 Conlin made his final club transfer, joining Broxburn United who had finished bottom of the Central Football League in the previous season. Broxburn United were a new club, formed in 1912 from an amalgamation of the small town's two major clubs, Broxburn and Broxburn Athletic, and with Conlin on board the team finished in mid-table in the 1913–1914 season, although it is unclear how much Conlin contributed to the team's achievement.

At the outbreak of the Great War, Conlin enlisted in Coatbridge with the Highland Light Infantry, serving in the 15th (Service) Battalion (1st Glasgow). During June 1917 this battalion was transferred to the Nieuport sector on the Belgium coast in readiness to support the British offensive at the Third Battle of Ypres (also known as Passchendaele). This is where Private Conlin (26447) died, leaving behind a wife and two small children.

Devine was born in Lochore. He began his career in junior football with Minto Rovers, Lochgelly Rangers and Lochgelly United, moving on to Raith Rovers in 1904 and then joining Heart of Midlothian. It was at Falkirk that he came to prominence, scoring 13 goals in 25 appearances in 1909–10. This earned him an international cap for Scotland, against Wales on 5 March 1910. Devine scored the only goal in a 1–0 win for Scotland, but he never played for the national side again. He also made one appearance for the Scottish League XI in that season, in a 3–2 win against the English Football League XI.

In April 1910 he moved south of the border to Bradford City, and was part of the side that won the 1911 FA Cup Final against Newcastle United. He stayed at Bradford for nearly three years before joining Woolwich Arsenal. He made his debut for Arsenal against Chelsea on 15 February 1913, and was part of the team that were relegated from the Football League First Division in 1912–13. He started the 1913–14 season as a regular, and scored the winner in Arsenal's first match at Highbury, a 2–1 victory over Leicester Fosse on 6 September 1913.

However, later that same season Devine was forced out of the side by Wally Hardinge, and left the club; he played 24 games for Arsenal, scoring five goals. He later played for Shelbourne, where he was a member of the Irish Gold Cup-winning team in 1915. He returned to Scotland and played for Cowdenbeath, Lochgelly United, and Dunfermline Athletic. After retiring he worked as a miner and a docker. He died in September 1964, aged 77.

Johnny Morrissey

John "Johnny" Morrissey (born 18 April 1940) is an English former footballer who played in the Football League for Liverpool, Everton and Oldham Athletic, and won the Football League Championship with Everton in both 1962-63 and 1969-70.

Morrissey was born in Liverpool, and began his football career as a junior with Liverpool, signing professional forms when he turned 17, and making his debut in September 1957. He played as an outside left, and was unable to dislodge Alan A'Court from that position in the first team.

In 1962 he "crossed the park" to join Everton for a fee of £10,000, sold without manager Bill Shankly's knowledge. He scored on his Everton debut, in the first league Merseyside derby in 11 seasons, which finished as a 2–2 draw, and went on to help the club to the First Division title in his first season.

He scored the goal in the semi-final that took Everton to the 1968 FA Cup Final, and played on the losing side in that match. In the 1969-70 season he helped Everton win the First Division for a second time playing the full 90 minutes in 41 of the 42 games and contributing 9 goals from the left-wing. In 10 years with Everton, Morrissey scored 50 goals from 314 games in all competitions. Despite his small stature Morrissey had a reputation as an uncompromising player, Jimmy Greaves once commenting that he "always got the retaliation in first!". Johnny Giles, however, whilst later recognising Morrissey's unflinching style, commented first on him: "Well Johnny Morrissey, first of all, was a top-class player. He was a terrific player."

He finished his career with a brief stay at Oldham Athletic, which brought his total of League appearances over the 300 mark. His son John had a successful career with Tranmere Rovers making 470 League appearance for them between 1985 and 1999.

Laurence Abrams

Laurence Robert Abrams (also spelt Lawrence and Abram) (14 May 1889 – 20 March 1966), often known as Lol Abrams, was an English professional footballer. During his career, he made over 250 appearances in the English Football League and Scottish Football League.

Born in Banks, Lancashire, near Southport, he began his career with Southport Central, becoming the club's youngest professional player after making his debut at sixteen. He moved to Colne Town in 1906 before joining Football League side Stockport County a year later.

In 1910, he moved to Scotland to sign for Hearts, helping the side win the East of Scotland Shield in his first season. His performances attracted attention from several clubs and, he eventually returned to England to join Chelsea where his career was interrupted by the First World War. He later made one appearance for Cardiff City before returning to Southport where he finished his professional career. He was described as playing in a "Scottish style" and was a strong tackler.

Although he never played an official match for England, he did represent the nation in one wartime international fixture.

Born in Banks, Lancashire, Abrams attended Churchtown School, helping the school football team win the Unwin Challenge Shield, a schools tournament in Southport. He began his professional career with Southport Central as an outside forward. Breaking into the first team at the age of sixteen during the 1905–06 season, he made his senior debut on 11 November 1905 in a 7–0 defeat to Manchester United Reserves. He scored his first senior goal in his second appearance, during a 3–0 victory over Oldham Athletic.

Soon after, Oldham approached Southport over signing Abrams but were rebuffed as Southport claimed they had not been informed within the required time. In order to ward off interest, Southport offered Abrams a professional contract, making him the youngest ever professional player in the history of the club. Southport also attempted to claim £18 compensation from Oldham over the approach. Although the club's claim was unsuccessful, Oldham were later fined £5 by the Lancashire Combination. In his first season, he made 23 appearances in all competitions, scoring six times. He left the club in May 1906 to sign for rival Lancashire Combination side Colne Town.

In April 1907, Abrams joined Football League Second Division side Stockport County, making his debut in a 1–1 draw with Gainsborough on 7 September 1907. He remained with the club for three years, making over 70 appearances.

On 30 December 1910, Abrams joined Scottish side Hearts for a fee of £650. He made his debut for the club the following day, during a 1–0 defeat to Third Lanark, and scored his first goal in his sixth appearance, during a 1–1 draw with Clyde in the Scottish Cup. On 11 April 1911, Abrams helped Hearts win the East of Scotland Shield after defeating Broxburn in the final. With the match held at 1–1 after 84 minutes, Abrams scored his second goal for the club to give his side a 2–1 lead. Two further late goals for Hearts saw the match finish 4–1. In September 1911, he won the Dunedin Cup with Hearts after defeating Ross County 1–0 in a second replay of the final, followed two 1–1 draws in the previous matches.

At Hearts, a reshuffle in the playing squad led Abrams to convert from an outside forward to a wing half. Described as "a player of the Scottish school", his performances for Hearts in his new position attracted considerable attention from English clubs, being scouted by Liverpool who sent John McKenna to see him play.

Abrams eventually transferred to Chelsea from Hearts in 1914 for £1000. Chelsea struggled to pay the transfer fee and Hearts later obtained a court order in August 1916 to enforce repayment of an outstanding sum of £750 but withdrew the action after Chelsea claimed the club would fold if the repayment was made. Hearts later dropped their claim against the club and the money was never paid.

He was a member of the Chelsea side that reached the FA Cup final in 1915 and he travelled to the final but did not play having suffered a twisted knee in the club's semi-final victory over Everton. During the First World War, he guested for three of his former clubs, Southport Central, Stockport County and Hearts, and also appeared for Liverpool for one match against Bolton Wanderers due to an injury crisis. He returned to Chelsea following the return of The Football League at the end of the hostilities, remaining at Stamford Bridge until 1920 having made a total of 49 appearances and scoring 7 goals in total. He joined newly elected Second Division side Cardiff City on a free transfer, reuniting with his former Stockport manager Fred Stewart. However, he made just one league appearance for the club on 30 August 1920 in a 0–0 draw with Clapton Orient, in the first league match played at Ninian Park.

He instead returned to his first club Southport, now members of the Football League Third Division, where he made over 50 appearances and was later appointed captain before finishing his professional career when his contract was cancelled in February 1923. Following his retirement from playing, he worked as a painter and decorator in Southport.

Although never capped at international level, Abrams did represent England in a Military International match held during the First World War, scoring one of his side's goals during a 4–3 victory over Scotland on 13 May 1916.

Peter Henderson (born 29 September 1952, Berwick-upon-Tweed) is an English former professional footballer who mainly played as a Winger. He played in The Football League for three clubs, with most of his appearances being made for Chester.

Henderson was 26 before he made his breakthrough into The Football League, when he joined Chester from Witton Albion in December 1978. He had previously spent time on the books of Manchester City without making a first-team appearance and worked as a teacher of physical education in Winsford.

The following season saw Chester reach the FA Cup fifth round, with Henderson opening the scoring in a shock 2–0 win at Newcastle United in round three. This goal was unfortunately missed by many travelling Chester fans as their train arrived late.

Henderson left Chester at the end of the season for Gillingham, but after an injury hit spell at Priestfield Stadium and a brief loan stint with Crewe Alexandra, he returned to Chester in December 1981. He left the club at the end of the season, playing his final Football League fixture in a 1–0 loss at home to Carlisle United on 19 May 1982.

Jonathan Brown (Welsh footballer)

Jonathan David Brown (born 17 April 1990) is a Welsh professional footballer and former Wales under-21 international who plays as a winger for USL Championship club Hartford Athletic.

Born in Bridgend, Brown attended the Archbishop McGrath School as a youngster. Brown also competed in various sports, including rugby and athletics and was the Welsh 100m champion at the 12–14 age group after taking part in the Welsh games.

Brown's father, Steve, was captain of the Wales youth rugby team between 1976–1977.

Brown was originally spotted by Liverpool scout Gwyn James but was unable to sign for the Merseyside club, due to a rule meaning youth players must sign with a team within one and a half hours of their home, so he recommended him to Cardiff City. Having worked his way through the youth system at Cardiff, Brown made his first team debut against Welshpool Town in the FAW Premier Cup where he scored the only goal of the game with a free-kick to send the Bluebirds into the semi-final, becoming the first Bridgend-born player to play for Cardiff since Billy Rees. He made his league debut for Cardiff on 12 February 2008 against Coventry City when he came off the bench in the closing minutes and made a second appearance later in the season, coming on as a substitute again during a 3–1 win over Blackpool. At the end of the season he was rewarded with a one-year deal at the club, his first professional contract. Brown was the latest in a long line of recent youth players to have broken into the first team with the Bluebirds such as Joe Ledley, Chris Gunter, Darcy Blake and Aaron Ramsey.

Having not made an appearance for Cardiff during the 2008–09 season, Brown joined Wrexham on a two-month loan deal. He made his debut on 29 November in a 2–1 win over Stevenage Borough, setting up Jefferson Louis to score Wrexham's first goal before being replaced after 88 minutes by Shaun Whalley. He scored his first goal for the club in his very next game when he scored in the 90th minute to give Wrexham a 2–1 win over Kettering Town. On Christmas Eve, Brown was involved in a road accident while travelling back to Wrexham. On his way back from South Wales, Brown's car overturned near Welshpool and he was forced to break one of the vehicles windows in order to escape. Brown kept the incident a secret from Wrexham manager Dean Saunders until after he had played against Barrow on boxing day two days later.

Having been a first team regular during his initial loan spell, in early January it was confirmed that his loan deal had been extended by one month and at the end of the January transfer window the two clubs agreed for the loan deal to last until the end of the season. After the extended deal was agreed, manager Dean Saunders praised the impact Brown had at the side since arriving at the North Wales side. In his next game for the club, Brown scored his fourth goal of the season when he scored direct from a free-kick as Wrexham won 3–2 over Grays Athletic. In total, Brown made 27 appearances in all competitions for the club, scoring four times before returning to Cardiff, where he was released.

Having spent time on trial at the club, in December 2009 he joined Australian A-League side Central Coast Mariners on a contract until the end of the 2009–10 season, with the option of a possible two-year deal. However, he was released at the end of the season without making an appearance for the first team.

Following a six-month spell at the Somerset club, Brown signed for Southport, on 2 July 2011, ready for the 2011–12 season. He made his competitive club debut on 13 August 2011 on the first day of the 2011–12 season. He signed for AFC Telford United on loan for the rest of the season on 31 January 2012.

Following his release from Southport, Brown joined Telford United on a permanent deal. Jon announced to the fans of Telford that he was leaving them to move to Thailand to play over there. He played his last game at home against Wrexham in a 0–2 loss.

Following a successful trial, Brown signed a three-month contract with Hereford United on 25 July 2013.

In 2016, Brown joined Bangladeshi club Abahani Limited Dhaka and won the Bangladesh Football Premier League in the same year. He scored his first goal in the AFC Cup on 4 April 2017 against Mohun Bagan A.C. of India.

On 30 January 2019, Brown joined USL Championship side Hartford Athletic ahead of their inaugural 2019 season.

Brown has been a regular at various youth levels for Wales and was part of the under-19 squad that took part in the Milk Cup in 2007. He made his under-21 debut against Malta U21 on 5 February 2008, scoring his first goal for the under-21 side on 31 March 2009 in a 5–1 win over Luxembourg.

James McKeown

James Karl McKeown (born 24 July 1989) is a professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Grimsby Town.

Born in Birmingham, McKeown began his career aged 15 with Coventry City and Walsall youth teams, but was unable to establish himself and departed two years later. He then joined Peterborough United; he spent time on loan with Kettering Town and Worcester City in 2007 prior to breaking into the Peterborough first team in 2008, however, his appearances where limited during his time there. McKeown was then loaned to Conference North side Boston United during the 2010–11 season where he made a total of 14 clean sheets in 18 games.

A sixth-month stint at Dutch semi-professional outfit RKSV Leonidas had led to a trial with Eredivisie side Willem II, however, his previous managers at Boston signed him for Grimsby Town; he was ever present in the starting XI and five years on helped Grimsby to win promotion out of the National League in 2015–16. McKeown has represented the Republic of Ireland at under-19 level.

McKeown started his career with Coventry City as an Under-10 striker in their youth system, he went on trial in goal and spent two years in their Under-11s before being released. He eventually moved on to Walsall in their Under-15s setup, but failed to make a first team appearances before his departure in 2007.

McKeown was signed by Peterborough United. He joined Conference North team Kettering Town on loan in August 2007 and made just one game on loan for Worcester City in October, in a 0–5 defeat against Hucknall Town, after being brought in on a month's loan as cover for Danny McDonnell.

On 9 February 2008 Mckeown made his first appearance for Peterborough United in League Two, coming on as a 76th-minute substitute for the injured Joe Lewis who was stretchered off following a nasty aerial collision. Mckeown signed a -year contract extension on 16 March 2009. The following season in League One he made one appearance on 2 May 2009 where he came off the bench in the 77th minute as Joe Lewis made way in the 2–2 draw with Swindon Town. Mckeown was sent out to train with Manchester United for a week in October 2009 to receive specialist coaching.

During his time at Peterborough United he gained back to back promotions in the 2007–08 and 2008–09 seasons with the posh although McKeown was to make just four appearances in the Championship. His last appearance for the Posh was in the final game of the season though despite a 0–1 defeat against Blackpool he was named man of the match, during the game his best save was leaping spectacularly to keep out DJ Campbell's sharp overhead kick at close range though he saw the same player spring from the ground to head in the rebound.

Loan to Boston United

Mckeown joined Boston United in August 2010 on loan until January 2011. He played a key role in Boston's excellent start to the season with 10 successive league clean sheets and had a total of 14 clean sheets in 18 games. On New Year's Day he played his last game and received a fantastic reception and farewell from the Boston United supporters. However, despite his remarkable record of clean sheets and fantastic form whilst on loan at Boston Peterborough United came to an agreement with James that he should seek pastures new. McKeown spent a week at Lincoln City on trial and a one-off appearance for Boston United in the FA Trophy due to their keeper Dan Haystead being cup tied, he then signed for Dutch Rotterdam based semi-professional side RKSV Leonidas in the Hoofdklasse league.

On Friday 23 June 2011 Grimsby Town announced they were in discussions to sign McKeown, following the club's announcement to bring in a second choice keeper to challenge number one Kenny Arthur after Town had heavily relied upon Goalkeeping Coach Steve Croudson in the previous season. On 2 July 2011 he signed a one-year contract with Town. McKeown played in the final of the Lincolnshire Senior Cup on 3 August 2011, beating Lincoln City 4–3 to win the cup at Sincil Bank.

McKeown was initially brought to the club as a back up keeper to challenge Kenny Arthur, but following an impressive pre-season he became the club's first choice keeper. He made his league debut for Grimsby Town on 13 August 2011 in the 0–2 defeat against Fleetwood. A week later he saved what became a crucial penalty against Newport taken by Craig McAllister to earn his side a 0–0 draw. During the 2011–12 campaign McKeown picked up 3 yellow cards, each for time wasting. McKeown was also ever-present during the 2011–12 season helping Grimsby Town produce 18 clean sheets in 55 games. On 24 April 2012 McKeown picked up four awards for Player of the Year at the club's annual presentation. On 30 April 2012 McKeown agreed to a new two-year contract with the club.

McKeown played in the final of the Lincolnshire Senior Cup on 31 July 2012, after the game finishing 1–1 at full-time, McKeown saved a penalty inturn beating Lincoln City in a penalty shoot-out to win the cup at Sincil Bank for a second consecutive year.

McKeown retained the Supporters Player of the Season award when he scooped the prize again once more for his part during the 2013–14 season. A host of clubs were believed to be chasing his signature, however on 16 May 2014, McKeown agreed a new two-year contract with the club.

On 16 August 2014, McKeown saved a crucial last-minute penalty, the game finishing 1–1, preventing Dover winning the game. He played in all the league games of the 2014–15 season as Grimsby came 3rd in the Conference, and secured a play-off spot. He also played in the 2015 Conference Premier play-off Final against Bristol Rovers at Wembley on 17 May 2015; following a 1–1 draw after extra time, Grimsby lost 5–3 in a penalty shoot-out.

McKeown picked up the Reusch Goalkeeper of the Year 2014–15 award on 20 May 2015, at The Non-League Paper's National Game Awards in association with The NLFA, for keeping 23 clean sheets himself.

As training was in full swing for the 2015–16 season, McKeown was admitted to hospital on 18 July 2015 and diagnosed as suffering with viral meningitis. Four days later, he finished his treatment and was released from hospital. McKeown was able to return to light training by 24 July 2016. Having already secured a play-off spot in the last home game against Chester, McKeown missed only the last game of the 2015–16 season as Paul Hurst's "Mariners" came 4th in the National League. McKeown played in Grimsby's 3–1 victory over Forest Green Rovers in the 2016 National League play-off Final at Wembley, seeing Grimsby promoted to League Two after a six-year absence from the Football League.

His efforts over the season earned him a place in the 2015–16 National League team of the year, alongside the league's outstanding players. McKeown signed a new two-year contract, that will keep him at the club until the summer of 2018.

McKeown made his League Two debut with the club on 6 August 2016 in the opening game of the 2016–17 season in Grimsby's 2–0 home victory against Morecambe. After losing the number 1 spot to Manchester United loanee Dean Henderson on 28 January 2017 McKeown confirmed he had handed in his transfer request.

McKeown made numerous saves in the final game of the 2016–17 season at home to League Two leaders Plymouth Argyle, which finished 1–1 and prevented them from becoming champions; the performance lead to McKeown being named in the English Football League Team of the Week for the month of May 2017.

On 26 December 2017, McKeown suffered an injury in the 33rd minute of the 1–1 stalemate against Mansfield Town and was replaced by Ben Killip. Scans revealed a ruptured groin and he would be missing for between six and eight weeks.

Richard Brodie (footballer)

Richard Jon Brodie (born 8 July 1987) is an English semi-professional footballer who plays as a striker for club Skelmersdale United. He has played in the Football League for Morecambe.

Brodie started his career with Whickham and, after being their top scorer in the 2005–06 season, moved to Newcastle Benfield in 2006. He signed for York City in January 2007 and finished 2006–07 with one goal and played in the Conference National play-off semi-final. He started 2007–08 with only three goals in 2007, but finished the season with 14 goals. Early in 2008–09, Brodie was loaned to Barrow and scored four goals during a one-month period. He finished the season as York's top scorer with 19 goals and played in their 2009 FA Trophy Final defeat at Wembley Stadium. The 2009–10 season saw Brodie play in York's defeat in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium and again finish as top scorer, this time with 34 goals. He joined Crawley Town in August 2010 for an undisclosed fee, and with them he won the Conference Premier title in 2010–11.

He joined Fleetwood Town on a season-long loan for 2011–12, winning a second Conference Premier title in as many seasons. Brodie had loan spells with Morecambe and Grimsby Town over 2012–13, and after being released by Crawley joined Gateshead. He was loaned out to Hereford United and Southport, joining the latter permanently in 2014. Having been Southport's top scorer with 14 goals in 2014–15, Brodie joined Aldershot Town but finished 2015–16 with Stockport County. He returned to York in 2016, but was released the following year after a loan spell with Macclesfield Town. This was followed by short spells with Boston United and Southport. He earned two caps for the England national C team from 2008 to 2009.

Brodie was born in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear and grew up in the town as a Sunderland supporter. He attended Whickham School and played football for the Gateshead district team as a teenager. He later played youth football with Whickham Fellside Juniors from the age of 10 to 16, Redheugh Boys Club, scoring six goals in a 14–2 victory over Consett Badgers in March 2004, and the Durham County under-18 team, featuring in the FA County Youth Cup in November. Brodie started his senior career in 2004 after making substitute appearances for Whickham in the semi-professional Northern League Division Two before playing for them permanently aged 17. He scored a hat-trick for Whickham in a 5–3 victory over Marske United in November 2005. He scored 21 league goals in 35 appearances for Whickham and was their top scorer in the 2005–06 season.

Brodie moved to Northern League Division One club Newcastle Benfield in the summer of 2006 and became a popular player at the club. This move came after impressing Benfield manager Paul Baker in a match between the teams, in which Brodie impressed with his physicality. While playing semi-professionally, Brodie took a part-time apprenticeship in joinery and later worked as a full-time joiner. He scored the first goal for Benfield in a friendly against Newcastle United in September, which finished as a 4–3 defeat. Brodie scored the second goal in a 2–0 victory over Cammell Laird with a direct free kick from 25 yards. He helped Benfield to victory in an FA Vase tie against Castle Vale in December by scoring their second goal in a 2–0 victory, which set up a fifth-round tie against Truro City. He was taken on trial by Premier League team Bolton Wanderers and he played for them in a juniors tournament in France, which ended unsuccessfully after he was played out of position at centre back. He scored three goals in 11 league appearances for Benfield.

After impressing against Conference National club York City in a FA Cup fourth qualifying round tie, Brodie trialled with the club and played in their reserve team, whilst also being allowed to play for Benfield in the FA Vase. He signed for York on transfer deadline day, 31 January 2007, on a contract until the end of 2006–07 for a nominal fee. He scored two minutes into his York debut with the third goal in a 4–0 victory away to Altrincham on 10 February 2007, having entered the match as a 64th-minute substitute. He was sent off during a North Riding Cup match for York's reserves against Scarborough in February 2007, but a suspension did not come into place until 14 days later, meaning he was able to play league-leaders Dagenham & Redbridge. York ranked fourth in the Conference National and Brodie played in both legs of the play-off semi-final defeat to Morecambe, losing 2–1 on aggregate, and finished the season with 14 appearances and one goal. In May 2007, York exercised their option to extend his contract for 2007–08.

Brodie made his first appearance of 2007–08 after being introduced as a 61st-minute substitute at home to Cambridge United on 11 August 2007, but was unable to help the team as they lost 2–1. His first goal of the season came with the opener in a 3–2 home defeat to Rushden & Diamonds on 30 August 2007, and this was followed up with a goal in the following match, a 2–2 home draw with Altrincham. Having not scored since, he received abuse from some sections of the York support during the 6–0 home victory over Rushall Olympic in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round on 27 October 2007. Following this, manager Billy McEwan said "I was disappointed to hear the young players like Richard Brodie getting stick. How can we develop young players if we don't support them?" Brodie and Onome Sodje scored in extra time to give York victory in the Conference League Cup fourth round match away to Stafford Rangers on 22 December 2007, which set a new club record of six successive away victories. Brodie went on to score two goals in stoppage time to give York a 4–3 away win over Droylsden, which drew praise from manager Colin Walker.

He suffered an ankle injury in a reserve match against Darlington on 8 January 2008, and returned to the team for a 2–2 draw away to Altrincham 11 days later. He was dropped from the team against Halifax Town in favour of loanee Leo Fortune-West, and even though manager Walker assured Brodie that he was in the club's long-term plans, Brodie reacted angrily to being substituted for Fortune-West at home to Ebbsfleet United on 29 March 2008. He finished his first full season at York with 14 goals in 48 appearances, as they finished 14th in the Conference Premier. In April 2008, the club took up its option of extending his contract until the end of 2008–09. Newly promoted Conference North club Gateshead made an inquiry for Brodie in June 2008, which was rejected by York. Gateshead later had a four-figure bid rejected, which would have been doubled if they would have won promotion into the Conference Premier the following season.

Following Martyn Woolford's departure from York, Brodie played on the left wing in the 1–0 away victory over Crawley Town on the opening day of the season. His first goal of the season came after being assisted by Simon Rusk in a 2–2 away draw with Northwich Victoria. After coming on as a substitute in the 68th minute, he was sent off in the 76th minute of a 3–1 away defeat against Wrexham on 7 October 2008, after initially being shown a yellow card for kicking the ball away and then receiving a second card for a tackle on Carl Tremarco, which resulted in him being suspended for York's match against Woking.

He joined York's Conference Premier rivals Barrow on a one-month loan on 23 October 2008, having made 15 appearances and scored three goals for York up to that point in 2008–09. After Brodie scored two goals on his debut for Barrow in a 4–0 away victory Tamworth in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round, Barrow's joint-manager Darren Sheridan said "He did well and he gives us more options for the team. It was a great debut from him and we know there is still more to come in the next few games". This performance led to him being nominated as Player of the Round for the fourth qualifying round, which was eventually awarded to Sam Hatton of AFC Wimbledon. Barrow revealed that they were hoping to sign him permanently in January 2009 if his loan spell at the club proved successful. He made his league debut for Barrow in a 3–1 home victory over Forest Green Rovers and he scored against Gateshead in the Conference League Cup third round for Barrow, the match finishing 3–1 after extra time. It was agreed for Brodie's loan at the club to be extended following the match, but York overturned this decision a day later. He made his final appearance for Barrow in a 1–0 home defeat to Weymouth on 22 November 2008, finishing the spell with seven appearances and four goals. He later ruled out the possibility of rejoining Barrow in January 2009, saying he was committed to York.

He made his first appearance for York following his return a day after making his final appearance for Barrow, coming on as a 61st-minute substitute for Liam Shepherd in a 2–2 draw at home to Crawley on 23 November 2008. Brodie scored York's equaliser in the following match away to Salisbury City on 29 November 2008 with a goal in the 83rd minute, which finished as a 1–1 draw in Martin Foyle's first match as manager. After picking up a yellow card against Salisbury, his fifth of the season for York, he was handed a one-match suspension which saw him miss the match against Grays Athletic. He scored with a 25-yard shot on his return away to Histon on 9 December 2008, which finished as a 1–1 draw. He scored twice against Northwich in the FA Trophy first round as York progressed with a 2–0 away victory, Foyle rating Brodie's first as the "goal of the season". Foyle also stated his desire for Brodie to stay at York, after continued reports of interest from Barrow. Barrow joint-manager David Bayliss said he was unlikely to table a bid for Brodie in January 2009, claiming "If we had a hell of a lot of money we could maybe get him away but we haven't". Foyle responded by saying he had no intention of selling Brodie.

Brodie scored the winning goal for York in a 2–1 away victory over Oxford United in the FA Trophy second round, ensuring their progression to the third round. He scored York's first goal in a 2–1 home win over A.F.C. Telford United in the FA Trophy semi-final second leg, with the tie being won 4–1 on aggregate, which saw the team reach the final at Wembley Stadium. A yellow card picked up against Kidderminster Harriers on 28 March 2009 resulted in Brodie receiving a two-match suspension, meaning he would miss matches against Grays and Oxford, after being booked on 10 occasions during the season. He returned to the team for a 2–1 home defeat to Northwich on 11 April 2009, and during this match he was fouled in the penalty area, with the penalty kick being scored by Mark Robinson. Brodie scored against Weymouth in a 2–1 away victory on 24 April 2009, which ensured York's survival in the Conference Premier. They finished the season 17th in the table. Brodie started in the 2009 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium on 9 May 2009, which York lost 2–0 to Stevenage Borough. He finished the season as York's top scorer with 19 goals in 46 appearances, and in May 2009 the club exercised its option to extend his contract for 2009–10.

Gateshead made an undisclosed five-figure bid for Brodie in May 2009, which was rejected by York. He signed a new two-year contract with York in June 2009. He scored York's goal on the opening day of 2009–10 in a match away to Oxford, which finished as a 2–1 defeat. After a run of entering three matches as a substitute, he started against Gateshead away and scored York's first goal with a 12-yard shot in a 2–1 victory. Brodie won a penalty against Crawley after being fouled by Dominic Collins, which he scored six minutes into the match, before passing the ball to Michael Gash, who scored the second goal in a 2–0 victory. Following the match, Foyle commented on their partnership, saying "They are doing well together because Michael leads the line very well and Richard looks to hit the flanks." After receiving a yellow card in a home match with Oxford on 17 October 2009 for kicking the ball away, which was his fifth booking of the season, he was handed a one-match suspension for York's match against Luton Town. York claimed the booking was the result of mistaken identity, as Adam Smith was the player who committed the offence, and an appeal with The Football Association was lodged. The ban was overturned and he played for York in a 1–1 draw on 20 October 2009, assisting Neil Barrett's goal for York with a pass.

He scored twice for York in a 3–2 home victory over League Two team Crewe Alexandra in the FA Cup first round on 7 November 2009, which included the first and final goals. Following this, he was voted Player of the Round for the FA Cup first round. In the following match, he scored his first hat-trick for York, with three goals in a 3–2 home win over Chester City on 10 November 2009. After picking up a yellow card against AFC Wimbledon on 21 November 2009, Brodie was handed a one-match suspension, which resulted in him missing a match against Gateshead. He was named the Conference Premier Player of the Month for November 2009, during which he scored six goals in five appearances. Brodie scored his 20th goal of the season in a 2–1 home victory over Wrexham, a result that equalled the club record for successive victories in all competitions with eight. This goal broke the club record for reaching 20 goals in a season in the quickest time, beating Arthur Bottom's record by six days. Brodie played for York in the FA Cup third round against Premier League team Stoke City, in which they were beaten 3–1 away. He scored two goals and provided an assist in a 4–1 home win over Hayes & Yeading United, which broke the club record for consecutive league victories with eight. League Two team Grimsby Town made an offer for Brodie in January 2010, with chairman John Fenty's offer being rejected as it did not meet York's valuation.

He was handed a two-match suspension after receiving his 10th yellow card of the season during a 1–0 home victory over Newport County in an FA Trophy second round replay on 26 January 2010. He returned in a 1–0 away win over Kettering on 6 February 2010, before being handed a three-match suspension as a result of being sent off during a 1–0 away defeat to Ebbsfleet a week later after his elbow caught Dean Pooley. This resulted in a head wound that required three stitches for Pooley, and York's directors and manager apologised to Ebbsfleet manager Liam Daish for the tackle. Following Chester's expulsion from the Football Conference in March 2010, the three goals Brodie scored against them were discounted as their results were expunged. He scored for the first time in 12 matches with two goals in a 4–0 victory away to Grays on 30 March 2010. He scored two goals against Barrow on 13 April 2010 in a 3–0 home victory, a result that confirmed York's place in the play-offs.

Brodie was named as York's Players' Player of the Year for the season, as well as being awarded the Keith Walwyn Golden Boot, having scored 32 goals at that point. York finished fifth in the Conference Premier, and Brodie was the division's joint top scorer alongside Matt Tubbs with 26 goals. He scored the winning goal on 89 minutes to give York a 1–0 home victory against Luton in the play-off semi-final first leg. He played in the 1–0 away victory in the second leg, meaning York won the tie 2–0 on aggregate. After the match, Brodie was hit by a coin, with the squad being forced into the back of a stand after missiles were thrown at them by a section of Luton fans. He started in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 16 May 2010, in which York lost 3–1 to Oxford. He finished 2009–10 with 51 appearances and 34 goals, making him York's highest goalscorer in a season since Bottom scored 39 in 1954–55. York entered negotiations over a new contract with Brodie after the end of the season. At the Football Conference's Annual Presentation Dinner, he was named the Conference Premier Player of the Year and a member of the Team of the Year.

York's Conference Premier rivals Crawley had a £125,000 bid for Brodie rejected during the summer of 2010, and he scored his first goal of 2010–11 with a penalty in a 3–0 home win over Altrincham on 28 August. However, Brodie's form for York early in the season had been unsettled by Crawley's interest in signing him, which he claimed to have been aware of for "about a month to six weeks" after Crawley manager Steve Evans made an inquiry about him in July 2010.

He signed for Crawley for an undisclosed fee on 31 August 2010, the transfer being completed three minutes before the transfer deadline. The fee was reported by "The Press" to be around £300,000, although Crawley co-owner Bruce Winfield dismissed this figure, saying "it was nowhere near that". "The Non-League Paper" reported the fee to be £275,500; if true, this meant a new record had been set for the highest transfer fee between two non-League clubs. After signing, Brodie said "What they're trying to plan here and the aims this club have got is to be a Football League club. They've got as good a chance as anybody." He made his debut as a 55th-minute substitute in a 1–1 home draw with Fleetwood Town on 4 September 2010. On his first start, Brodie scored his first goal for Crawley with the second goal in a 2–0 victory away to Histon on 11 September 2010. Crawley rejected an offer for him from an unnamed League Two club in January 2011. Brodie struggled to force his way into the Crawley starting line-up on a regular basis, and finished the season with 13 goals in 45 appearances for Crawley as the club won the Conference Premier title and therefore promotion into League Two.

On 16 May 2011, Brodie signed for Conference Premier club Fleetwood Town on loan for 2011–12 for a five-figure loan fee. Homesickness was cited as the reason for the transfer, with manager Evans saying "Richard is a very talented lad but it is no secret he has failed to settle away from his family home". Brodie debuted as a 54th-minute substitute for Magno Vieira in Fleetwood's 2–0 away win over Grimsby on 13 August 2011. His first goal for Fleetwood was the team's fifth goal in a 5–2 home victory over Kidderminster on 20 September 2011. Brodie's sixth goal for Fleetwood came on 26 December 2011 against Southport, when he scored a late equaliser in the 88th minute to make the score 2–2 in front of 3,029 supporters, a record home league attendance for Fleetwood. He scored twice during the away league match against the same club on 1 January 2012, the first coming after just four minutes and the second coming in the 29th minute, which made the score 3–0 to Fleetwood. Two minutes after scoring his second goal Brodie was sent off after receiving a second yellow card, although his team went on to win the match 6–0. He made 39 appearances and scored 10 goals in 2011–12 and won his second Conference Premier winner's medal in as many seasons, as Fleetwood won the title and therefore promotion into League Two.

Brodie joined League Two club Morecambe on 19 July 2012 on a six-month loan. He made his debut in Morecambe's 2012–13 opener as a 54th-minute substitute for Jordan Burrow in their 2–1 away victory over Championship team Blackpool on 12 August 2012 in the League Cup first round. His first start came on 18 August 2012 in Morecambe's 3–0 win away to Exeter City on 18 August 2012. Having scored six goals in 27 appearances, he returned to Crawley on 2 January 2013 as Morecambe were not in a financial position to extend his loan. On 4 January 2013, Brodie joined Conference Premier team Grimsby Town on loan until the end of 2012–13. He made his debut the following day, starting Grimsby's 1–1 home draw with Hereford United, before scoring his first goal in a 4–2 win at home to Alfreton Town on 2 February 2013. Brodie was released from his loan spell on 25 March 2013, the day after he missed a penalty in the 4–1 penalty shoot-out defeat against Wrexham in the 2013 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium. He had scored two goals in 15 appearances for Grimsby.

Brodie was released by Crawley at the end of the season and went on trial with Hartlepool United, who were newly relegated into League Two. He instead signed for Conference Premier club Gateshead on 15 May 2013 on a one-year contract. He scored on his debut away to Kidderminster on 10 August 2013, although Gateshead went on to lose 3–1. After scoring twice in his first seven appearances for Gateshead, Brodie signed for their Conference Premier rivals Hereford United on a one-month loan on 13 September 2013, being reunited with former York manager Foyle. He made his debut later that day in Hereford's 2–0 home defeat to Aldershot Town, and scored his only goal for the club in a 1–1 draw away to F.C. Halifax Town on 21 September 2013. He returned to Gateshead after the loan expired, having made eight appearances and scored one goal for Hereford.

Brodie was loaned out again on 21 November 2013, joining fellow Conference Premier club Southport until January 2014. He made his Southport debut two days later in a 5–1 defeat away to Aldershot and scored his first goal on 28 December 2013 in a 2–1 away loss against Alfreton. On 3 January 2014, Brodie's loan at Southport was extended until the end of the season. He completed the loan spell with one goal from 18 appearances as Southport finished 18th in the Conference Premier. At the end of the season, Brodie was released by Gateshead in May 2014.

Brodie joined Southport permanently on 18 June 2014, being signed by his former York and Hereford manager Foyle. His first appearance after signing permanently came as a 62nd-minute substitute for Scott Kay in a 0–0 away draw with Torquay United on 16 August 2014, before starting the following match, a 2–1 home win over Altrincham a week later, scoring Southport's first goal after reacting first to a John Marsden header that had hit the post. Brodie was Southport's top scorer in 2014–15 with 14 goals from 41 appearances as Southport finished 19th in the Conference Premier. He signed a new contract with the club in May 2015.

Although he signed a new contract with Southport, Brodie signed for their National League rivals Aldershot Town on 14 August 2015 on a one-year contract. He debuted the following day as a 58th-minute substitute in a 3–0 away defeat to Wrexham, but started the following match, a 1–1 home draw with Dover Athletic, in which he scored Aldershot's equalising goal on 36 minutes from a Jim Stevenson pass. Having scored five goals from 26 appearances, Brodie left Aldershot by mutual consent on 29 January 2016, so he could move closer to home for family reasons. A day later, he joined National League North club Stockport County and played for them on a part-time basis. Brodie scored on his debut with a close-range header in Stockport's 2–1 away defeat to Harrogate Town on 2 February 2016. He scored four goals from 13 appearances as Stockport ranked ninth in the National League North. He was released by the club in May 2016.

Brodie re-signed for York City, who were newly relegated into the National League, on 17 May 2016 on a one-year contract. He made his second debut for York as an 84th-minute substitute in a 1–1 away draw with Maidstone United. Having struggled to come to terms with the physical requirements of returning to professional football, Brodie was told by manager Jackie McNamara that he would not start home matches until improving his fitness levels. Brodie scored his first goal of 2016–17 with a penalty in first-half stoppage time away against Gateshead on 16 August 2016, with York losing 6–1. This marked the start of a run of five goals from five matches, with McNamara praising his ability to score different types of goals, having scored with a header, a penalty, a left-footed volley and two right-footed shots in this run. Despite being York's top scorer with seven goals, new manager Gary Mills suggested in November 2016 that Brodie was not fit enough to play under him.

On 17 November 2016, he joined York's National League rivals Macclesfield Town on loan until 1 January 2017, with Mills unimpressed with his fitness levels and disciplinary record. Mills implied that Brodie would only be considered for selection on his return if he were to reach full fitness. Brodie made his debut two days later as an 88th-minute substitute in Macclesfield's 2–1 away win over Aldershot. He only made the starting line-up once for Macclesfield, with three of his four appearances for the club coming as a substitute. Upon his return to York, Brodie was given permission by Mills to leave, as he wanted to find a club where he would play more regularly. He left York by mutual consent on 11 January 2017.

On 12 January 2017, Brodie signed for National League North club Boston United on a contract until the end of 2016–17, with the option of a further year. He debuted on 21 January 2017 when starting Boston's 2–0 away win over Bradford Park Avenue, in which he was substituted in the 75th minute. Having made only three appearances, Brodie's contract with Boston was terminated on 15 February 2017, because of what manager Adam Murray described as an "internal matter". Brodie re-signed for National League club Southport on 18 March 2017, joining in time to be an unused substitute in their 2–0 away defeat to Braintree Town. He made his debut a week later, starting in Southport's 1–0 home win over Boreham Wood, in which he was substituted for Andrai Jones on 61 minutes. Brodie made seven appearances as Southport were relegated to the National League North after finishing in 23rd place in 2016–17. In July 2017, he had an unsuccessful trial with National League North club Darlington.

Brodie signed for Northern Premier League Division One North club Skelmersdale United on 4 August 2017. He made his debut on 12 August 2017, starting Skelmersdale's 1–0 away defeat to Brighouse Town on the opening day of 2017–18. After scoring three goals from 10 appearances for Skelmersdale, Brodie signed for National League club Solihull Moors on 22 September 2017. He made his debut the following day, starting in their 2–2 home draw with Dagenham & Redbridge, with manager Liam McDonald praising Brodie's partnership with Oladapo Afolayan. Brodie was released by Solihull on 26 October 2017, having failed to score in five appearances for the club.

He signed for Northern Premier League Premier Division club Rushall Olympic on 28 October 2017, scoring on his debut the same day with a 75th-minute penalty in a 2–0 home win over Nantwich Town in the FA Trophy second qualifying round. He scored the opening goal in the Walsall Senior Cup final on 17 May 2018, which Rushall won 4–3 in a penalty shoot-out after a 2–2 extra-time draw. Brodie signed for Rushall's Northern Premier League Premier Division rivals Warrington Town on 20 June 2018. He left the club on 9 September 2018, having scored twice, after Brodie told manager Paul Carden that he wanted to play more regularly. He returned to Rushall Olympic the same month before signing for Northern Premier League Division One West club Ramsbottom United on 23 December.

Brodie signed for Midland League Premier Division club Ilkeston Town on 20 February 2019 to provide competition for striker Alex Marshall. He moved back to Skelmersdale United later that year.

Brodie was named in the England national C team, who represent England at non-League level, for a friendly away to Bosnia and Herzegovina on 16 September 2008. He started the match, but was substituted after 60 minutes, the match finishing a 6–2 defeat. He was named on standby for the 2007–09 International Challenge Trophy match against the Belgium under-21 team on 19 May 2009. He was given a second call-up for the match away to Poland under-23 team on 17 November 2009. Brodie started the match and had a goal disallowed, before being substituted on 65 minutes after picking up a foot injury. This was the final of two caps earned for England C.

Brodie plays as a striker and was described by the "Times & Star" as a "prolific" goalscorer. After making his debut for York in February 2007, Dave Flett of "The Press" said Brodie "looks a potent package of pace and power with a competitive streak that should strike fear into countless Conference defenders". Foyle's guidance while manager at York was credited as benefiting Brodie. He stated "I've worked hard trying to improve my game and I'm starting to score different types of goals" in December 2009. He was described by the "Huddersfield Daily Examiner" as "one of non-league football's hottest properties" in January 2010. After signing for Crawley in August 2010, manager Evans said "The lad is a terrific player, he works very hard for the team and gets a goal".

Brodie coached and mentored the Southport College team in 2014–15, and organised a charity match between them and the Redheugh Boys Club in May 2015 to raise money for Diabetes UK. His partner gave birth to their first child, Charlie, in August 2016.

Ray Goddard

Raymond Goddard (13 February 1949 − 11 December 2007) was an English football goalkeeper, who played for three London clubs between 1967 and 1981.

Goddard began his career as a member of Fulham's youth team, but was released without being offered a professional contract. He subsequently joined Orient, where he spent eight seasons. In 1967 the entire Orient squad was transfer-listed to ease the financial plight of the club, with the exception of Goddard. He was a member of the Orient side that won the Third Division title in 1969-70, and narrowly missed out on promotion to the top flight in 1974. In total, he played 278 league games for the O's. Having kept young reserve keeper Steve Bowtell out of the first team for several seasons, Goddard unluckily lost his place to the newly signed John Jackson in October 1973. However, he returned to the first team after an injured Jackson was dropped in the O's failed promotion campaign of '73-'74. He suffered a strained relationship with manager George Petchey after first learning of Jackson's promotion, and his own demotion, on the team bus. Before leaving the O's he even joined Greenock Morton in Scotland for a month before finally deciding to leave Orient.

In November 1974, Goddard joined Millwall, but Petchey became the Lions' boss and after their history, Goddard's days were obviously numbered. In February 1978 he joined Wimbledon who had only recently been elected to the league. He spent four seasons at Wimbledon and was part of the team that won promotion to the Third Division in 1979, relegated back to the Fourth Division the following year, and then promoted back again in 1981. In his final match for the Dons, Goddard scored from the penalty spot in a 4–2 defeat against Bury.

After leaving Wimbledon, Goddard finished his career at non-league Wealdstone. After his retirement from football, Goddard moved to Spain where he ran a bar. He died from a stroke in December 2007, aged 58.

Max Thompson (footballer)

Maxwell Stuart Thompson (born 31 December 1956) is an English former footballer. A defender, he scored eight goals in 137 league games in a ten-year career in the Football League. At age 17 years and 128 days, he became Liverpool's youngest ever player (his record has since been broken) when he made his debut in May 1974. He joined Blackpool three years later, and went on to play 99 league games for the club in a four-year spell, and was also loaned out to Dallas Tornado and Seattle Sounders. He then spent the 1980s with various clubs across the world: Bournemouth, Port Vale, Baltimore Blast (USA), Académica de Coimbra (Portugal), Northwich Victoria, Caernarfon Town, Fleetwood, Newport County, Kramfors (Sweden), and Southport. He later worked at Anfield as a physiotherapist.

Thompson started his career with Liverpool and broke the club record for being the youngest player to appear for Liverpool, when Bill Shankly handed him his First Division debut at the end of the 1973–74 season against Tottenham Hotspur on 8 May 1974, at the age of 17 years and 128 days. His record was broken by Jack Robinson, who made his debut for Liverpool at the age of 16. Thompson was on the substitutes bench at Wembley in the 1974 FA Charity Shield victory over Leeds United.

Hugh Morris (1872 – 20 September 1897) was a Welsh footballer who played as a forward for Manchester City, Sheffield United and Grimsby Town in the 19th century. Born in Chirk, Wales, he gained three caps for the Welsh national team.

Morris was first spotted by Ardwick when playing for Chirk in the Welsh cup and the Manchester side duly signed him in 1891. Morris was the leading goalscorer for the club in the 1891–92 Football Alliance season, scoring 10 goals in 22 appearances, including a hat-trick against Walsall Town Swifts. The following season Ardwick were admitted to the newly formed Football League Second Division and Morris played in the club's first ever Football League fixture, scoring twice as Ardwick beat Bootle 7–0. Morris continued to play regularly for Ardwick before he was transferred to Sheffield United, then of the First Division in December 1893. He became a regular in United's first team for the following 18 months, having rejected an offer to play in the United States in 1894, and made 39 league appearances, scoring nine goals for the Yorkshire club. In September 1895 Morris was suspended for "lodging in a public house" (the club was run on strict Methodist lines at the time and this was against the terms of his contract), before being transferred back to Ardwick, now renamed Manchester City, in the following November along with Joe Davies and Bob Hill. Returning to Hyde Road, Morris made 20 appearances in his second spell at the Manchester club, before moving to Grimsby Town in May 1896 where he played for a further season.

Nigel Edwards (born 31 December 1950) is a Welsh former footballer who played as a full back. He made more than 400 Football League appearances for Chester City and Aldershot.

Born Wrexham, Edwards was signed by Chester as a youngster in September 1968 after being at Blackburn Rovers on amateur terms. After impressing in the reserve side, Edwards made his Football League debut on 23 April 1969 against Lincoln City, alongside fellow youngster Grenville Millington. The pair would go on to make more than 500 league appearances for the club between them.

By 1971–72, Edwards was first-choice right-back at Chester and the subject of constant transfer speculation, having been involved in a tour of New Zealand and the Far East with Wales the previous summer. Although he had a brief loan spell at Rotherham United in the first half of 1973–1974 while out of Chester's first team, Edwards returned to Chester without appearing for the Millers and soon regained his place in the side.

In 1974–1975, Edwards missed just four games as Chester were promoted from Division Four and reached the Football League Cup semi-finals. Despite playing at full back, Edwards scored seven times during the season. Two years later he helped Chester reach the fifth round of the FA Cup and win the spin-off Debenhams Cup competition at the end of the season. He remained with the club until he joined Aldershot in July 1978.

After four seasons with Aldershot, Edwards returned to Chester in June 1982 with funds raised by supporters through the Seals Player Appeal Fund. He marked his first league game back with the winning goal against Crewe Alexandra, but he made just seven more league appearances and moved on to Oswestry Town the following year.

<doc id="15841522" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15841522" title="Bob Benson">
Bob Benson

Robert William Benson (9 February 1883 – 19 February 1916) was an English professional footballer, who played as a full back. Born in Whitehaven, Cumbria he spent the majority of his professional career with Sheffield United but also had spells with Southampton and Woolwich Arsenal. He gained a solitary England cap in 1913 as well as representing The Football League and undertaking an FA tour of South Africa but died as a result of playing a football match in 1916.

Benson had worked as a coal-miner whilst playing for various local clubs in and around Whitehaven where he was born, including Swalwell, where he was spotted by Newcastle United and signed as a professional in December 1902. Competition for places restricted him to just a single appearance for the club, on 7 March 1903.

Soon after the start of the 1904–05 season, the Southampton directors were trying to recruit a right-back following the departure of Tom Robertson in the summer. Joe Hoare had been tried but was now past his prime, so the directors sent a club official to the north east to hunt for a player. The official's quest took him to Newcastle, where he interviewed Benson and, after agreeing a fee of £150 with the Magpies, the official returned ""triumphantly"" to the south coast with his ""catch"".

Benson made his Southampton debut on 1 October 1904, in a 1–1 draw at home to Brighton & Hove Albion. Benson's form was immediately impressive; described as ""big and bold"", he was a terror to opposition forwards, ""snuffing out their moves with his sense of anticipation"". Benson also developed an unorthodox method of taking penalties – by running the full length of the pitch from his full-back position before kicking the ball. However, this method of penalty-taking was not a success, never actually converting any of the penalties he took in his year with the "Saints".

During his one season at The Dell, Benson missed several long periods through injury, when he was replaced by the veteran Samuel Meston, and made 19 Southern League appearances, plus three in the FA Cup, before a summer 1905 transfer took him back to the Football League First Division for a fee of £150, when he joined Sheffield United.

Benson had arrived at Bramall Lane relatively cheaply, with Southampton mistakenly believing that Newcastle had retained his registration and thus were due an additional fee from the Blades. He spent eight seasons at Bramall Lane, cementing himself in the defence where he developed into a strong tackler and was commanding in the air. He became the team's regular penalty taker, perfecting a routine whereby he would jog slowly up from his normal defensive position before breaking into a run and shooting after a teammate had placed the ball on the spot – all but one of his 21 goals scored for United coming from the penalty spot.

Benson took over the captaincy from Bernard Wilkinson but soon relinquished it to Jack English when he lost his place in the first team through injury, following which he requested a transfer. During his time with Sheffield United, the club generally finished in mid-table, with their highest finish being fourth in 1906–07. He played 283 matches for Sheffield United in all competitions, scoring 21 goals, including 20 penalties.

In April 1913 Benson joined Woolwich Arsenal, soon after they had made their move to Highbury. He made his debut against Bristol City on 29 November 1913, and over two seasons he made 53 appearances for the Gunners, mostly at full-back although he was later moved to centre forward, and eventually scored seven goals for the club as they tried for promotion back into the First Division; Arsenal would eventually win re-election based on their position of fifth in 1914–15 after the end of World War I.

Due to the war, in 1915 first-class football was suspended. Benson quit the game to work at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, munitions factory. He kept in touch with his old club and on 19 February 1916 attended a London Combination match at Highbury against Reading. With his former teammate Joe Shaw unable to make the game, Benson volunteered to take his place, which ultimately had fatal consequences. Having not played a game for nearly a year, Benson was not match-fit. He collapsed on the pitch in the second half and had to be taken off; soon afterwards he died in the Highbury changing rooms, in the arms of team trainer George Hardy.

It was later determined he had died of a burst blood vessel, from a long-standing medical condition. Benson was buried wearing his Arsenal shirt. Three months later, Arsenal held a testimonial match in his honour, against a Rest of London XI, with the proceeds going to his widow; over 5,000 attended to pay their respects.

His form at Sheffield United brought him to the notice of the Football Association and in 1910 he was a member of the F.A. touring party to South Africa, as well as representing the Football League on one occasion. He received his solitary cap for England on 15 February 1913 when he played at left-back against Ireland, when England lost 2–1, with both Irish goals coming from Benson's Sheffield United teammate Billy Gillespie.

John James (footballer, born 1948)

John Brian James (born 24 October 1948) is an English former footballer who played as a striker. He played in the English Football League for Port Vale, Chester and Tranmere Rovers, making 381 appearances in the process, and also played in the North American Soccer League for the Chicago Sting. He won promotions out of the Fourth Division with Port Vale, Chester and Tranmere.

James began his career in his native Staffordshire with Port Vale, turning professional in April 1966. He became a first team regular from September 1967 and went on to make more than 200 league appearances for Vale, including 43 in the club's promotion season from Division Four in 1969–70. His goals were crucial to the club, top scorer in both 1969–70 and 1970–71 with 17 and 15 goals respectively. He missed much of the 1971–72 campaign due to a cartilage injury requiring two separate operations. After returning to the squad in February 1972 he was much less effective and lost his first team spot.

In February 1973, James moved to Chester for £5,000, playing his first game alongside fellow home debutant Reg Matthewson in a 5–0 win over Darlington, that saw James amongst the scorers. The following season saw James net 21 league goals, the highest tally by a Chester player since Gary Talbot in 1968–69, but his most memorable campaign would follow in 1974–75.

James struck 13 times as Chester won promotion from the Fourth Division, but he was to enjoy national fame thanks to his goalscoring exploits in the League Cup during the same season. After wins over Walsall, Blackpool and Preston North End, Chester were drawn at home to First Division champions Leeds United. On a momentous night, Chester recorded a shock 3–0 win, with James scoring twice. He followed it up by scoring the winning goal in the quarter-finals against another top-flight side, Newcastle United, to set up a semi–final tie with Aston Villa. James found the net in the second leg to level the aggregate score at 4–4, only for Brian Little to grab a late Villa winner and break Chester's hearts.

Despite his contribution to Chester's success, James played just two first–team games for Chester after promotion and joined neighbours Tranmere Rovers in part-exchange for Paul Crossley in September 1975. Once more promotion from the Fourth Division was enjoyed, with James netting 19 times in 38 league games. After a spell playing for Chicago Sting in the North American Soccer League, he returned to Prenton Park and remained at the club before joining non–league Stafford Rangers in 1978.

Speaking in 2016, a Port Vale supporter who remembered seeing James play compared him to a Duracell battery due to his high stamina levels.

James later moved to Torquay to run a newsagents.

Roache, born in Leytonstone and a product of Barnet's youth academy system, was given a professional contract in the summer of 2003. He spent time on loan at Berkhamsted Town, Bishop's Stortford and Windsor & Eton during the 2003–04 season, and still found time to make his Barnet debut, on 14 October in the Football League Trophy against Second Division club Brentford. He helped the club gain promotion from the Conference the following season, and made his debut in the Football League on 27 August 2005, as a late substitute in the 1–0 home defeat to Grimsby Town. In 2006, he went out on loan again, spending two months at Yeading, and was released at the end of the 2005–06 season.

Roache joined Conference South club Cambridge City, where he spent two-and-a-half years, including a spell on loan to Eastleigh, and scored 21 goals from 91 appearances in all competitions. He then joined Conference National side Histon in January 2009 for "a four-figure fee". He made his Histon debut as a substitute against Forest Green Rovers in February 2009, the first of twelve appearances from the bench without scoring, and was released before the 2009–10 season.

Reg Matthewson

Reg Matthewson (6 August 1939 – 29 August 2016) was an English professional footballer. He played as a defender in The Football League for three clubs, making 394 appearances in the process.

Matthewson began his professional career in his home city of Sheffield with Sheffield United, whom he signed a professional contract with in June 1958. He had to wait until 1961–62 for his league debut, with the Blades playing in the top-flight of English football at the time.

After six years in the Blades' first-team, Matthewson joined Fulham in February 1968 for £30,000, beginning a five-year spell at Craven Cottage that included one promotion and two relegations. In January 1973 Matthewson dropped into the Fourth Division when he joined Chester, initially on loan. He made his debut in a 1–1 away draw at Aldershot, with his home debut a fortnight later ending in a 5–0 win over Darlington. Matthewson quickly joined Chester permanently and became club captain when Bob Wallace moved to Aldershot.

The 1974–75 season was to be a final glory for Matthewson, as he skippered Chester to a first promotion from Football League Division Four and on an unlikely run to the Football League Cup semi-finals. Matthewson featured in all of Chester's eight games during the cup run and missed just two league games, but he was to rarely play after promotion. His final game for Chester was a 3–1 derby defeat to Wrexham in April 1976.

Matthewson had a spell on the Chester coaching staff and then joined Bangor City as player-coach, working under his former Chester teammate Stuart Mason. He later had a spell assisting Graham Turner at Shrewsbury Town and away from football worked for a chemical fertiliser company in Ellesmere Port. His nephew Trevor Matthewson played professionally. In his retirement, Matthewson lived in Tarvin.

He turned professional in June 1988 and went on to make more than 100 Football League appearances for the club, during a period that saw Rovers climb from the fourth to the second tier of English professional football, with Garnett making three appearances at Wembley Stadium for Rovers between May 1990 and May 1991.

Garnett spent most of the 1992–93 season out on loan, completely an unwanted hat-trick of being involved in three relegations from the same division during the same season, at Football League Second Division sides Chester City (where he was the final debutant in Harry McNally's seven-year spell in charge), Preston North End and Wigan Athletic. He remained at Tranmere until March 1996, when he joined Swansea City for £200,000 but six months later he returned to north-west England with Oldham Athletic for £150,000.

Garnett spent six years in the Oldham first-team before joining Nationwide Conference side Halifax Town for 2002–03, in a loan move that became permanent. The following season he moved to Morecambe, in another loan deal that was made permanent. He was released at the end of the 2003–04 season and joined Harrogate Town as player-coach.

Bobby Bauld

Robert Bauld (14 March 1902 – 19 October 1980) was a Scottish professional footballer who played as a left half and inside forward. He played in the Scottish Football League for Raith Rovers and Dundee United, and in the English Football League for Bradford City and Chesterfield.

Born in Cowdenbeath, Bauld was the son of the colliery under-manager at nearby Glencraig. He played junior football for Glencraig Celtic and began to attract the attention of a number of senior clubs. In October 1920 he appeared as a trialist for St Bernard's in a Central League match against Dundee Hibernian and was reported to have "played well" at right back. Later that month, Bauld was also due to play as a trialist for Cowdenbeath in the Central League, but missed the chance due to suspension after he was sent off playing for Glencraig.

On 4 December 1920, Bauld "gave a satisfactory display" turning out for a Scottish Select in a junior international trial match against Dumbartonshire at Clydeholm, Clydebank. He was then selected to appear in a further trial match, for the Rest of Scotland against Glasgow at Firhill Park, Glasgow on 4 January 1921. His performance at Clydebank also led to further interest from senior clubs, with approaches from Raith Rovers and Celtic before Bauld agreed to appear for Rangers "A" in a Scottish Alliance fixture against Ayr United "A". He also had a trial with Tottenham Hotspur before signing for Raith Rovers in January 1921. Bauld made his Scottish League debut for Raith in a 1–0 victory over Aberdeen at Stark's Park on 8 January 1921, when he "gave a sterling exhibition in his first senior game".

Bauld moved from Raith to Dundee United on 31 October 1923 for a fee of £100. He scored 30 goals in 143 games across all competitions for them. He moved to Bradford City in July 1927, for a transfer fee of £350. He scored 34 goals in 217 appearances for them in the Football League, as well as scoring 1 goal in 10 FA Cup appearances. He moved to Chesterfield in May 1935, making a further 2 league appearances before retiring.

Jock Ewart

John Ewart (14 February 1891 – 22 June 1943) was a Scottish football goalkeeper who made over 280 appearances in the Football League for Bradford City. He also played in the Scottish League for Airdrieonians in two spells and won one cap for Scotland at international level. The SFA describes him as "a goalkeeper who helped to perpetuate the myth of eccentricity required for the position".

A goalkeeper, Ewart began his career with a number of junior clubs in Scotland, before joining Scottish League First Division club Airdrieonians in March 1909. He moved to England to join First Division club Bradford City in May 1912 for £1,200, a then-record fee for a goalkeeper. Either side of the First World War, Ewart made 302 appearances for the club, before returning Airdrieonians for a £300 fee in July 1923. In May 1927, Ewart returned to Bradford City, newly-relegated to the Third Division North, for a second spell, but lasted one season before seeing out his career with Second Division club Preston North End and retiring in 1931. Shortly after his retirement, Ewart was suspended from football sine die by the FA for an alleged match fixing incident.

Ewart made two appearances for the Scottish League XI when in his first spell at Airdrie. When at Bradford he won a single full cap for Scotland in a 3–0 win over England in the 1921 British Home Championship.

After retiring from football, Ewart returned to the game as a trainer.

Ewart spoke French and German and was a skilled flute, piccolo and violin player. He served as a private in the First World War, firstly in the West Yorkshire Regiment and latterly in the Training Reserve. Ewart was a publican later in life.

Jefferson Montero

Jefferson Antonio Montero Vite (; born 1 September 1989) is an Ecuadorian professional footballer who plays as a winger for English club Birmingham City, on loan from Swansea City, and for the Ecuador national team.

Born in Babahoyo, Los Ríos Province, Montero started playing professionally with Emelec, but first impressed whilst at Independiente José Teran in the Ecuadorian Serie B.

Shortly after arriving he was loaned to Mexican club Dorados de Sinaloa, which was pushing for promotion to the Liga MX. He signed alongside compatriot José Madrid, and made his official debut for his new team on 11 October 2008 by playing the entire match against Irapuato.

On 27 April 2009, La Liga club Villarreal signed the 20-year-old Montero to a five-year contract effective from July. He contributed two goals and five assists as the Valencians trounced amateurs Navata 27–0 in a pre-season friendly. He made his competitive debut for the senior side in the Europa League round of 32 in February 2010, replacing Robert Pirès with 20 minutes left as Villarreal were eliminated by Wolfsburg, but spent the vast majority of his first season with the reserves as one of their most important attacking elements as they overachieved to finish seventh in their first season in the Segunda División.

Subsequently, Montero was promoted to the main squad as a complement for the more experienced Santi Cazorla and Cani. He made his top-flight debut in the opening fixture of the 2010–11 La Liga season, replacing Cani in a 0–1 loss at Real Sociedad.

Montero failed to find a regular first-team place at Villarreal, and moved to another La Liga club, Levante, in late January 2011 on loan for the rest of the season. He spent the following season on loan at another top-flight club, the newly promoted Real Betis. He scored his first goal of the campaign on 10 March 2012 in a 2–3 home defeat against Real Madrid. He was first choice throughout most of his tenure with the Pepe Mel-led squad, who managed to retain their league status.

On 15 June 2012, Montero was transferred to Monarcas Morelia of the Mexican top flight, on a three-year deal. He scored his first goal on 15 July against Club América, as well as making two assists. On 21 August, in the Copa MX contest against his former team Dorados, he scored a hat-trick in a 6–0 win.

On 4 January 2013, Montero scored the opening goal of the Clausura, in a 3–3 home draw against Cruz Azul, assisted by international team-mate Joao Rojas. After Rojas left Morelia, Montero was given the number 10 shirt, starting off the new campaign on 19 July with a goal and two assists in a 3–1 victory over Querétaro. His hat-trick the following weekend was in vain, as Morelia lost 4–3 at home to Toluca. He scored the opening goal in the Apertura 2013 Copa MX Final in which Morelia beat Atlas on penalties after the match finished as a 3–3 draw.

On 24 July 2014, Montero signed for Premier League team Swansea City on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He made his competitive debut on 16 August in the opening game of the season at Old Trafford, replacing Nathan Dyer after 67 minutes of a 2–1 win over Manchester United.

Montero joined Spanish top-division club Getafe on 1 September 2017 on loan for the season. In his first match of the 2017–18 La Liga campaign 20 days later, he played for 15 minutes in a 1–1 away draw with Celta. Having featured little for Getafe, Montero rejoined Emelec in late February 2018 where he completed his loan. On 2 June, he scored in the 3–0 victory against Técnico Universitario at Estadio George Capwell, 11 years after his last goal for the club. In his post-match interview he said he was "very happy for today's victory and for scoring for my team after so many years, forever grateful to God".

Montero made 13 substitute appearances for Swansea before joining 2018–19 Championship rivals West Bromwich Albion on 31 January 2019 on loan for the rest of the season. He played just four times and started once, away to Queens Park Rangers on 19 February, opening the scoring in a 3–2 win.

After a delay while issues with the paperwork were resolved, Montero was confirmed to have joined Championship club Birmingham City on loan for the 2019–20 season. He made his debut on 20 August as a late substitute in the 2–0 win over Barnsley, and produced a "sparkling ten minute cameo" that earned him 7 out of 10 in the "Birmingham Mail" player ratings.

Montero represented Ecuador at the 2007 Pan American Games, and scored in the final match against Jamaica, a 2–1 win which brought the first international trophy in Ecuadorian football history. He received his first senior call-up from coach Luis Fernando Suárez for an August 2007 friendly with Bolivia.

Montero made his senior debut for Ecuador on 21 November 2007 in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier at home to Peru, coming on late in the second half in a 5–1 win. He scored his first goal for the national team on 27 May 2009, in a 1–3 friendly loss to El Salvador, and his second came in the reverse fixture with Peru in Lima, which Ecuador won 2–1.

Montero was selected by national coach Reinaldo Rueda for his 2014 World Cup squad. He made his debut in the tournament on 15 June in a 1–2 group stage loss against Switzerland; he started and played 77 minutes.

Teemu Pukki

Teemu Eino Antero Pukki (; born 29 March 1990) is a Finnish professional footballer who plays as a striker for club Norwich City and the Finland national team. He began his career with KTP and made his debut on senior level in 23 June 2005 at the age of 15 in a fifth round match of the Finnish Cup. He then moved to Sevilla in 2008, where he played only one La Liga game for the first team before returning to Finland with HJK. He then played in the top divisions of Germany for Schalke 04, Scotland for Celtic and Denmark for Brøndby. In 2018 he signed for Norwich City on a free transfer and was named player of the season in the 2018–19 EFL Championship.

Pukki made his international debut for Finland in 2009 and has earned 80 caps, scoring 25 goals. He scored 10 goals in 10 matches in Finland´s UEFA Euro 2020 qualification, helping Finland reach their first ever international tournament.

Pukki began his football career in childhood in HOPS (Hovinsaaren Palloseura) while living in Hovinsaari, Kotka. As a youth he joined his official hometown club, KTP, playing for their under-19 side. He made his debut for the first team at 16 years old and his performances saw him called up to play for Finland's youth international sides. In two seasons of first-team football, Pukki made 29 appearances in the Finnish Premier League (Veikkausliiga) and scored three goals.

Pukki moved to Sevilla from KTP and was called up for the Sevilla first team for the away match against Real Madrid on 7 December 2008, but was an unused substitute. He received his La Liga debut at home against Racing on 25 January 2009. He found himself unused in Sevilla playing mostly for the reserve side Sevilla Atletico and he decided to return to Finland.

On 28 August 2010, Pukki signed a three-and-half-year contract with the Finnish Veikkausliiga club HJK. Pukki made his debut 30 August a match against IFK Mariehamn. He managed to score his first goal for HJK in the next match against FF Jaro which was his first goal in a league match for nearly two years. During season 2010 he managed to play in seven games and score two goals for HJK in the 2010 season. At the end of the season HJK and Pukki won the Finnish Veikkausliiga and silver in the Finnish Cup.

During season 2011 he scored 11 goals and notched eight assists in 18 league matches out of which he was in the starting line up in 13. He was chosen to 2011 Veikkausliiga All Stars -team. Pukki was also a key figure in HJK's UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League qualifications. He scored two goals against Bangor City and HJK's both goals in a 2–0 home win against FC Schalke 04. Pukki also scored HJK's only goal in the 6–1 away defeat against Schalke.

Pukki scored three goals in two matches against FC Schalke 04 in August 2011 during the Europa League qualifier. First he scored twice in the first leg in Helsinki, and in Gelsenkirchen he scored an away goal. However, it was not enough to help HJK qualify to the group stage. On 31 August 2011, Pukki joined Schalke on a three-year contract.

On 6 November, he scored two goals for Schalke as he debuted in the starting 11 against Hannover 96. By doing so, he became the third Finn to score a brace in the German Bundesliga, after Ari Hjelm and Pasi Rautiainen.

Pukki signed a four-year deal with Celtic from FC Schalke 04 for an undisclosed fee on 31 August 2013. He scored on his debut in a 3–1 win against Hearts on 14 September 2013 and again on his home debut against St Johnstone on 21 September. On 26 January 2014 he scored against Hibernian. Overall though, Pukki's first season at Celtic was considered something of a disappointment as he struggled with form and failed to fill the void left by Gary Hooper who had left at the start of the season. Pukki himself later acknowledged the lack of impact he had made, admitting he initially felt playing in Scotland would be "easier" than in Germany. He found the speed and physical nature of the game in Scotland difficult to adjust to, and stated "Scottish football is not easy. It’s not a bad league at all".

On 8 July 2014, Pukki scored his first Celtic hat trick in a pre-season friendly against LASK Linz in a 5–2 victory for Celtic. Pukki scored twice in Celtic's victory against KR Reykjavik at Murrayfield Stadium in Celtic's UEFA Champions League qualifying match, the match ended 4–0 with Celtic winning 5–0 on aggregate. However, he struggled to make any impact in the next qualifying round matches against Legia Warsaw and was substituted at half-time in the league defeat to Inverness Caledonian Thistle on 6 August 2014.

On 1 September 2014, Pukki signed a one-year loan deal with option to buy with Danish side Brøndby IF. He made his debut 13 days later in a league match at home against Randers and scored his first goal two weeks later in a 2–2 draw away against Esbjerg.

Steve Kean

Stephen Kean (born 30 September 1967) is a Scottish football manager and former player. A winger, he spent his playing career in the lower divisions of Scottish, English and Portuguese leagues in the 1980s and 1990s, before moving into coaching. After a 21-month spell in charge of Blackburn Rovers, he resigned on 28 September 2012.

Kean grew up in Cumbernauld, a new town on the outskirts of Glasgow, attending St. Maurice's High School. Upon leaving school, he joined Celtic as a professional, but was unable to break into a first team then dominated by Celtic legends Tommy Burns, Murdo MacLeod and Paul McStay.

He joined Swansea City on loan in 1987, at the same time as Chris Coleman. They formed a lasting professional relationship, which carried on after both of their playing days had ended.

Kean then played for Académica Coimbra in Portugal, making nine appearances, and scoring one goal in all competitions. During his time in Portugal, Kean also played for Naval.

Since retiring from playing Kean has worked as a coach for Reading, Fulham, Real Sociedad and Coventry City, working as an assistant to Chris Coleman at Fulham, Real Sociedad and Coventry.

In June 2008, it was reported that Kean was in talks with Chelsea to become assistant manager to Luiz Felipe Scolari. Kean's fluency in Portuguese from his playing days was believed to be a key reason for Chelsea's interest.

On 4 August 2009, Blackburn Rovers manager Sam Allardyce appointed Kean as his new first team coach. Kean replaced Karl Robinson who returned to Milton Keynes Dons. Allardyce commented that he had received numerous applications for the first team coaching position and Kean "stood out above the rest through his personality, experience and knowledge of football at the highest level".

After the sacking of Allardyce on 13 December 2010 by new Blackburn owners Venky's, Kean was initially installed as caretaker manager but on 22 December 2010, he was appointed manager on a contract until the end of the season to prove his abilities in that position. On 4 January 2011, it was revealed by Anuradha Desai, chairperson of Venky's, that Kean would be offered a new two-to-three-year long-term contract to manage the club and on 20 January 2011, it was confirmed by Blackburn that Kean had signed a contract until June 2013. Kean's appointment was shrouded in a great deal of controversy since his agent Jerome Anderson had earlier played a major role in advising Venky's during the takeover of the club in the preceding months. Furthermore, Allardyce later received "substantial", but undisclosed, damages from Kean after Kean had been recorded in a bar in Hong Kong falsely alleging that Allardyce had been sacked from his post at Blackburn Rovers because he was a crook.

Kean started brightly as manager, but ten games without a win saw Rovers dragged into relegation trouble. A 15th-place finish was secured with a 3–2 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on the final day of the 2010–11 Premier League season.

In November 2011, Blackburn confirmed that Kean had signed a new contract with improved terms, despite the club being in the bottom place of the league. This came despite Kean's comments less than a week earlier stating: "Yes, there have been discussions about a new contract, but I have told the owners that this is an inappropriate time to conclude any new contract discussions". The new deal came after months of protests at the club in which fans campaigned to have Kean removed as Rovers manager as he had recorded just one league win all season. At the time, Steve Kean was Blackburn Rovers' second worst manager since 1992, with only Paul Ince scoring a lower win percentage.

Further controversy was created when Kean admitted 'forfeiting' a League Cup quarter-final at Cardiff City for the sake of their league form, with fans subsequently demanding a refund for the ticket price, travel expenses and money lost due to not working on the day. In December 2011, the local newspaper and MP Jack Straw joined the fans in calling for Kean's resignation ahead of a crucial home match with Bolton Wanderers. Another defeat concluded Kean's first 38 league games as Blackburn manager in which he had amassed just 32 points and left Rovers bottom of the table at Christmas. Despite all of this, Kean remained defiant by insisting that he would stay in his job long enough to fashion a revival and that he would be "100% shocked" if he was sacked.

Results were somewhat improved in the second half of the season but five successive defeats in April dragged Rovers deep into relegation trouble again with Kean having recorded just 12 wins from his 55 league games since he took over. On 7 May 2012, a home loss against Wigan Athletic relegated Blackburn Rovers to the Football League Championship and ended an eleven-year run in the top flight.

Kean left his position as Rovers' manager on 28 September 2012 with the club third in the Championship table. He declared that he had been "forced to resign" and that his position had been "untenable".

In October 2013 Kean agreed a deal to become the new manager of S.League side DPMM FC. Kean signed an initial one-year contract with the club in Brunei on 28 November 2013. Brunei led the 2014 S.League for the majority of the campaign but ended up finishing as runners up to Warriors FC following a 2–1 defeat to Tampines Rovers on the final day of the season. They were also knocked out of the 2014 Singapore Cup in the semi-final by Home United. The team did lift some silverware however, as they won the 2014 Singapore League Cup, beating Tanjong Pagar United 2–0 in the final.

Kean was also appointed as the head coach of Brunei national football team for the 2014 AFF Suzuki Cup qualification tournament in Laos in October 2014.

Brunei DPMM clinched the S-League championship on 21 November 2015, with a 4–0 win at home to Balestier Khalsa.

In early November it was announced that Kean would leave Brunei DPMM at the end of the 2017 S.League season, a year before his contract with the club ended.

On 15 August 2011, Kean was convicted of drink driving at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court. The Court rejected his defence that his drinks had been spiked following a match against Manchester United. He was banned from driving for 18 months and fined £1,800.

Marvin Bartley

Marvin Clement Bartley (born 4 July 1986) is an English professional footballer, who plays for Scottish Premiership club Livingston as a midfielder. Early in his career, Bartley played for English non-league clubs Burnham, Hayes, Didcot Town and Hampton & Richmond Borough. He broke into the professional leagues in 2007 with Bournemouth, where he made over 100 Football League appearances. Soon after Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe moved to Burnley in 2011, Bartley followed Howe to Turf Moor.

Bartley fell out of favour at Burnley after Howe returned to Bournemouth in October 2012. He initially moved on loan to Leyton Orient, then joined Orient on a permanent basis after he was released by Burnley in January 2014. Bartley left Orient in the summer of 2015 and signed for Scottish club Hibernian. He helped Hibernian win the Scottish Cup in 2016 and promotion in 2017. After his contract with Hibernian expired in May 2019, Bartley signed for Livingston.

Born in Reading, Berkshire, Bartley started his career with his hometown club, Reading, playing in the youth setup before being released as a teenager. Bartley then joined the Hayes Football Education Development Opportunity (FEDO) program to help develop his skills, of which he graduated from in 2004. He then joined Southern Football League side Burnham where he played alongside his two brothers, Mark and Michael. He made his début for Burnham on 21 August 2004, coming on as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat to Evesham United. His final appearance came in a 3–2 defeat to Sutton Coldfield Town on 30 October. He made a total of eight appearances for the Blues, without scoring.

Bartley then made a swift return to his former club, Conference South side Hayes during the season along with his brother Mark. His début came on 12 February 2005, in a 3–2 away win over Sutton United. He finished the season as a first-team regular making a total of eight appearances for Hayes in the 2004–05 season as they finished mid-table. In May 2005, he signed a new two-year contract to stay at the club. His first appearance of the 2005–06 season was on 13 August 2005, in a 1–0 win over newly promoted Eastleigh. His first career goal came on 10 September, when he scored the second in a 2–0 victory over Bishop's Stortford. His second goal came on 12 November, when he scored the winner in a 2–1 away win at Carshalton Athletic. His final goal of the season and for Hayes came on 11 February 2006, when he scored the leveller in a 1–1 draw with Bognor Regis Town. Bartley remained a first team regular during the season making a total of 40 appearances, scoring three goals as they narrowly avoided relegation. His first game of the 2006–07 season came on 12 August 2006, in a 3–1 defeat to Histon. His final appearance for Hayes was on 12 September, when he came on as a substitute in a 3–2 defeat to Bognor Regis Town.

In September 2006, Bartley joined Southern League side Didcot Town. He scored on his début, coming off the bench to score the second in a 2–2 draw with Windsor & Eton on 24 September. Bartley made a total of two appearances for Didcot before signing for Isthmian League side Hampton & Richmond Borough on a free transfer in October 2006. His début came on 17 October, in a 2–2 draw away at Heybridge Swifts. He remained a first-team regular and on 24 April 2007 he made his final appearance for Hampton in the reverse fixture to Heybridge, which again finished 2–2. He made a total of 25 appearances for the Beavers as they were crowned champions and gained promotion to the Conference South.

Bartley was close to joining Football League Two side Milton Keynes Dons until manager Martin Allen departed for Leicester City, after spending a week on trial. In the summer of 2007, Bartley joined Football League One side Bournemouth on a two-week trial, playing in pre-season friendlies against Hamworthy United, Weymouth and Southampton. On 23 July, he signed a one-year professional contract after the successful trial, becoming the fourth new arrival. Prior to joining Bournemouth he had been combining his semi-professional career with installing double glazing for The Splash Group in Reading. He made his début for the Cherries on 1 December 2007, in the FA Cup second round defeat away to Millwall, coming on as a late substitute for Jo Kuffour. His league début came a week later where he again featured as a substitute, coming on for Jem Karacan in a 3–1 defeat to Tranmere Rovers at Prenton Park. On 26 January 2008, Bartley made his first start for Bournemouth in a 3–1 away win at Port Vale. He continued to be a first team regular in the team, scoring his first professional goal in a 2–2 draw with Cheltenham Town on 23 February. His final appearance of the season was on 3 May 2008, a 1–1 draw with Carlisle United as Bournemouth were relegated to League Two. Bartley made a total of 21 appearances in all competitions in the 2007–08 season, scoring one goal.

In December 2010, it was revealed that Bartley was subject of interest from AFC Wimbledon, Stevenage, AS Nancy, Havant & Waterlooville, Leeds United and Leicester City.

Following the move of Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe to Burnley just two weeks later on 30 January 2011, Burnley submitted a bid believed to be in the region of £350,000 for Bartley. Despite Bournemouth chairman Eddie Mitchell having previously stated that no Bournemouth players were leaving in the January transfer window, Bartley forced the move through by refusing to play for the Cherries again if the bid was rejected. As a result, a fee was agreed and Bartley became a Claret.

Under Howe, Bartley was a regular feature in match day squads for the rest of 2011, and he scored his first goal for Burnley against Blackpool in a 3–1 home victory, scoring the third and final goal of the match. Despite initially regularly featuring, Bartley soon found himself deployed more from the bench than in a starting role, losing his place to the more established midfield three of Dean Marney, Chris McCann and Brian Stock. The return of Howe to Bournemouth in October 2012 and the subsequent appointment of Sean Dyche further pushed Bartley away from a regular place in the squad.

In November 2012, the Jamaica Football Federation reported that Bartley had shown interest playing for Jamaica (the "Reggae Boyz") and that he was in the pool of players eligible for selection.

On 30 January 2014, Bartley terminated his contract with Burnley by mutual consent.

After falling out favour at Burnley, Bartley joined League One side Leyton Orient on an initial one-month loan deal on 1 August 2013. Following their excellent start to the 2013–14 season, his loan deal was extended. Bartley then joined Leyton Orient on a permanent basis in January 2014.

After eighteen months at Leyton Orient, Bartley joined Scottish Championship side Hibernian on 17 July 2015 on a two-year deal. Bartley was an unused substitute as Hibernian won the 2016 Scottish Cup Final, their first win in the competition for 114 years.

On 17 September 2016, Bartley was sent off against Ayr United, but had his red card overturned the following week. He was dismissed again on 15 October, against Raith Rovers, but this was also downgraded to a yellow card. Bartley explained that in order for the card to be rescinded completely, he would have had to miss a day of training to go to an appeal, which he was not willing to do. After helping the club win promotion to the Scottish Premiership in 2016–17, he signed a two-year contract with Hibs in May 2017.

In May 2019, Bartley signed a pre-contract agreement with Livingston.

During the 2019–20 season Bartley appeared as a pundit for coverage of Scottish football by BBC Scotland and BT Sport.

Bartley was born in England and is of Jamaican descent. He was fined £400 in November 2017 after he was found guilty of threatening a woman.

Diego Arismendi

Hugo Diego Arismendi Ciapparetta (born 25 January 1988) is a Uruguayan footballer who plays as a midfielder for Racing Montevideo.

Arismendi began his career with Nacional, one of Uruguay's leading clubs. His performances for Nacional in the Copa Libertadores earned him a call up to the Uruguay national team and to the attention of clubs in Europe. English Premier League side Stoke City signed Arismendi a fee of £2.6 million becoming the club's first South American player. However at Stoke he has failed to make any impact and has only been included in cup and European matches. He has also spent time out on loan at Brighton & Hove Albion, Barnsley and Huddersfield Town. After ending his unsuccessful time in England he returned to Uruguay.

On 29 August 2009 it was reported that Arismendi had agreed personal terms and passed a medical with Stoke City.
It was then announced late on 31 August 2009 that he had signed for a fee of £2.6 million possibly rising to £4.8 million. 

On 2 March 2010 Arismendi joined League One side Brighton & Hove Albion on loan linking up with fellow country man Gus Poyet. His time on the south coast was overshadowed by injury as he endured a miserable time which ended with a red card against MK Dons in his final game for the club. On 12 July 2010 Arismendi joined championship side Barnsley on a season long loan. He scored his first goal in English football against Leeds United in a 5–2 win for Barnsley. He returned to Stoke at the start of the 2011–12 season and whilst he has made the matchday squad a few occasions he has remained as an used substitute. He did make four appearances in the away matches in the UEFA Europa League including their final match against Valencia.

He joined Huddersfield Town on loan on 16 March 2012 until the end of the season. He made his debut for the "Terriers" the following day as a substitute in their 1–1 draw at Colchester United at the Colchester Community Stadium. His first start for the club came in the 1–0 home victory over league leaders Charlton Athletic on 24 March 2012.

Arismendi was left out of Stoke's 25-man squad for the 2012–13 season leaving his future certain to be away from the Britannia Stadium. His contract at Stoke was terminated at the end of November 2012 bringing an end to a poor three years at the club in which he managed just six appearances none of which came in a Premier League match. He returned to Uruguay and re-signed for Nacional.

He received his first international cap in a friendly match against Norway on 28 May 2008 followed up by his second in a World Cup qualifier against Bolivia both games finished 2–2.

Whilst living in England, Arismendi was branded a 'noise pest' after forcing his neighbour to move due to hosting late night parties.

He deputised for Millington away to Brighton & Hove Albion on 13 September 1975, but had a debut to forget as Chester lost 6–0. Chester then signed Barry Watling on loan from Hartlepool until Millington returned to the side the following month and Craven had to wait until the start of the following season for his next first-team outing.

He played in Chester's first three league games of the 1976–77 season and in a Football League Cup defeat to Swansea City on 31 August 1976 that marked the end of Ken Roberts' eight-year spell as Chester manager. Apart from a Welsh Cup tie against Shrewsbury Town, Craven made no further first-team appearances for Chester until the climax to the season. He played in both legs of the first Debenhams Cup final against Port Vale due to Millington being injured. Chester overturned a 2–0 deficit from the first-leg to win 4–3 on aggregate and present Craven with a winners medal.

He made no more first-team appearances for Chester, who quickly signed the experienced Brian Lloyd as competition for Millington. This marked the end of Craven's professional career, as he joined non-league side Bangor City.

John Taylor (English footballer, born 1949)

John Taylor (born 25 June 1949, Birmingham) is an English former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He played in The Football League for three clubs during the 1970s.

Taylor began his professional career with Chester, who he joined from Pwllheli in July 1970, in a summer that also saw fellow youngsters Alan Groves, Dave Kennedy and Brian Woodall and the experienced Dave Pountney arrive at the Fourth Division club. Although he made his debut for Chester against Peterborough United on 31 October 1970, Taylor managed just seven league appearances in his first two seasons at the club as he acted as reserve to Terry Carling and then Gordon Livsey.

He finally established himself at the club during the 1972–73 season, as he recovered from a pre–season injury to play in the final 40 league games of the season. He played in the opening 18 games of the following season, but the signing of Grenville Millington led to Taylor losing his place and he managed just five more league starts. In the 1974–75 season (when Chester won promotion from the Football League Fourth Division and reached the semi–finals of the Football League Cup), Taylor was restricted to a solitary Welsh Cup outing against Oswestry Town as he brought his Chester career to a close. During the season, he had a short loan stint with Rochdale, where he played three games.

After a spell with non-league side Bangor City, Taylor returned to The Football League with Stockport County in November 1975. Just one league appearance was added to his career tally and he joined Worcester City.

James Cookson (6 December 1904 – December 1970), better known as Jimmy Cookson, was an English footballer who played as a centre forward in the Football League for Manchester City, Chesterfield, West Bromwich Albion, Plymouth Argyle and Swindon Town.

Cookson was born in Manchester. He began his career as a wing half with South Salford Lad's Club and then played for Clayton and Manchester North End. He turned professional with Manchester City in August 1923, but was unable to break into the first team and was sent to Southport on loan for a trial period in 1924. He was transferred to Chesterfield in April 1925, and converted to a centre forward. He was the leading goalscorer in the Third Division North for the 1925–26 season with 44 goals, and scored 85 overall in 74 league appearances. In August 1927, he joined West Bromwich Albion for a £2,500 fee. He continued to score goals at his new club and was a member of the 1930–31 squad that won the FA Cup and promotion to the First Division. Later in 1931, Cookson was selected for the Football Association tour of Canada.

He scored 103 league goals in 122 matches for Albion, including six in a Second Division game against Blackpool in 1927.

Cookson maintained his high goalscoring ratio after joining Second Division club Plymouth Argyle in 1933. He scored 28 goals in his first season with Argyle, including 27 in 29 league appearances, but injuries restricted his playing time over the next two campaigns. Cookson managed a further 10 goals in 17 matches to bring his overall tally to 38 goals in 48 games. He moved to Swindon Town in 1936, where he played on for two more seasons, and scored 31 goals in 50 league appearances. Cookson retired from the game in May 1938 to become a publican.

Cookson's Football League record of 256 goals scored in 292 appearances is one of the best in the League's history. His great quality was a willingness to shoot, and shoot early, whenever a chance presented itself. Cookson died in Warminster in December 1970.

Percy Dawson (footballer)

Percival Hall Dawson (born 4 December 1889 – 1974) was an English footballer who played as a centre forward. He played in the Scottish Football League for Heart of Midlothian and in the English Football League for Blackburn Rovers, moving between them in 1914 for what is believed to be a record transfer fee at the time.

Dawson was born in Cullercoats. Early on in his football career, he played for non-league sides Whitley Athletic and North Shields before moving to Scottish club Heart of Midlothian in 1911. In 1913, however, Hearts were required to sell Dawson in order to fund improvements to their Tynecastle Stadium, and he was transferred to Blackburn Rovers for a fee of £2,500 – a fee which several sources claim was a then world record transfer fee.

In his first season with Blackburn, he contributed to the club winning the English First Division, and helped them to a third-place finish the following season.

The outbreak of World War I brought about an end to professional football in England for four seasons. After serving as a sergeant in the Royal Garrison Artillery during the war, Dawson returned to Blackburn and remained with the club until 1922. He played four matches for Barrow in 1923 before retiring from football.

Thomas "Tommy" Astbury (9 February 1920 – 19 October 1993) was a Welsh professional footballer. Born in Buckley, he spent his entire professional career with Chester from 1938 to 1955. He is one of the club’s top 10 Football League appearance holders with 303 such appearances to his name, with a high number of wartime league appearances having also been made.

Astbury, a wing half who also played as a forward, joined Chester as a part-time professional in 1938 after being spotted playing for Mold Alexandra. The outbreak of the Second World War the following year put his league career on hold but quickly shot Astbury into the first-team ranks, playing in the first wartime match against Liverpool. He went on to play regularly throughout the war years and was rewarded with two wartime Welsh caps against England in 1945. He also guested for Everton, Wrexham and Manchester United, playing for the latter in the northern final of the Football League War Cup.

When peacetime league football resumed in August 1946, Astbury was included in the Chester line-up at York City on the first day of the new season in a 4–4 draw. Later in the season he scored in a 2–0 FA Cup win against Plymouth Argyle that set up a fourth round tie with Stoke City, featuring Stanley Matthews. Astbury was involved in the goalless draw at a packed Sealand Road and the 3–2 defeat in the replay. He ended the season by scoring for Chester in their third and final Welsh Cup victory against Merthyr Tydfil.

One of Astbury’s finest hours came against Hull City on 6 November 1948 when he performed superbly against the great Raich Carter despite being on the losing side. He remained prominently involved in the Chester side for most of his remaining years at the club, playing his final game in a 2–0 defeat against Rochdale on 11 April 1955. He retired from playing at the end of the season. While at Chester, Astbury had enjoyed a benefit match against Bolton Wanderers on 6 April 1949.

After leaving football, Astbury worked for a building supplies firm and was an ex-captain and lifelong vice-president of Hawarden Golf Club.

Brian Hornsby

Brian Hornsby (born 10 September 1954) is an English former football player who played for Arsenal, Shrewsbury Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Carlisle United in the English league. He also had short spells playing abroad for Edmonton Drillers (Canada), IK Brage (Sweden) and Falu BS (Sweden) for whom he was player-manager. Hornsby was an attacking midfielder playing 222 English league games and scoring 48 goals. His career was seriously curtailed by a hamstring injury when playing for Sheffield Wednesday in 1980.

As a schoolboy Brian captained Peterborough Boys and earned England caps at School boy and Youth level.

Hornsby joined Arsenal straight from school in 1970, he was member of the Arsenal team which won the FA Youth Cup in 1971, beating Cardiff City 2–0 over two legs. He signed as a professional for Arsenal in September 1971. Arsenal had just won The Double in the 1970–71 season and had a very strong team. Hornsby's chances of breaking into the first team were very rare and he did not make his debut until May 1973 in the final league game of the 1972–73 season in a 1–6 defeat at Leeds United. He was very much a reserve and squad player for the Gunners making only 26 league appearances in his almost five seasons at Highbury, scoring six goals. Hornsby was released by Arsenal at the end of Bertie Mee's reign as manager and he signed for Shrewsbury Town in May 1976 for £40,000.

Hornsby while playing under Shrewsbury boss Alan Durban and was virtually ever present during his almost two years at Gay Meadow playing in 75 league games and scoring 16 goals. He helped Town win the Welsh Cup in 1977. In February 1978 Durban left to be manager of Stoke City and the following month Hornsby signed for Sheffield Wednesday in a £45,000 deal.

Sheffield Wednesday manager Jack Charlton had been tracking Hornsby for some time and he finally got his man. There is a famous anecdote regarding Hornsby which sums up Charlton's laconic personality. Wednesday were playing Shrewsbury away at the end of February 1978, just before Hornsby's move to Sheffield. Charlton was giving his pre-match team talk and midway through turned to Wednesday midfielder Jeff Johnson and said, "You're up against the lad Hornsby, he's a very skilful player ... I'm buying him to replace you". As it happened there was room for both Hornsby and Johnson in the Wednesday team.

Hornsby made his debut for Wednesday on 18 March 1978 in a 1–3 away defeat to Lincoln City, however after that Wednesday only suffered one more defeat in the remaining 12 matches that season. On signing, Hornsby had said on local radio that he would score plenty of goals from midfield, his first came on 25 March in a 2–0 away win at Rotherham. It was a 25-yard volley into the roof of the net which was named as Goal of the Season on Yorkshire Television by Martin Tyler. Jeff Johnson scored the other goal that day.

The 1978–79 season saw Hornsby finish as top scorer for Wednesday with 21 goals in all competitions including three in the FA Cup 3rd round marathon against former club Arsenal. 1979–80 saw Wednesday promoted from Division Three but Hornsby's goal contribution was only three, missing a third of the matches through injury. The following season (1980–81) in Division Two started well for Hornsby scoring three goals in 12 matches, however in October 1980 he suffered a troublesome hamstring problem and missed the rest of the season. Brian only made only one more appearance for Wednesday, as a substitute at Chelsea in December 1981. A few weeks earlier he had made four appearances for Chester City on loan.

Brian spent part of 1982 playing for the Canadian NASL team Edmonton Drillers but returned to England after they hit financial trouble and folded. He signed for Carlisle United in the summer of 1982 and spent two years there, making only 10 appearances and scoring one goal against Newcastle United, described as "a brilliant chip over Kevin Carr" by one football writer. in November 1982. After a brief spell on loan at Chesterfield, Hornsby moved to Sweden in 1984 to play for IK Brage for a season, making 20 appearances and scoring 1 goal. He then moved to the town of Falun to be player-manager of Falu BS (Bollsällskap). On returning to the UK he played non-League football for Spalding United and Holbeach United.

Brian now lives in Peterborough . For more than 15 years he has been captain of the Arsenal F.C. former professionals and celebrity team raising money for charities and the Arsenal Trust. He is also involved with the charity Action Medical Research and along with friend Tony Hadley undertook a trek to Machu Picchu to raise funds for the charity.

Bob Glendenning

Robert Glendenning (6 June 1888 – 19 November 1940) was an English professional footballer, who played as a wing half for several English clubs prior to and just after the First World War. He later went on to coach in the Netherlands, including coaching the Dutch national side.

He started his career at hometown club Washington United before transferring to Barnsley sometime prior to 1910. He played in both FA Cup finals that Barnsley reached, in 1910 and 1912. In the first Barnsley lost in the replay to Newcastle United. The second also went to a replay but Barnsley won, defeating West Bromwich Albion by one goal in extra time. The "Manchester Guardian" praised his play in the first match, and in the replay Glendenning won the ball from a West Brom player and passed it to Harry Tufnell to score in the last minutes of extra time.

In March 1913 he transferred to Bolton Wanderers, for whom he played a total of 83 games as club captain. Bolton reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1915, in which they were defeated by Sheffield United captained by George Utley, Glendenning's fellow wing half from Barnsley. In the 1916–17 season, Glendinning appeared as a wartime guest player with Burnley. After the war he played for Accrington Stanley.

After the end of his playing career he took up coaching and moved to the Netherlands.
He had a short spell, only one game, a 4–1 victory over Switzerland, as coach of the national side in 1923.
He then coached Koninklijke HFC until 1928. He was made the permanent coach of the Netherlands in 1925, holding both coaching positions until the 1928 Summer Olympics when he chose to focus on the national team.
He remained the manager of the Oranje until 1940, leading them to the World Cup finals in 1934 and 1938. The tournaments would be disappointments, exiting in the first round on both occasions, to Switzerland by a score of 3–2, in 1934, and then to Czechoslovakia by 3–0, in 1938.
Glendenning managed the Oranje through 87 games, with 36 wins, 36 losses and 15 draws.

Up until October 2017, he remained the Dutch national coach with the most victories. By comparison, the only Dutch coach Rinus Michels to win a major trophy, Euro 1988, had 30 victories from 53 games, over an 18-year (1974 to 1992) on again off again association with the national team. Marco van Basten had 35 wins from 48 games before being knocked out at the quarter final stage of Euro 2008. However, as of his 3rd spell in charge, Dick Advocaat has now managed 37 victories from 62 games.

Glendenning's last game as a manager was the 4–2 victory over Belgium played on 21 April 1940; the game was also Abe Lenstra's second international cap. Three weeks later the Dutch national side were in Luxembourg to play their next international match, but the game was never played because of the German invasion of the Netherlands.
He died on 19 November of that same year. He is buried in Bolton (England) where the KNVB has maintained and replaced his headstone.

Michael Townsend

Michael John Townsend (born 17 May 1986) is an English footballer who plays for side Stratford Town, where he plays as a defender.

Townsend started his career at Wolverhampton Wanderers as a youth team player where he signed a three-year scholarship. He impressed in the youth teams and was quickly promoted to the reserve side where he established himself as a regular for two seasons. Having not made the breakthrough into the first team Townsend was released by manager Dave Jones at the end of the 2003–04 season.

Townsend then joined Cheltenham Town on a free transfer in January 2005. He became a regular in the Cheltenham team the following season, he appeared 35 times in his first season in defence.

It was a successful season which saw Cheltenham promoted into League One, Townsend went on to make 70 appearances for Cheltenham at this level scoring twice.

Following a lengthy period of injury Townsend returned to regain his place in the Cheltenham side alongside Shane Duff, and helping Cheltenham to avoid relegation. As of August 2009, Townsend has made 140 appearances for Cheltenham Town.

He joined Barnet on a months loan in October 2008, the loan was then extended after a few good performances.

Townsend turned down the chance of rejoining Barnet on loan in early 2009 and vowed to fight for a place in the Cheltenham Town team. Shortly afterwards Cheltenham Town manager Martin Allen commented that some players at the club would rather sit on the bench and waste their careers than go out to another club and play football. However, through a mixture of attitude, hard work and determination, he had re-established himself as a key member of the Cheltenham Town defence by September 2009 following several man of the match performances at the end of the 2008–09 and the start of the 2009–10 seasons, including three goals.

He was released by the club along with seven other players in May 2010.

On 15 July 2010, he signed a two-year deal with Hereford United. On 25 January 2012, Townsend then signed an extension to his contract to keep him at Edgar Street after several strong performances, he scooped the 'Players Player' of the year award and made more appearances than any other player for the second consecutıve year.

Townsend was released by Hereford United at the end of the 2012–13 season after making only seven league appearances due to injury.

After rehab from injury Townsend joined Conference National side Tamworth on 9 January 2014 as Dale Belford looked to bolster his defensive options. His first game was against Rugby Town in the Birmingham Senior Cup, a match that Tamworth won 1–0.

Townsend went on to make six league appearances for Tamworth during the 2013–14 season, before fracturing a vertebra in the 2–1 defeat at home to Forest Green Rovers on 15 March 2014. This injury ruled him out for the remainder of the season, a season in which Tamworth were relegated to the Conference North.

Townsend was the first player to commit to Tamworth for the 2014–15 Conference North season. Shortly before the start of the Conference North season, manager Dale Belford unveiled Townsend as the club captain.

Townsend moved to Dales Lane after deciding to leave Tamworth to link up with former coach Richard Sneekes.

Sneekes admitted to admiring Townsend after working closely with him at Hereford United in League 2 and quickly installed him in the middle of his defence and has also used him in a central midfield.

A local lad, Townsend reviled in the press that Rushall was his very first club as a boy and is enjoying his football back at 'home'.

On 19 January 2018, Rushall Olympic manager Liam McDonald announced the return to Michael Townsend to the club.

It was announced on 8 August 2019, that Chasetown has signed Michael.

Townsend signed for Hinckley, and was named in the matchday squad for a Midland League Division One fixture away at Nuneaton Griff on 2 November 2019, a game in which his new side won 2-1.

Michael's stay with the club was a short lived one, as his departure was announced by the club on 6 November 2019, with just the one appearance to his name.

On 9 November 2019, Southern League Premier Central side Coalville Town announced the signing Townsend. On the same day the club announced the departure of Charlie Jemson to divisional rivals Peterborough Sports.

After a short spell with Walsall Wood, Townsend returned to the Southern League Premier Central on 1 February 2020, when he joined Stratford Town.

Jake Livermore

Jake Cyril Livermore (born 14 November 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for club West Bromwich Albion and the English national team.

He began his career at Tottenham Hotspur, spending most of his tenure out on loan at clubs in all three divisions of the English Football League. In 2013, he moved to Hull City, initially on a temporary basis, becoming permanent at the end of the season. After amassing 144 appearances for the "Tigers" in all competitions, he joined West Bromwich Albion in January 2017.

Livermore earned his first cap for the England national team in August 2012 in a friendly win against Italy.

Livermore was born in Enfield, Greater London, and attended Enfield Grammar School.

Livermore's career started in Tottenham Hotspur's academy in 2006, making 39 appearances for the under-18 team and scoring nine goals. He made another 13 appearances for the reserves. On 29 February 2008, he joined Milton Keynes Dons on a month-long loan deal. He made his professional debut the following day in a 1–0 win over Chester City at Stadium MK, playing the last 14 minutes in place of Jordan Hadfield. Livermore played five matches for the League Two club, all as a substitute.

On 11 July 2008, he was loaned for six months to League One club Crewe Alexandra. However, in a friendly with Conference Premier team Wrexham, he fractured his fibula and subsequently returned to Tottenham to receive treatment which kept him sidelined for a protracted spell. Livermore signed a new two-year deal with Tottenham on 24 July 2009.

He joined Championship club Derby County on an initial one-month loan on 10 August 2009. He scored his first league goal against Nottingham Forest in a 3–2 away defeat on 29 August. In January 2010, he joined another club in the division, Peterborough United, until the end of the 2009–10 season. He scored his first goal for Peterborough in a 2–1 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday on 23 January. On 2 March, he was recalled from his loan due to a spate of injuries to the Tottenham squad. Livermore made his competitive debut for Tottenham in a 2–1 win against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium on 20 March, coming on in added time for Niko Kranjčar.

On 23 September 2010, he was loaned out to Championship club Ipswich Town until January. On 24 March 2011, he was loaned out to Leeds United of the same division ahead of their final eight league matches and battle for promotion to the Premier League. On 2 April, Livermore made his debut for Leeds as a second-half substitute against Nottingham Forest where he had a hand in Leeds' fourth goal scored by Max Gradel. He was given a start against Reading, however he was substituted at half time after picking up a yellow card and lucky not to receive another for a tackle in the first half.

Livermore stayed with Tottenham for the 2011–12 season, scoring his first senior goal for Spurs on 18 August 2011 in the 5–0 UEFA Europa League qualifying win away against Heart of Midlothian, and ultimately made 38 appearances across all competitions.

Livermore moved to Hull City at the beginning of 2013–14 on a season-long loan, along with teammate Tom Huddlestone. He made his debut on the first day of the season when he came off the bench for Danny Graham in the 59th minute of a 2–0 loss away at Chelsea. On 1 December, he scored his first Premier League and Hull goal, opening a 3–1 home win over Liverpool with a shot deflecting off Martin Škrtel, Hull's first ever victory over the Merseyside opponents.

Hull reached the 2014 FA Cup Final, and Livermore started the match against Arsenal, which resulted in a 3–2 defeat at Wembley Stadium after extra time. In the close season, he joined Hull permanently for an undisclosed fee, one which was reported to have broken the club transfer record.

Following a 2–0 win against Crystal Palace in April 2015, Livermore was selected for a random drugs test. He tested positive for cocaine and, on 15 May 2015, was suspended by both the FA and Hull City for the remainder of the season. In August, Hull manager Steve Bruce revealed that Livermore had taken the substance to cope with the grief caused by the death of his newborn child shortly after the FA Cup final. In September 2015, a disciplinary hearing decided that the Football Association provisional ban would not be extended, as a result, his suspension by Hull City was also lifted.

At the start of the 2016–17 season, newly promoted Hull had only one fully fit recognised centre-back in Curtis Davies, so Livermore was selected to play as a centre-back alongside Davies.

Livermore joined Hull's fellow Premier League club West Bromwich Albion on a four-and-a-half-year deal on 20 January 2017 for a fee reported to be £10 million. He made his debut the following day in a 2–0 win against Sunderland at The Hawthorns, coming off the bench in place of James Morrison for the last 20 minutes of the match.

On 2 January 2018, Livermore had an altercation with a West Ham United fan at the London Stadium; he reported that the fan had taunted him about his son who died in infancy in 2014. The FA did not punish Livermore for the incident but warned him that such reactions could endanger himself and other fans. The West Ham fan was given an indefinite ban from the stadium.

In his 50th game for the Baggies on 21 April 2018, Livermore scored his first goal for the club as they came from behind to draw 2–2 with Liverpool. Two weeks later, he scored the only goal of a home win over his former team Tottenham, saving his team from immediate relegation.

Livermore made his first senior appearance for England in a 2–1 friendly win against Italy on 15 August 2012 at the Stade de Suisse in Bern, coming on as a substitute in the 69th minute for Frank Lampard.

After nearly five years away from international football, Livermore was recalled to the England squad in March 2017 by manager Gareth Southgate for a friendly match against Germany and a 2018 World Cup qualifier against Lithuania. He subsequently made his first start for England in a 1–0 away defeat to Germany on 22 March. Livermore was again called up by Southgate in May 2017 for a World Cup qualifier against Scotland, and a friendly against France.

On 16 May 2018, he was one of 5 players named on standby for the 23-man England national team squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Billy Frith

William Frith (9 June 1912 – 1996) was an English football player and manager.

Starting his career with Worksop Town, Mansfield Town, and Chesterfield; he won a move to Coventry City in 1932. He stayed with the club right up until the outbreak of World War II, helping the club to finish 1935–36 as Third Division South champions, and played a total of 165 games for the club in the Football League.

In 1945 he was appointed as manager of Port Vale, before he returned to Coventry as manager in 1947. His time at both clubs was unsuccessful, and he spent the next decade in non-league football as manager of Stafford Rangers and Rugby Town. He returned to Coventry as manager in 1957 and led the club to promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1958–59, but was sacked in 1961. His last management post was at Chelmsford City between 1963 and 1965, he led the club to second in the Southern League in 1963–64.

Frith played as a wing half for non-league sides Worksop Town and Mansfield Town. He transferred to Second Division side Chesterfield in 1932, scoring three goals in nine league games, before he moved on to Coventry City later in the year. He remained in Harry Storer's team up until the outbreak of World War II. During this time Coventry finished second in the Third Division South in 1933–34, though were not promoted. They did achieve promotion at the end of the 1935–36 campaign, after topping the division, one point ahead of chasers Luton Town. Coventry finished in fourth place in the Second Division in the two pre-war seasons, missing out on promotion to the First Division by one point in 1937–38 and four points in 1938–39. Frith made a total of 172 League appearances for Coventry City in two spells.

Frith was appointed manager of Port Vale in August 1945. The 1945–46 season was uneventful and he seemed to settle into management quite well. In preparation for the first season of post-war football, he signed experienced forward Colin Lyman from Tottenham Hotspur for 'fairly substantial fee', full-back Garth Butler from Derby County, and half-back Norman Hallam from Chelsea. He sold goalkeeper Arthur Jepson to Stoke City for £3,750. However, after a poor start to the season, he resigned in October 1946 over a policy difference with the club's directors. He claimed the board refused to back his suggestions for new players, interfered in team selection and failed to grant him a three-year contract – claims which the club denied. The "Valiants" went on to finish the 1946–47 campaign in tenth place in the Third Division South under Gordon Hodgson.

After leaving Port Vale, Frith returned to Highfield Road as assistant to Dick Bayliss, and also played seven league games. Following Bayliss' death, Frith was appointed as manager of Coventry City in August 1947, remaining in that position until November 1948. Coventry finished the 1947–48 Second Division season in tenth place, and went on to end the 1948–49 season just two points above the relegation zone under Harry Storer's stewardship.

Following spells in charge at non-league clubs Stafford Rangers and Rugby Town, he rejoined Coventry City as a coach and was once again appointed manager in September 1957. His side ended 1957–58 in nineteenth place in the Third Division South, and so were invited to become founder members of the Fourth Division in 1958–59. He then took the club to a second-place finish in 1958–59, four points behind champions Port Vale, his former club; City were therefore promoted into the Third Division.

His side flirted with the prospect of a second successive promotion in 1959–60, but ultimately finished in fifth place. They failed to push for promotion in 1960–61, and ended the campaign in fifteenth place. On what was known as 'Black Saturday', 25 November 1961, Coventry were dumped out of the FA Cup by non-league King's Lynn, and Frith was sacked by chairman Derrick Robins. He was replaced by Jimmy Hill, who took Coventry to a fourteenth-place finish in 1961–62. He later managed Chelmsford City, and led the "Clarets" to second and fifth-place finishes in the Southern League in 1963–64 and 1964–65.

Jack Cooper (born 1889) was a footballer who played for Barnsley and Newport County. He was a goalkeeper.

Cooper was a member of the Barnsley side who won the FA Cup in 1912 beating West Bromwich Albion in the replay after the first match ended goalless.

Kevin Bremner

Kevin Johnston Bremner (born 7 October 1957) is a Scottish former professional footballer who played as a striker. He made nearly 450 appearances in the English and Scottish Football Leagues, representing ten different clubs.

Bremner was born in Banff, which is now in Aberdeenshire. He began his senior career as an 18-year-old with home-town club Deveronvale of the Highland League; he had been with the club since he was 14 years of age. In the 1978–79 season, he was part of the team which defeated Huntly to win the Bell's Cup; he finished the season as leading scorer with 27 goals and won the club's player of the year award. Celtic manager Billy McNeill had invited him for a two-week trial, but no contract offer ensued and Bremner left Deveronvale for fellow Highland League club Keith.

In October 1980 he moved to England to join Colchester United of the Third Division for a fee of £40,000; that season Colchester were relegated to the Fourth Division. Bremner played more than 100 matches for the club in all competitions, and during the 1982–83 season he spent short periods on loan at Birmingham City, Wrexham and Plymouth Argyle, scoring a goal for each. In February 1983 he joined Millwall for £25,000. His first goal for the club gave him the distinction of having played and scored in the Football League for five different clubs in the same season.

Bremner played more than 100 games in all competitions for Millwall, helping them gain promotion to the Second Division as Third Division runners-up. At the beginning of the 1984–85 season he joined Reading; as the clubs were unable to agree on a transfer fee, the Football League tribunal valued his services at £35,000. In his second season at the club, he contributed to Reading winning the Third Division title, before joining Brighton & Hove Albion, where for the third time in four seasons he played his part in his club gaining promotion from the Third Division. He finished the season as the club's leading scorer, with 12 goals in all competitions.

He spent a season at Peterborough United before returning to Scotland where he signed for Dundee, contributing to their First Division title in 1991–92. A short spell on loan at Shrewsbury Town preceded his first foray into management, as player-manager of Highland League club Brora Rangers. He then rejoined Deveronvale as player-manager for one season, in which he was leading goalscorer with 17 goals and managed them to victory in the Aberdeenshire Shield.

Bremner returned to England to take up a coaching role at Gillingham, where he became youth team manager, but was made redundant in April 2003 along with other staff as a cost-cutting measure. He made one playing appearance for the club in 1995 in a Football League Trophy match.

His older brother Des was also a prominent professional footballer, with Hibernian, Aston Villa and Birmingham City.

Frank Cresswell

Frank Cresswell (born 5 September 1908, South Shields; died 1979) was an English former professional footballer who played as a forward. He made appearances in The Football League for four clubs between 1926 and 1938.

Frank, the brother of England international Warney Cresswell, was with local non–league side Tyne Dock and then at Football League side South Shields before moving to First Division side Sunderland in time for the 1926–27 season. He made 13 appearances for the Black Cats over the next three years and then spent a season playing for Second Division side West Bromwich Albion.

In 1930, Cresswell joined Cheshire County League side Chester after a spell with Connah's Quay Nomads, one of several signings ahead of the 1930–31 season made by new manager Charlie Hewitt as Chester became known as the 'Arsenal of the North'. Cresswell scored 27 goals as Chester finished runners–up to Port Vale Reserves and were elected to The Football League.

Cresswell had been contracted to West Brom during the season due to the transfer system in place at the time and officially joined Chester in time for their first season in The Football League in part–exchange for the prolific Arthur Gale. Cresswell helped create Chester's first goal in Division Three North against Wigan Borough and played regularly in the number 10 shirt before being transferred to Second Division side Notts County midway through 1933–34 for £2,500. But he returned to Sealand Road at the start of the following season after struggling to settle at his new club.

The 1935–36 season saw Chester finish runners–up in Division Three North, with Cresswell scoring twice in a club record 12–0 win over York City on 1 February 1936. But the following month saw him suffer a broken kneecap in a match against Walsall. Some fans felt this injury cost Chester the championship. He did not play for two years, with five league games in the closing stages of 1937–38 bringing to an end his playing career. This brief return to action included a goal in a 2–1 derby win over Wrexham to take his club league tally to 57, which is Chester's ninth highest in Football League matches.

Jackie Scott

John "Jackie" Scott (22 December 1933 – June 1978), also known as Jack Scott or Johnny Scott, was a former Northern Ireland international footballer and football manager who played as an outside forward for Manchester United, Grimsby Town and York City in the 1950s and 1960s.

Born in Belfast, Scott played football for Boyland Youth Club and Ormond Star in Northern Ireland, before moving to England as an apprentice with Manchester United. He signed his first professional contract with United in October 1951, and made his debut a year later, playing on the left wing in a 6–2 defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers on 4 October 1952. However, due to the competition for places in the Manchester United first team, Scott's appearances were few and far between, having made just three appearances when he left for Grimsby Town in June 1956.

Scott flourished at Grimsby, his performances catching the attention of the Northern Irish selectors, who called him up for a B international in 1957, before naming him in the squad for the 1958 World Cup. However, that was to be the end of his involvement with the Northern Irish national team as he was not selected again.

Scott played for Grimsby for a total of seven seasons, making 250 appearances in all competitions and scoring 54 goals. In 1963, he was allowed to leave the club on a free transfer to York City. He played for York for one season before dropping out of the Football League to play for Margate in the Southern League. In two seasons at Margate, he played in 95 matches and scored 26 goals, before retiring to Manchester.

Scott played in two matches at the 1958 FIFA World Cup; a 2–1 victory over Czechoslovakia and a 4–0 defeat to France in the quarter-finals.

Scott was killed in a building site accident in 1978, aged 44.

Dickie Downs

John Thomas "Dickie" Downs was a footballer who played for Barnsley and Everton. He was a Full Back

Dickie Downs played for Barnsley between 1909 & 1912 and was a member of the team who contested the 1910 FA Cup Final against Newcastle but lost after forcing a replay. He won a FA Cup winners medal in 1912 when Barnsley beat West Bromwich Albion in another replay after the first match ended goalless. The Manchester Guardian, when reporting on both 1912 matches, selected him as one of the better players on the pitch.

Downs' career was broken by the first world war but he returned to Oakwell in 1919 and yet again proved an annoyance to West Bromwich Albion in 1920 when Barnsley knocked them out of the F A cup.

By now Downs was thirty-three years of age and his performances in the cup alerted the top flight clubs that he was still good enough to play at the highest level. Downs had rejected many offers to step up during his career in the hope of gaining promotion with Barnsley but when Everton approached him after Barnsley's second round cup exit at the end of January 1920 he recognised it as his last chance and accepted a move to the First Division. Downs was an ever-present in his first full season at Goodison Park and went on to make ninety-two First Division appearances over five years but by 1923 he was finding it increasingly difficult to get into the first eleven and accepted an offer to step down into the third division with Brighton

Downs' first season among the elite clubs was a success and brought him to the attention of the International selectors playing for England in a Home Championship game against Ireland on 23 October 1920 at Roker Park. England won 2–0.

Jeff Minton

Jeffrey Simon Thompson Minton (born 28 December 1973) is an English former professional footballer who plays as a midfielder. He scored 49 goals in 296 league and cup games in a ten-year career in the Football League.

He began his career at Tottenham Hotspur, but only made two Premier League appearances before being allowed to join Brighton & Hove Albion in July 1994. He made 199 appearances for the "Seagulls", and was voted onto the PFA Team of the Year (Third Division) in 1998–99. He moved on to Port Vale in June 1999, but did not establish himself in the first team. He was transferred to Rotherham United in March 2001, and helped the "Millers" to win promotion out of the Second Division, before signing with Leyton Orient in July 2001. He joined non-league Grays Athletic in August 2002, before quickly moving on to Canvey Island. He helped the "Gulls" to the Isthmian League title in 2003–04, following their second-place finish in 2002–03, and also played in the 2004 FA Trophy Final. He moved onto Chelmsford City in August 2006, and helped his new side to the Isthmian League title in 2007–08. He signed with Welling United in July 2009, but left the club a month later. He joined amateur side Ware in November 2012.

Minton began his professional career as a trainee with Tottenham Hotspur in 1992. He scored on his debut, a 3–3 draw with Everton at White Hart Lane, which was also Gary Lineker and Paul Gascoigne's last home game for "Spurs". He was only to make two further appearances however, one Premier League and one League Cup game.

He was released in July 1994 and joined Brighton & Hove Albion of the Second Division on a free transfer. The "Seagulls" finished 16th in 1994–95 under the stewardship of Liam Brady. However rookie boss Jimmy Case could not prevent the club from suffering relegation to the Third Division at the end of the 1995–96 season; they were 12 points short of the safety mark set by York City. Brighton continued to decline under Steve Gritt, and only avoided losing their Football League status on the last day of the 1996–97 season with a dramatic final day draw with Hereford United. Minton finished as the club's top scorer in 1997–98 with seven goals in 39 appearances, as Albion again finished second-from-bottom, though this time were 15 points clear of last place Doncaster Rovers. New manager Brian Horton had a brief spell in charge, before the club finished 1998–99 in 17th place under Micky Adams; Minton scored nine goals in 38 games, and was voted onto the PFA Team of the Year. In total Minton made 199 league and cup appearances, scoring 32 goals, in five seasons, during a poor time in the club's history which saw them forced to sell the Goldstone Ground and temporarily reside at Gillingham's Priestfield Stadium.

He joined Port Vale on a free transfer in June 1999, in a move that reunited him with Brian Horton. He scored four goals in 26 games in 1999–2000, as the "Valiants" were relegated out of the First Division. Following a 2–1 defeat to non-league Canvey Island at Vale Park in the FA Cup, he and four other players were placed on the transfer list in December 2000; this was despite him scoring twice in the original 4–4 draw at Park Lane. He scored four goals in 29 games in 2000–01. He struggled to hold down a place in the first team in the New Year and entered talks with Rotherham United in March 2001. He was signed to provide cover for the suspended Stewart Talbot. Minton scored twice on his debut for the "Millers" in a 3–0 win over Bristol City at Millmoor. He made eight further appearances in the remainder of the 2000–01 season as Ronnie Moore's side secured promotion to the First Division with a second-place finish, just two points behind champions Millwall.

Minton joined Third Division side Leyton Orient in July 2001. He made 39 league and cup appearances in the 2001–02 season and was part of the team that beat First Division Portsmouth in the third round of the FA Cup in January 2002. He was offered a two-year extension to his contract in January 2002 by manager Paul Brush, but left the club in August 2002 and joined Isthmian League club Grays Athletic. Two weeks later, he moved to Jeff King's Canvey Island in a player exchange deal for midfielder Adam Miller.

He scored nine goals in 41 starts in 2002–03, and was voted as Supporters Player of the Year, as Canvey finished second in the Isthmian League. He scored five goals in 38 starts in 2003–04, as the "Gulls" won the Isthmian League title and promotion into the Conference National. He also featured in the final of the FA Trophy in 2004, where they were beaten 3–2 by Hednesford Town. He scored once in 20 games in 2004–05, as Canvey finished 18th. He scored six goals in 40 games in 2005–06, however Canvey chose to be demoted into the Isthmian League despite a mid-table finish.

Minton joined Chelmsford City in August 2006, and went on to score seven goals in 43 appearances in 2006–07. He then helped the "Clarets" to the Isthmian League championship in 2007–08. They reached the Conference South play-offs following a fifth-place finish in 2008–09, but lost out to Hampton & Richmond Borough. Minton was released in June 2009, and joined Welling United the following month. He was subsequently made team captain, however after three appearances he was released after just a month.

After taking a break from the game, he signed for Isthmian League club Ware in November 2012.

According to the Rotherham United website, Minton was a "dynamic midfielder" and "was a player with a good passing ability with a liking to push forward".

Steve Davis (footballer, born 1965)

Steven Peter Davis (born 26 July 1965) is an English former professional footballer who played as a defender. After managing Cheshire-based non-league teams Northwich Victoria and Nantwich Town, he was manager of Crewe Alexandra (from November 2011 to January 2017, at which date he was the fourth longest serving manager in the top four divisions of English football) and then head coach at National League club Leyton Orient for just over four months up to 14 November 2017.

Born in Birmingham, Davis started his career with Stoke City as an apprentice in 1982 but never made a senior appearance. However, he played more than 140 matches for both Crewe Alexandra and Burnley, making his Crewe debut at the age of 18, and captaining the team aged 19. He was also a key figure in the time he was at Burnley. He then played over 100 matches for Barnsley in Division 1, including 24 appearances in the season in which they were promoted to the Premier League. He had loan spells at York City and Oxford United, eventually being signed by Division 1 outfit, Oxford United in 1998.

The final years of his playing career saw him in Cheshire with Macclesfield Town, and with Northwich Victoria and Nantwich Town – where he was player-manager of both clubs.

Davis was capped by the England national youth team.

He was appointed as player-manager of Northwich Victoria in June 2003. He resigned in September 2003, after the team were second bottom of the Conference National in the 2003–04 season.

However, his managerial career at Nantwich Town was the most successful time in the club's long history, converting a club that had never achieved anything above the North West Counties League to one that was challenging for a Conference spot. He led Nantwich to two promotions in three seasons and a FA Vase victory, just missing out on promotion to the Conference North at the end of the 2008–09 season. His abilities attracted the attention of Crewe Alexandra, where he had spent four seasons as a player. On 17 May 2009, it was announced that he would become assistant manager to Gudjon Thordarson at Crewe.

Davis remained as Thordarson's assistant through the Icelandics short lived tenure at Gresty Road before the former Stoke City manager was relieved of his role in October 2009. Taking up the vacant manager's role was Dario Gradi, now in his third stint as Crewe manager kept Davis as his assistant manager. Gradi remained in the managerial position at the club until the autumn of 2011 his position was starting to become questioned by the Crewe fans, this was only galvanised further by a 3–0 home defeat to Torquay United which left the club near the relegation zone. Although Gradi was still manager of the club, Davis took charge of the next match against Oldham Athletic in the Football League Trophy after the Crewe manager could not attend after feeling unwell. Although Crewe lost the match 3–1, Davis was appointed the new Crewe manager a couple of days later with Gradi moving to his former role as Technical Director - a role he took following the appointment of Steve Holland as first team coach back in the summer of 2007.

Promoting coach Neil Baker as his assistant manager, Davis' first match, officially, as Crewe manager was a home FA Cup tie to Colchester United. Although the railwaymen lost the tie 4–1, Davis' brief for the remainder season was specific: keep Crewe in the football league. Davis was successful in his target keeping Crewe in the football league and, in a run that saw the club go 16 matches unbeaten, the English manager helped Crewe qualify for the League Two play-offs. Following a 3–2 win over two legs with Southend United and a 2–0 win over Cheltenham Town at Wembley, Davis' team were promoted to League One.

Davis had lost two key figures in that season's promotion campaign in the summer with Nick Powell completing a three million pound transfer to Manchester United and captain Ashley Westwood for an undisclosed fee to Aston Villa but they were replaced by a number of summer signings such as forward Mathias Pogba, defender Mark Ellis and midfielder Abdul Osman. Davis successfully secured safety in League One in his first season and also guided his team to a second Wembley appearance this time in the final of the Football League Trophy against Southend. The Railwaymen won the tie 2–0 with goals from Luke Murphy and Max Clayton.

As with the previous summer, Davis lost a key member of his midfield this time in the form of Luke Murphy who left the club for Championship club Leeds United in 2013 for a million pounds. Despite a brief period linking him with the vacant Wolves managerial position, Davis remained at the Alex. The 2013–14 season was less successful than Davis' previous seasons, compacted even more after seven first team players were held by Devon and Cornwall Police for an alleged sexual assault during the team's pre-season training in Redruth. The players were cleared of all charges in November, a few months into the new campaign. Davis described the decision as a "noose being removed from our necks" citing the case as one of the reasons for the team's poor start to the campaign. Further to the sex assault allegations, Davis was also having attitude issues with summer signing Anthony Grant and former Newcastle youngster Brad Inman - listing the pair on loan and isolating them from the rest of the squad in training labelling the pair as a "disruption." The pair were later reinstated to the squad and first team duties following an improvement in their attitudes and helped Crewe avoid relegation on the last day of the season with a 2–1 victory over local rivals Preston North End.

The 2014–15 season was no better in terms of Crewe's performance. The team lost 10 of their first 12 matches, and eventually finished in 20th position - remaining in League One despite losing the final match of the season, against Bradford City, because of results in fixtures elsewhere.

The following season started in a similar pattern, with the team winning just two of their first 15 league matches, and crashing out of the FA Cup in the first round, defeated at Gresty Road by non-league Eastleigh, forcing Davis to defend his position as the 'right man' for the job. Crewe's relegation to League Two was confirmed following a 3–0 defeat at Port Vale on 9 April 2016, with five matches remaining.

Davis was sacked as Crewe Alexandra manager on 8 January 2017.

On 10 July 2017, Davis was appointed as head coach of newly relegated National League club Leyton Orient on a two-year contract. After the club won just five of their 19 league matches, he was sacked on 14 November 2017.

In September 2018, Davis was reported to be in the running to be appointed manager of Cheltenham Town.

His son, Harry, was at Crewe Alexandra but now plays for St Mirren, and is also a centre-back. He made his professional debut at the end of the 2009–10 season, playing for Crewe against Bradford City.

Another son, Joe, is a defender at Port Vale, having made his professional debut at the club during his first spell in April 2011. On 22 February 2014, for 33 minutes of a match at Port Vale, Davis's sons played on opposite teams against each other.
