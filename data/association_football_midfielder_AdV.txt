Richie Towell

Richard Patrick Towell (born 17 July 1991) is an Irish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for club Salford City.

Towell started his career with Scottish club Celtic and made his debut in the first half of the 2010–11 season. He then had two loan spells with Hibernian before leaving Celtic in 2012.

Towell has represented the Republic of Ireland under-21, under-19 and under-17 teams

Towell started his career at Crumlin United and in 2007 moved to Celtic. In November 2010, he made his professional debut coming on as a substitute for Jos Hooiveld in the 57th minute of Celtic's 2–2 draw against Inverness, he provided an assist for Paddy McCourt.

On 25 January 2011, he joined Hibernian on loan until the end of the 2010–11 season. Towell made his debut a day later, in a 2–0 loss to Rangers. He was at fault for the concession of the second Rangers goal, as a misplaced pass allowed Nikica Jelavić a clear chance to score. Despite this bad start, Towell helped to solidify the Hibs defence during the latter part of the 2010–11 season. Hibs manager Colin Calderwood stated in April 2011 that he hoped to sign Towell for a longer period. Towell said in April 2011 that he received abuse from Hearts supporters in Edinburgh derby matches because he was Catholic. However, he also said that this made him more determined to play better. Towell returned to Celtic at the end of the season, having made 15 starting appearances for Hibs.

Towell re-signed on loan for Hibs on 25 August 2011, on a deal due to run until June 2012. He played the first match of his second loan spell only 3 days later, starting as Hibs lost 2–0 to Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts. Towell started to find first-team opportunities limited after new manager Pat Fenlon made several signings in the January transfer window. Two right backs and two central midfielders came in with one other right back going out. However, Fenlon said that once Towell had got his fitness levels up he would be back in the first team picture.

Towell was signed by Stephen Kenny for Dundalk in December 2012, ahead of the 2013 Airtricity Premier Division season.

Towell made his League of Ireland debut against Shamrock Rovers on the opening night of the 2013 season and was hugely influential in Dundalk's second-placed finish that year, scoring seven times in 31 league appearances. He also picked up the PFAI Young Player of the Year award. He won back to back league titles with Dundalk in 2014 and 2015 scoring 11 and 25 goals in the respective seasons, and got his first taste of Champions League football with the League of Ireland champions.

Towell signed for Brighton & Hove Albion on 30 November 2015. Towell made his debut for the Sussex club in the third round of the 2015-16 FA Cup on 9 January 2016 away against Hull City where The Seagulls lost 1-0 to a Robert Snodgrass penalty. 
Despite not playing a single league game in the 2015-16 Football League Championship season Towell made an appearance in the 2016 Championship play-offs as a substitute away against Sheffield Wednesday where Brighton were beaten 2-0 and 3-1 on aggregate. Towell scored his first goal for The Albion in a 3-1 FA Cup loss away to then National League side Lincoln on 28 January 2017. Towell's only league game to date with The Seagulls came against his then future loan club Rotherham United on 7 March 2017 where he came on as a substitute where Brighton won 2–0 at the New York Stadium. At the end of the season Brighton & Hove Albion were promoted to the Premier League.
In May 2017, following Brighton's promotion to the Premier League, Towell signed a deal to keep him at the club until 2019.

On 31 August 2017, he signed for League One's Rotherham on a season-long loan where he helped them regain their Championship status, winning the 2018 EFL League One play-offs. On 31 August 2018 he returned to Rotherham United for a second season-long loan spell. He made 34 Championship appearances scoring 4 times as Rotherham were relegated back to League One.

On 31 May 2019 Towell joined Salford City on a two-year contract.

In May 2008, Towell made his Republic of Ireland under-17's debut in a European championship match against Switzerland. He gained his second Ireland under-17 cap four days later, against Spain.

Towell made two appearances for Republic of Ireland under-21s in the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification campaign.

Nguyễn Trọng Hoàng

Nguyễn Trọng Hoàng (born 14 April 1989) is a Vietnamese footballer who is currently playing midfielder for Viettel of the V-League (Vietnam) and Vietnam national football team. He is widely considered by the Vietnamese press as one of the most promising talents of his generation.

After the departure of Le Cong Vinh to Hà Nội T&T F.C. in 2009, Hoang was given Vinh's number 9 and since then, he has become an important part of Sông Lam Nghệ An.
His performance helped SLNA win third place in the 2009 V-League season and 2010 Vietnamese Cup title. In the financial turmoil that affected most V-League clubs after the 2012 season, SLNA was unable to arrange a financial contract with Nguyen. The contract between Nguyen and SLNA expired on 2 January 2012.

In 2007, Hoang was in Alfred Riedl's plan for the 2007 Southeast Asian Games. However, he was left out because he had to take the final exam for his high school studies.

In 2009, Hoang was again chosen to play in the 2009 Southeast Asian Games by Henrique Calisto. Hoang scored in the third game of the tournament against Malaysia. However, he was injured when he played against Cambodia, which prevented him from playing in the semi-final. In the tournament's final, Hoang came on as the substitute but the team lost against Malaysia in the final and received the silver medal. Despite the loss, the team's performance in the tournament was impressive enough that Hoang is one of the few players who were called up to play in the national team.

In 2010, he was again chosen to play in the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, in which he scored two goals against Turkmenistan and Bahrain to help Vietnam proceed into the second round for the first time in history. The team lost to North Korea, but he was then selected to play in the 2010 AFF Suzuki Cup. In the first game, Hoang scored two goals against Myanmar after he came on at the 72–minute. The team came on to win 7–1.

Pizzi (Portuguese footballer)

Luís Miguel Afonso Fernandes (born 6 October 1989), known as Pizzi (), is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for Benfica and the Portugal national team as a central midfielder.

After a successful loan at Paços de Ferreira, he spent three years in Spain with as many teams, totalling 74 games and 12 goals in La Liga. He has played over 250 games for Benfica, winning ten domestic honours including four Primeira Liga titles, three of which consecutively.

Pizzi made his senior international debut for Portugal in 2012 and was part of their squad at the 2017 Confederations Cup and 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, winning the latter tournament.

Born in Bragança, Pizzi began his career with hometown club G.D. Braganca in the third tier in 2007. A year later, he joined Primeira Liga club S.C. Braga, spending most of his time out on loan and making his first professional appearances with S.C. Covilhã of the Segunda Liga in 2009. On 10 January 2010, he joined top-flight club F.C. Paços de Ferreira.

In 2010–11, Pizzi scored seven league goals for Paços, only missing three league matches. On 8 May 2011 he netted a hat-trick in a 3–3 draw at Porto, which turned out to be the only home league game that the eventual champions failed to win during the season. He scored twice on 3 March in a 4–3 win at C.D. Nacional to qualify the team for the 2011 Taça da Liga Final.

On 30 August 2011 Pizzi moved to Spanish team Atlético Madrid, on loan until the end of the year, after which the "Colchoneros" had an option to buy the player permanently for €13.5 million, which they did in October of the following year. He made his La Liga debut on 18 September 2011, replacing also newly signed Radamel Falcao midway through the second half of a 4–0 home win against Racing de Santander. He scored his only Atlético goal to open a 3–2 win over Levante UD also at the Vicente Calderón Stadium on 20 November, totalling 15 appearances of which three were in the victorious UEFA Europa League campaign.

Along with several compatriots, initially still under contract with Braga, Pizzi moved to Deportivo de La Coruña for the 2012–13 campaign. In only his second appearance, through a penalty kick, he helped the Galicians come back from 1–3 at Valencia CF for a final 3–3 draw, scoring his team's last goal; he added a brace against FC Barcelona on 20 October 2012 – one of the goals coming through a superbly-taken free kick – but his team lost 4–5 at the Riazor Stadium.

On 26 July 2013 Pizzi signed a six-year contract with S.L. Benfica, for a fee of €6 million for half of his economic rights, being immediately loaned to RCD Espanyol also in Spain's top flight.

In the 2014–15 season, Pizzi joined Portuguese champions Benfica and was converted from winger to central midfielder, like his predecessor Enzo Pérez. On 5 October 2014, Pizzi debuted in a 4–0 win against Arouca in Primeira Liga. On 14 January 2015, Pizzi scored his first goal for Benfica, from a penalty kick, in another 4–0 home win against Arouca, this time in the third round of league cup. On 28 February, Pizzi scored his first goal for Benfica in the league, in the thrashing of Estoril (6–0).

Pizzi scored 12 times in 48 games over the 2016–17 season as Benfica won a domestic double. He was voted Player of the Month consecutively from October/November to December, and eventually Player of the Season at the LPFP Awards.

On 1 December 2017, during the Porto vs Benfica match, Pizzi was attacked in the back by a supporter of Porto who invaded the pitch; Porto faced a maximum of two behind closed doors matches but was only fined €2,860.

On 10 August 2018, Pizzi scored a first-half hat-trick in a 3–2 home win over Vitória de Guimarães in the opening (league) match of the 2018–19 season, and was again voted Player of the Month for August 2018. He scored 15 goals and made 23 assists in 55 matches overall that season as Benfica regained the league title, and at its conclusion he signed a new contract until 2023.

Pizzi scored twice in the 2019 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira on 4 August, a 5–0 win over city rivals Sporting CP at the Estádio Algarve. By scoring twice on 14 December in a 4–0 win over F.C. Famalicão he had recorded 16 goals for the season, 11 of which in the league, making it already his highest-scoring season.

Pizzi made his debut for Portugal on 14 November 2012 in a friendly with Gabon, scoring through a penalty in an eventual 2–2 draw in Libreville.

He was selected for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia, playing two matches as the Portuguese finished third.

Merkel received his first call-ups for the senior team during the 2009–10 campaign, but he was never fielded nor named on the bench. At the beginning of the following season, he took part in some pre-season games, putting up good performances. Merkel eventually made his first-team official debut on 8 December 2010, coming off the bench in a UEFA Champions League group stage game against Ajax, He also came off the bench against Tottenham on the 75th Minute for Kevin-Prince Boateng on 6 January 2011, he also made his league debut, figuring in the starting line-up for a match against Cagliari.

Merkel made his official debut for the club in 4–3 win over Nocerina in third preliminary round of the Coppa Italia, on 20 August 2011.

In another December 2010 interview he said that he is interested in representing Russia. Russian Football Union president Sergey Fursenko and Russia's coach Dick Advocaat both commented saying that he can't be called up as he does not actually possess Russian citizenship. Merkel noted that naturalization should not be a problem, considering that an American-born Jon Robert Holden played for the Russia national basketball team.

In February 2011, Merkel's adviser Arthur Beck, father of German international Andreas Beck, confirmed the player's renewed wishes to be capped for Germany.

Yacouba Sylla (born 29 November 1990) is a professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for CFR Cluj and the Mali national football team, having represented France as a youth international.

Prior to joining Clermont Foot where Sylla signed his first professional contract he had a year's stint with Ligue 1 club Stade Malherbe Caen. Before that, Sylla had started his career with hometown Parisian club Étampes FC before joining nearby club CSF Brétigny, which produced France internationals Patrice Evra and Jimmy Briand. After four years in Brétigny, Sylla spent the next four years roaming around clubs in the Lower Normandy region such as AS Montferrand, SC Malesherbes, and Caen. And then in 2009, he signed an amateur contract with Clermont where he was inserted into Clermont's reserve team for the 2009–10 season. He appeared in 17 matches scoring one goal.

For the 2010–11 season, Sylla was promoted to the senior team by manager Michel Der Zakarian. He made his professional debut on 15 October 2010 in a league match against Le Mans playing the entire match in a 2–0 defeat.

With 221 matches and 88 goals Dézio Esteves belongs to the outstanding players in the history of Bangu with which he achieved 1951 the second place of the State Championship of Rio under the stewardship of the Uruguayan champion coach Ondino Viera. With coach Tim Bangu reached a third place in this competition in 1959. In the year after he won alongside Zózimo and Ademir da Guia the 1960 edition of the International Soccer League in New York, a tournament with the participation of the then English champions Burnley FC and a number of other reputable European sides. This win has since become part of the clubs folklore and is often happily interpreted as a club world championship.

Released by Bilbao in the summer of 1997, Guerrero signed with Racing de Santander of La Liga, starting in most of the matches during the campaign and making his debut in the competition on 26 October in a 0–2 away loss against FC Barcelona, as the Cantabrians eventually retained their division status.

Marcos Vales Illanes (born 5 April 1975) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a midfielder.

Born in A Coruña, Vales made his professional debut with local Deportivo de La Coruña. As "Super Depor" came to fruition, he was sparingly used during his two-year spell with the Galicians, leaving at the age of 19. Only linked to the club with an amateur contract, he moved to Asturias and signed with Sporting de Gijón, with Deportivo president Augusto César Lendoiro proceeding to engage in a lengthy court battle, which was eventually resolved in the footballer's favour.

After three seasons with Sporting, only starting in the latter as the team finished 15th in La Liga, Vales signed with fellow league side Real Zaragoza for 200 million "pesetas". He started regularly in his first years, but was already a fringe player in the 2000–01 campaign when the Aragonese won the Copa del Rey.

In the summer of 2002, following Zaragoza's relegation, Vales moved to Sevilla FC also of the top flight. In his first season he was first-choice, notably scoring the game's only goal in a local derby against Real Betis on 2 March 2003.

Vales missed the vast majority of 2003–04, due to a foot injury. He then signed with RCD Mallorca, but suffered a relapse in his condition and eventually decided to retire at age 30, with Spanish top flight totals of 228 matches and 18 goals; subsequently, he worked in a law firm in his hometown.

On 14 October 1998, Vales earned his first – and only – cap for Spain: it consisted of one minute in a 2–1 win in Israel for the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifiers, after coming on as a substitute for Real Madrid's Raúl.

Previously, he helped the under-21 side win the 1998 European Championship in Romania.

After another average season he gradually fell out of favour with Tenerife and, in the 1999 January transfer window, returned to Las Palmas in the first of a series of loans. Robaina spent one season in Portugal with Sporting Clube de Portugal, taking no part whatsoever in the Lisbon side's national championship conquest (three games, ten minutes). In the following year he played with another team in his native region, Universidad de Las Palmas CF, suffering relegation from Segunda División and being subsequently released by his main club, for which he appeared in nearly 150 competitive games.

Nuno Mendes (footballer)

Nuno Alexandre Pereira Mendes (born 7 April 1978) is a retired Portuguese footballer who could play in defence and midfield.

He began his career with Vitória Guimarães and made his first team debut during the 1996–97 Primeira Liga season. Mendes spent three seasons in Liga de Honra, playing for Aves, Felgueiras and Chaves respectively before moving to France to join Division 1 club Strasbourg in 2000. He returned to Portugal a year later to play for União Leiria, managed by José Mourinho, before spending a brief period with Braga in 2002. Mendes spent 18 months with Moreirense and then dropped down a division to play for Santa Clara in 2004.

A year later, Mendes played in England for Championship club Plymouth Argyle before returning to France with Créteil of Ligue 2. Having spent a brief spell with Penafiel in 2007, he returned to Aves, where he played for two seasons in Liga de Honra. He dropped down to the Portuguese third division in 2009 to play for Moreirense before spending a season with Trofense. Mendes retired in 2011 after a year with third division side Gondomar. He represented Portugal at under-21 level.

Mendes was born in Guimarães. He joined his home town club, Vitória Guimarães, at an early age and progressed through their youth system. He made his first team debut in a 4–1 win against Chaves on 23 February 1997. He made 5 more appearances that season, including a 1–0 defeat to Marítimo on 2 May 1997, which was his last for Vitória. Mendes joined Liga de Honra side Aves on loan for the 1997–98 season.<ref name="Moreirense/loan moves">"Nuno Mendes confirmado" (in Portuguese). "Record". 18 January 2003. Retrieved 5 February 2011.</ref> He scored four goals in 27 league appearances for the club as they finished 15th in the table. The following season, he joined Felgueiras on loan. They finished 5th in Liga de Honra and Mendes was a first team regular. He made 28 league appearances and scored two goals. Mendes had his contract with Vitória Guimarães terminated in June 1999, allowing him to sign a two-year deal with Chaves.

He made 27 league appearances in his only season with the club, scoring twice, as they finished 12th in Liga de Honra. He moved to France in June 2000 to play for Division 1 club Strasbourg. Having signed a four-year contract, he made his debut in a 1–1 draw at Lille on 29 November 2000. He found first team opportunities limited during the 2000–01 season, making six more league appearances as the club were relegated to Division 2. However, the season did end well for Mendes as he won his first trophy as a professional, the Coupe de France. He made two appearances in the competition, but did not play in the final where Strasbourg defeated Amiens on penalties.

Mendes returned to Portugal ahead of the 2001–02 season, joining Primeira Liga club União Leiria on a season-long loan. Reflecting on his time in France, he said "I never hid my desire to return to Portugal, but now I can not say anything more." He made his debut on 11 August 2001 in a 0–0 draw at Braga. Mendes played regularly under the management of José Mourinho prior to his departure to Porto, but fell out of favour under his replacement, Vítor Pontes. He made 16 league appearances for Leiria, helping the club finish 7th in the Primeira Liga, before returning to Strasbourg. Upon his departure, Mendes was critical of the club's president João Bartolomeu, who he believed created instability at the club. "The Union of Leiria is a complicated club at senior management level, especially the president, who sees things where they do not exist and it creates instability in the squad," said Mendes who "leaves great friends in Leiria".

In May 2002, he signed a two-year contract with Braga. He made his debut in a 3–2 defeat at Belenenses on 5 October 2002. In a season disrupted by injuries, Mendes only played in one more match for Braga, against his old club Vitória Guimarães. He had his contract cancelled in January 2003, which allowed him to join Moreirense. He made his debut on 3 February 2003 in a 1–1 draw at Benfica. He made two more appearances that season as the club finished 12th in the table. Having fractured his foot in July 2003, he was used sparingly during the 2003–04 season by manager Manuel Machado. He made four league appearances in an injury-plagued season, as the club finished 9th in the Primeira Liga. Mendes dropped down a division in June 2004 after signing a one-year contract with Santa Clara. "This project is attractive," he said. "The coach, Jose Morais, spoke to me and showed willingness in me to go to the Azores and that's important. I know that Santa Clara is going through some difficulties, but the Department intends to make a financial recovery in time and maybe next season bet on rising."

He made his debut on 29 August 2004 in a 3–1 defeat against Feirense and was sent off for two bookable offences. The club finished 15th in Liga de Honra in the 2004–05 season, with Mendes making 17 league appearances. He scored his first goal for the club in his final game, a 4–0 win against Naval on 22 May 2005. After his contract with Santa Clara expired, he joined English Championship club Plymouth Argyle on their pre-season tour of Sweden in July 2005. Having appeared in friendlies against Betsele and Umeå, he signed a permanent contract with the club. "I am delighted to have got him," said manager Bobby Williamson of his new signing. "It's a great opportunity that I could not miss," Mendes said in an interview with Portuguese newspaper "Record". "It is valid for two seasons, with a few perks that are unheard of in Portugal. Essentially, the level of premiums for targets, as is normal in English football."

Mendes made his debut in a 1–0 defeat at Crystal Palace on 20 August 2005. He made two more appearances, including one in a 2–1 League Cup win against Peterborough United, before losing his place in the squad when Bobby Williamson was replaced by Tony Pulis as manager. He had a trial with Major League Soccer club New York Metrostars in January 2006 before his contract with Plymouth Argyle was cancelled by mutual consent. In June 2006, he returned to France where he signed a two-year contract with Créteil of Ligue 2. He made his debut on 28 July 2006 in a 0–0 draw with Guingamp. Mendes made six more appearances for the club, before being released from his contract in December 2006. A month later, he returned to Portugal where he signed a short-term contract with Liga de Honra club Penafiel. He made his debut in a 1–0 defeat at Rio Ave on 4 February 2007, and made 5 more appearances during the 2006–07 season as Penafiel finished 8th in the table. Having reached the end of his contract with the club, Mendes returned to Aves ahead of the new season.

He made his league debut on 18 August 2007 in a 2–1 defeat at home to Olhanense. Mendes scored his first goal in his second stint for Aves on 17 February 2008 in a 1–1 draw with Trofense, and he scored again one week later in a 2–1 defeat at Varzim. He finished the 2007–08 season with 23 league appearances and two goals, helping the club finish 8th in the Liga de Honra table. He made four more league appearances the following season, before being released from his contract in January 2009 due to a lack of first team opportunities.<ref name="Aves/Moreirense">"Nuno Mendes de regresso ao Moreirense" (in Portuguese). "O Comércio de Guimarães". 17 January 2009. Retrieved 7 February 2011.</ref> Mendes dropped down to the third division of Portuguese football later that month, for the first time in his career, to return to Moreirense. He made his debut on 25 January 2009 in a 1–0 win at Chaves, and scored his first goal a week later in a 2–2 draw with Tirsense. Mendes scored two goals in a 3–0 win against Ribeirão on 8 February 2009 and was sent off later in the game. He scored four goals in 12 appearances for the club, but Moreirense were unable to gain promotion back to Liga de Honra, finishing 2nd, three points behind Chaves.

In August 2009, Mendes joined Liga de Honra club Trofense on a one-year contract. He made his league debut on 19 September 2009 in a 3–0 defeat at Feirense. He made eight more league appearances, before being released from his contract in January 2010. He then returned to the Segunda Divisão with Gondomar and he made his debut on 31 January 2010 in a 2–0 win against Vieira. His first goal for the club came one week later in a 4–4 draw with Espinho. Mendes scored his second goal in a 2–1 win against Padroense. He made 12 league appearances in the 2009–10 season, scoring twice, as they finished 4th in the table. Having lost his place in the team during the 2010–11 season – making one league appearance – Mendes left Gondomar at the end of the campaign and subsequently retired from playing.

Mendes represented the Portuguese national team at every youth level, from under-16 to under-21. He earned four caps at under-21 level.

Filip Twardzik

Filip Twardzik (born 10 February 1993) is a Czech footballer who plays as a midfielder for Slovak club Ružomberok in the Fortuna Liga.

Twardzik and twin brother Patrik started off their careers with Sachsen Leipzig before being signed by Hertha Berlin. On 1 February 2009, they were both signed by Celtic, a week before their 16th birthday. Filip and Patrik both suspended their education when they moved to Celtic. Their mother also moved to Scotland to help them adjust to their new life.

Twardzik made his first-team debut for Celtic on 8 January 2012, coming on as a 70th minutes substitute in a Scottish Cup win against Peterhead. He made his second appearance in the next round of the Scottish Cup against Inverness. Coming on as a late substitute in the 93rd minute. His league debut came on 7 April in a 6–0 against victory Kilmarnock, he came on shortly after the start of the second half and assisted the fifth goal with a clever back-heel.

On 2 February 2015, Twardzik re-joined his former Celtic manager Neil Lennon at Championship side Bolton Wanderers. He signed a two-year contract at the Macron Stadium and went on to score on his debut in a 4–1 defeat for Wanderers at Derby County.

After one season with Ostrava-based club MFK Vítkovice (2nd division), he joined Ružomberok. He cited co-operation with his former coach David Holoubek as one of the reasons for the shift to Ružomberok. He also said that a 'career restart' is another reason for his spell in Ružomberok, where he had been on a pre-season trial two years earlier. 

Although in Vítkovice he played as a defensive midfielder, in Ružomberok Holoubek utilised him as a center back again. He debuted in Fortuna liga on the first matchday (21 July 2018) against iClinic Sereď. The game concluded as a goal-less tie. In the season he made 19 league appearance (plus 3 in Slovnaft Cup), always in the starting XI. He scored a single goal, on 2 December 2018, in a 3–1 win over struggling reigning champions, Spartak Trnava, from a penalty after a foul on fellow Czech Erik Daniel. 

In early March, however, Twardzik suffered an unspecified injury and did not participate in the remaining 12 games of the season, particularly the championship group, during which Ružomberok reclaimed and kept the third position, guaranteeing a spot in next season's Europa League first qualifying round. 

After the departure of Holoubek and his assistant Jiří Jarošík from Ružomberok, it was unclear whether Twardzik would remain in the club.

Twardzik played three times in the 2010 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. He played 14 times in total for Czech Republic U17s scoring five goals. He made his competitive debut for Czech Republic U19s on 21 May 2011, in a 1–0 victory over the Netherlands.

Twardzik was born in the Czech Republic but raised and educated in Germany as his father played football there.

His twin brother Patrik, a forward, also played for Celtic. His older brother, Dan, plays for Motherwell FC as a goalkeeper. His father, René, was also a goalkeeper and played for Sachsen Leipzig.

Álvaro Benito Villar (born 10 December 1976) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a left midfielder, and is the vocalist/guitarist of Rock band Pignoise.

Born in Salamanca, Castile and León, Benito emerged through Real Madrid's youth ranks, making his senior debut not yet aged 18 with the C-team. He progressed to the reserves the following year.

In the 1995–96 season, Benito was relatively used by the main squad, and contributed with seven matches the following campaign as they were crowned La Liga champions. In November 1996, he suffered a severe knee injury from which he would never fully recover, undergoing three operations in only four months in 1998 in Pittsburgh, United States; he was involved in a car accident afterwards, which further curtailed his recovering process.

After one unassuming loan with CD Tenerife and another spell with Castilla, Benito was released by Real Madrid in summer 2002, joining city neighbours Getafe CF in Segunda División, He appeared rarely for his new club, again due to injury.

After retiring, Benito was in charge of several of Real's youth sides, starting with the "Alevín B" in 2015. He was dismissed in late February 2019, following criticism of the first team after a 0–3 home defeat against FC Barcelona in the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey on a radio show.

Benito won his first – and only – cap for the Spain under-21 side on 12 November 1996, coming on as a late substitute for FC Barcelona's Roger García in a 1–1 home draw against Slovakia for the 1998 UEFA European Championship qualifiers, but being stretchered off shortly after with a serious injury that all but ended his career.

During his rehabilitation period, Benito started playing guitar and writing songs, going on to put together a band, Pignoise. The group, which also featured another former footballer, Héctor Polo (Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano), eventually used many of the songs he composed prior to its creation.

Ness began his career with Rangers and made his debut for the first team in January 2011. He then scored against Celtic in the Scottish Cup but his progress was hampered by injuries. In 2012, he became a free agent and joined Stoke City. He failed to make an impression with Stoke and spent time out on loan with Leyton Orient and Crewe Alexandra. Ness joined Scunthorpe United in July 2015 on a free transfer. He spent two years with the "Iron" before joining Plymouth Argyle in June 2017. In 2019 he signed for Scottish Championship side Dundee.

Ness made his first Rangers appearance in a pre-season friendly against Portsmouth and was predicted to have a bright future.

On 2 January 2011, Ness made his full debut in an Old Firm derby which Rangers lost 2–0. On 6 February 2011, he scored his first Rangers goal with a strike in the third minute of a fifth round Scottish Cup match, at home to Celtic.

PFA Scotland had previously commented that players were entitled to become free agents if they objected to the transfer. Ness had raised a constructive dismissal claim against Rangers.

Ness signed a four-year contract with Premier League side Stoke City on 3 July 2012. It took a while until he was granted international clearance by FIFA due to contract dispute with Rangers but he made his first appearance in a Stoke shirt in a pre-season match against Columbus Crew on 24 July 2012.

Ness joined Plymouth Argyle in June 2017. He was released by Plymouth Argyle at the end of the 2018–19 season.

Ness signed a two-year contract for Dundee in June 2019, with the option for a further year.

Nicolás Martínez (footballer, born 1987)

Nicolás Martinez (born 25 September 1987 in Viedma), known simply as Nico, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Greek club Aris. 

His brother is the footballer Juan Manuel Martínez.

Martinez was formed in the youth system of Vélez Sarfield, in 2008 he was loaned to Almirante Brown a team in third category of Argentina. In 2009, he joined Independiente but he did not make his first team debut until the year 2010. On 19 December 2010, Martínez scored in 4–2 victory over Defensor Sporting in the Copa Sudamericana 2010, helping Independiente advance to the quarter finals. In 2011, he left Independiente and signed with Santiago Wanderers of Chile.

In Santiago Wanderers is overshadowed by Tressor Moreno who held the same post in the field. The departure of the Colombian player gave him the chance to play a vital role for the club in Apertura 2012. When the year ends Santiago Wanderers did not take advantage of the purchase option and Martinez returned to Independiente.

On August 1, 2012 is signed to Real Murcia. It started well gaining his role in the starting XI. In his second day in the club at Estadio El Molinon against Sporting Gijon scored a wonderful goal putting his name in the scoreboard. This match was eventually won by Real Murcia, but gradually the club lost the title. Eventually during the season lost his place and remained on the bench. He concluded his contract with the club on July 2013. On August 8, 2013 he signed for a year contract with San Martín de San Juan.

On January 17, 2014 he signed a contract with Panetolikos and will play at Greek Super League till the summer of 2015. On September 2014, Martinez expands his contract with the club till the summer of 2016.

The 27-year-old Argentine playmaker has been in excellent form since the start of the 2014/15 season and AEK are chasing his signature. AEK will consider to make a bid after the end of the season and the possibility of completing this transfer is highly likely as the two clubs share an amicable relationship. Branco Milovanovic, AEK's technical director, is in contact with Martinez's agent and it is likely that an offer to land Panetolikos attacking midfielder is on the cards. On the other hand, the Argentian midfielder is linked with the Greek champion Olympiakos.According to Goal newspaper Panetolikos have accepted a bid in the region of €600,000, as Olympiakos manager Vitor Pereira is a big admirer of Martinez.

On 2 July 2015, Martinez signed a 4 years' contract with Greek champions Olympiakos for over €600,000.

A month after he signed a year contract for Cypriot First Division club Anorthosis Famagusta on loan from Olympiakos. Negotiations between the two clubs had finalized with media reports suggesting that the player will spend the season on loan at the club and that Anorthosis Famagusta FC will foot €200,000 of his €350,000 per year salary. According to club sources, a player of Martinez's quality was what was missing last season when Anorthosis Famagusta just about missed out on Europe after finish fifth at the end of the 2014–15 season. He finished the year as the udisputable leader of the club, but they still finish fifth.

On 31 August 2016, in the last day of the summer transfer window, Western Sydney Wanderers have reportedly come to terms with 28-year-old Argentinian attacking midfielder and signed him on a long season loan from Greek Super League club Olympiakos. As part of the loan deal with Western Sydney sources say that out of his current wages of $563,000 a season, the Wanderers have agreed to pay about $266,000 while Olympiakos will foot the remainder. Tony Popovic the coach of the club has placed his faith after signing on loan from Olympiakos. "“When I came here the other players had been training for two months – I had quickly to get used to the players and the intensity. Here they work very hard, it’s not like in South America where sometimes if you are not fit you can still play football. Here it is very physical”" Martinez said after his first training with the new club. On 6 November 2016, he scored the fastest goal in Wanderers Hyundai A-League history to put the visitors in front inside the first minute, in a 2–2 away draw against Perth Glory.

On 31 August 2017, he signed a year contract for Cypriot First Division club Apollon Limassol on a long season loan from Olympiakos.
On 18 September 2017, he scored his first goal with the club in a 4–2 home win game against Ermis Aradippou.

On 27 August 2018, newly promoted Aris has taken out-of-favour Argentinian midfielder Martinez as a free transfer from Olympiacos by signing a year contract for an undisclosed fee. Martinez is surplus to the requirements of the club, and travels to Thessaloniki to strength Aris’ deepening roster. His first goal came in a disappointing 4–1 away loss against Olympiacos, on 10 March 2019.

Pelé (footballer, born 1991)

Judilson Mamadu Tuncará Gomes (born 29 September 1991), known as Pelé, is a professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for English club Reading, on loan from AS Monaco FC, and the Guinea-Bissau national team.

Born in Agualva-Cacém to Bissau-Guinean parents, Pelé started his career with local C.F. Os Belenenses. He made his first-team – and Primeira Liga – debut on 11 January 2009, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–0 away win against Rio Ave FC.

Much more used in his first full season (seven starts, 642 minutes of action), Pelé's team would nonetheless suffer relegation, ranking second from bottom.

On 4 January 2011, after having been linked to the club in September 2010, Pelé was signed by Serie A side Genoa CFC, with the deal being made effective in the summer. However, he only appeared for the under-20 reserves during his spell.

On 30 August 2011, Pelé was exchanged with A.C. Milan's Mario Sampirisi, both in a co-ownership deal. He played as an overage player (only four players born in 1991 were allowed that season) for the B-team in his first year.

On 31 July 2012, Pelé was loaned out to FC Arsenal Kyiv in the Ukrainian Premier League. He spent the following campaign in the same situation, with S.C. Olhanense back in his homeland.

After a successful loan spell at Belenenses, where he scored seven competitive goals to help his team finish in sixth position and qualify for the UEFA Europa League, Pelé attracted the interest of S.L. Benfica, who signed him for 2015–16. He was immediately loaned to F.C. Paços de Ferreira, and on 31 January 2017, still owned by the former, joined C.D. Feirense also in the Portuguese top flight.

On 29 June 2017, Pelé signed a five-year contract with Rio Ave. He scored seven league goals in 38 official matches in his first and only season, helping to qualification for the Europa League second qualifying round after a sixth-place finish.

Pelé moved to the French Ligue 1 in July 2018, agreeing to a five-year deal at AS Monaco FC – Benfica and Rio Ave shared the €10 million transfer fee in equal parts. He made his debut in the competition on 28 September, starting in a 0–2 away loss to AS Saint-Étienne and being replaced by Benjamin Henrichs late into the second half.

On 31 January 2019, Pelé joined English club Nottingham Forest on loan for the remainder of the season. On 6 August, in the same situation, he moved to Reading also of the Championship.

Pelé played twice for Portugal in the 2010 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualification, in both games as a substitute, but was not selected for either the final tournament or the elite qualifying phase. He was then picked for a warm-up friendly before the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup, a 3–3 draw to France, and appeared in all the matches in the finals in Colombia as the nation finished in second position.

Pelé made his debut for Guinea-Bissau on 10 June 2017, starting in a 1–0 win over Namibia for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.

Valeri Qazaishvili

Valeri "Vako" Qazaishvili (born 29 January 1993) is a professional footballer who plays for the San Jose Earthquakes and the Georgia national team as an attacking midfielder.

He debuted for Georgia's national team on 5 March 2014 in a friendly match against Liechtenstein.

Starting his footballing career in his native country, Georgia. Qazaishvili made several appearances for Metalurgi Rustavi and Sioni whilst on loan from Saburtalo Tbilisi before joining Dutch side Vitesse in 2011. After impressing with the Vitesse youth sides, Qazaishvili was given his debut on 27 November 2011, in a 0–0 draw with Twente, starting the fixture before being replaced by Georgian teammate Giorgi Chanturia in the 65th minute. A week later, Qazaishvili scored his first Vitesse goal in a 4–0 victory over RKC Waalwijk, netting in the 21st minute to make it 2–0. In the later years of Qazaishvili's spell with Vitesse, he became a key figure, especially in their 2014–15 and 2015–16 campaigns, netting nineteen times between the two.

On 31 August 2016, Qazaishvili joined Polish side Legia Warsaw on a season-long loan. On 14 September 2016, Qazaishvili made his Legia Warsaw debut in a 6–0 home defeat against Borussia Dortmund in the opening matchday of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League. On 1 October 2016, Qazaishvili made his league debut for Legia Warsaw in a 3–0 victory over Lechia Gdańsk, replacing Guilherme in the 76th minute. On 14 May 2017, Qazaishvili scored his first and only goal for Legia Warsaw in their 6–0 home victory over Nieciecza, coming off the bench to seal the win, netting in the 88th minute.

Following the conclusion of the 2016–17 campaign, Qazaishvili returned to Vitesse after appearing sixteen times and scoring once (in all competitions) for Legia Warsaw. After leaving Legia, he stated that he was disappointed with the loan and with Legia coach Jacek Magiera, who Qazaishvili said told him from the very beginning of the loan that he did not have a place with the team. However, he was pleased to have the opportunity to play in the Champions League and alongside players like Nemanja Nikolić, who he would later compete against in MLS.

On 22 June 2017, Qazaishvili joined American side San Jose Earthquakes as a Designated Player, the team's youngest ever, after a six-year spell with Vitesse. He was introduced at the club on 10 July 2017, by General Manager Jesse Fioranelli during halftime of San Jose's U.S. Open Cup quarterfinal victory over the LA Galaxy; Georgian basketball player Zaza Pachulia, who was playing for the Golden State Warriors at the time, was present at the ceremony as well. His club debut came in a friendly match four days later on 14 July as a 63rd minute substitution in San Jose's 4–1 defeat of Eintracht Frankfurt. Qazaishvili scored in his MLS debut on 19 July, coming on as a halftime substitution for Danny Hoesen against the New York Red Bulls at Red Bull Arena and scoring San Jose's lone goal of the 5–1 defeat in the 88th minute off of a cross by Jahmir Hyka. He first started for the Earthquakes on 9 August during the team's U.S. Open Cup semifinal loss against Sporting Kansas City, earning an assist on Hoesen's goal and converting his penalty when the game was settled with a penalty shootout. During his first MLS start, at home against the Philadelphia Union on 19 August, Qazaishvili scored his second league goal, assisted by Tommy Thompson.

Qazaishvili has represented Georgia at under-17, under-19 and under-21 levels before making his senior debut in 2014 in 2–0 victory over Liechtenstein, in which he replaced Avtandil Ebralidze at half-time.

Qazaishvili became a regular with the senior squad, and was a part of Georgia's unsuccessful 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification run in 2017. He scored in Georgia's 2–2 draw with Moldova on 11 June, keeping qualification hopes alive, and again in Georgia's 1–1 tie with Ireland on 2 September. He played in the remaining qualifying matches as well, against Austria, Wales, and Serbia, but Georgia ultimately failed to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Qazaishvili was born in Ozurgeti, but grew up in the Vake-Saburtalo District of Tbilisi, the Georgian capital. His mother is a Georgian teacher, and his father is a factory engineer; he has a younger brother, Beka, who is eighteen months younger than him. In 2011, Qazaishvili married his wife Gvantsa, whom he met growing up in Saburtalo, and their daughter Emilia was born in 2015. He received his U.S. green card in January 2019, which qualifies him as a domestic player for MLS roster purposes.

Qazaishvili is close friends with Georgia national teammate Guram Kashia, whom he met playing for Vitesse and who joined him in San Jose in 2018. He said of his move to the Netherlands as a teenager that his friendships with Kashia and fellow Georgian teammate at Vitesse Giorgi Chanturia, whom he knew and had played football with from his childhood, helped what was otherwise a difficult move to a new country at a young age.

Qazaishvili is a fan of and influenced by Argentine footballer Lionel Messi and Italian footballer Alessandro del Piero.

Jason Lowe

Jason John Lowe (born 2 September 1991) is an English professional footballer who plays for club Bolton Wanderers. He has played much of his career as a midfielder, but he has also been used as a right back.

Lowe has spent most his career at Blackburn Rovers, making his debut in 2011, and cementing his place in the first team in the same year. He continued in the first team until his departure in 2017. He spent the 2017–18 season with Birmingham City before joining Bolton.

Lowe made his international debut for the England under-20 team in 2011, captained his country at the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup, and made his under-21 debut that same year.

Lowe was born in Wigan, Greater Manchester and raised in nearby Leigh. He attended St. Thomas C.E. Primary School in Leigh.

Lowe joined Blackburn Rovers' Academy as an under-12 and had progressed to the Reserves when he signed his first professional contract on 4 September 2009. On 8 January 2011, he made his senior debut in the 1–0 win over Queens Park Rangers in the first round of the FA Cup. A week later, he made his first appearance in the Premier League, as a 24th-minute substitute for the injured David Dunn in a 2–0 loss to Chelsea. Lowe was set to join Aberdeen on loan before the deal fell through due to injuries in the Blackburn first team.

On 24 March, he joined Oldham Athletic of League One on loan until the end of the season, to gain experience of competitive first-team football. Lowe made his Oldham debut against Tranmere Rovers four days later, and scored his first goal for the club with a penalty in the 2–0 win against Notts County on 3 April. On 25 April 2011, he "fired into the top corner late on" to help Oldham secure a 1–1 draw with Walsall on 25 April, and he finished his loan spell with two goals from seven appearances.

Lowe's next appearance for Blackburn came in the League Cup second-round win against Sheffield Wednesday on 24 August 2011. He made his first league appearance of the season, as a substitute for Rubén Rochina against Fulham on 11 September, and his first league start for Blackburn six days later against Arsenal. After producing what BBC Sport dubbed "a string of impressive displays", Lowe signed a five-year contract with Blackburn. He continued to be a first team regular, playing in a variety of positions; according to manager Steve Kean, "he can play right-back, holding midfield player, wide right, doubling up with a full-back, he can play box-to-box as a genuine midfield player". He was twice suspended in the 2011–12 season, but still made 37 appearances in all competitions as Blackburn Rovers were relegated from the Premier League.

At the start of the 2012–13 season, manager Steve Kean spoke of Lowe as one of several players in contention for a place in defence. He started the opening Championship match, away to Ipswich Town, at left back, and scored a late own goal to give the hosts a draw. The following week, he set up the opening goal for Nuno Gomes in a 2–1 win over Leicester City. He started regularly in midfield in October 2012 under caretaker manager Eric Black, but a hamstring injury then kept him out for a month. Against a background of continued managerial changes, Lowe established himself in Blackburn's midfield, and finished the season with 42 appearances in all competitions.

In the 2013–14 season, Lowe continued as a regular in midfield, and in October he signed a contract extension to run until 2017. Manager Gary Bowyer said that if Lowe wanted to make himself into "that old-fashioned midfielder that can do a bit of everything", he needed to start scoring goals. Four days later, he obliged, with a "thunderous 25-yard strike into the top corner" at home to Middlesbrough that earned him the club's Goal of the Season award. Speaking afterwards, he said "I don't think the phrase Jason Lowe and match-winner go together very often, so that's something that's nice to change. As soon as I hit it I knew it had a chance and when I saw it was on target and it flew in it was an unbelievable feeling. After Lowe's third consecutive man-of-the-match performance, teammate and former England international David Dunn discussed his potential in glowing terms. He made his 100th appearance for the club on 3 December, in a 3–1 loss against Ipswich Town, and went on to make 42 appearances in all competitions over the season.

Ahead of the 2014–15 season, Lowe said he was targeting more goals, but Rovers' shortage of defenders through injury meant he reverted to the right-back position, and then injury intervened. A stress fracture in his foot kept him out for several months, and a week after his return to the side, he suffered a recurrence of the injury during a 2–0 win over Charlton Athletic on 20 December. He came back into the team apparently fully fit a month later, producing what Bowyer dubbed a terrific performance against Wigan Athletic on 17 January 2015, but the injury recurred yet again in mid-February and Lowe underwent surgery that kept him out for the rest of the season. Four appearances into the 2015–16 season his foot let him down yet again and he had another operation. Having spent six months on the sidelines, Lowe returned to action with the reserve side to regain his match fitness. He returned to the first team on 9 April in the starting eleven for a goalless draw away to Wolverhampton Wanderers, and started four of the remaining five matches.

After Grant Hanley left the club, Lowe was appointed captain for the 2016–17 season. The team struggled, and he himself had disciplinary issues: he received his tenth yellow cardhis fifth in six appearanceson 17 December, so by the end of the year had missed three matches through suspension. As the season progressed, Rovers' form dipped and they settled in the relegation zone. In the penultimate match of the season, against Aston Villa, Lowe supplied the cross for Danny Graham's winning goal; the result left survival in their own hands. On the final day, Rovers won 3–1 at Brentford, but other results went against them and they were relegated to League One. Lowe was one of eight players released. In a farewell message, he thanked staff and supporters who had helped him "grow as a man and a player" over 13 years with the club, and said that Blackburn Rovers would always have a special place in his heart.

Lowe signed a one-year contract with Championship club Birmingham City on 31 August 2017. He was one of six debutants in the starting eleven for Birmingham's next fixture, away to Norwich City; he played 78 minutes and was yellow-carded in the first half as his team lost 1–0. After just two minutes of his home debut a week later, Lowe injured a hamstringthe fifth such injury sustained by Birmingham players in the first few weeks of the season.

He was released by Birmingham at the end of the 2017–18 season.

After his release from Birmingham, Lowe became Championship club Bolton Wanderers' first signing of the 2018 summer transfer window when he signed a two-year deal on 8 June. He made his debut for Bolton on 4 August when starting Wanderers' 2–1 victory over West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns. Lowe began the 2019-2020 season as captain. This lasted until 17 September, when Liam Bridcutt became captain. Lowe became captain again after Bridcutt left.

Lowe was called into a training camp for England U19 after impressing for Blackburn in the Academy and reserves and was on stand-by for the U-19 which travelled to Ukraine for the UEFA European Under-19 Championship Elite Qualifying Round. Lowe was selected for England U-19 for the UEFA European Under-19 Championship Finals in July 2010, but eventually missed out due to injury.

Lowe made his debut for England U-20 in a friendly against France on 9 February 2011. In July 2011, Lowe was included for the England U–20 squad at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Colombia, joining his teammate Josh Morris. Prior to the FIFA U-20 World Cup, Lowe made his only cap before he captained England U-20 at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Colombia in the summer of 2011, where they were knocked out in the last 16.

After playing for England U20, Lowe was called up by England U21 and appeared as an unused substitute against Iceland national under-21 football team on 7 October 2011. On 10 October 2011, Lowe made his debut for England U21 in a 2–1 win against Norway U21 in a Euro 2013 qualifier.

Lowe made his two more appearance for England U21 later in November 2011 against Iceland U21 and Belgium U21.

Lowe continued to be recalled by England U21 for the Euro qualifier on several occasions and became a first team regular in England's U21 squad until June 2013

In May 2013, Lowe was called up again for the UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Israel. Lowe played two matches, as England U21 were eliminated in the Group stage. This turns out to be his last appearance for the England U21 squad.

During his six-year spell at Blackburn Rovers, Lowe was named the club's first Player Ambassador by Blackburn Rovers Community Trust.

Rafinha netted a brace at Real Sociedad on 23 November 2013, but it amounted to nothing as the hosts won 4–3 with four goals from Carlos Vela. He was voted the league's Breakthrough Player of the Season, ahead of Real Madrid's Jesé and Rayo Vallecano's Saúl Ñíguez.
Rafinha made his league debut for Barcelona on 24 August 2014 in Luis Enrique's first match in charge, playing the first half of an eventual 3–0 win over Elche at the Camp Nou before being replaced by Marc Bartra. On 25 November, he assisted Lionel Messi's goal in a 4–0 group stage triumph at APOEL, which made him the outright top scorer in the history of the UEFA Champions League; however, he was also sent off for two bookings later on in the match.

Rafinha scored his first goal for the "Blaugrana" on 3 December 2014, concluding a 4–0 away win against Huesca in the first leg of the Spanish Cup's last 32 (12–1 aggregate). The following 1 February, he recorded his first goal for the team in the domestic league, part of a 3–2 home triumph over Villarreal. They went on to win the treble, with the player being an unused substitute in the domestic and European finals.

With compatriot Neymar out through illness, Rafinha started on the left of Barcelona's attack in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla in Tbilisi, scoring the third goal in a 5–4 win. On 16 September he suffered a torn right anterior cruciate ligament during the 1–1 away draw to Roma for the Champions League group phase, leaving the game on a stretcher after being on the receiving end of a heavy challenge from Radja Nainggolan; after surgery, he was expected to be out for about six months.

Rafinha scored six times in only 18 appearances in the 2016–17 campaign, but also had to undergo surgery to an internal meniscus ailment following a match against Granada in April 2017, going on to be sidelined until the end of the year.

On 22 January 2018, Inter Milan announced the acquisition of Rafinha on a loan with an option to buy for €35 million. He made his debut for the club six days later by entering in the last moments of the 1–1 draw against SPAL. He scored his first goal on 6 May, in the 4–0 away defeat of Udinese.

On 24 November 2018, Rafinha broke the anterior cruciate ligament of his left knee during a 1–1 draw at Atlético Madrid, being again sidelined for several months. On 2 September 2019, immediately after extending his contract until 2021, he rejoined Celta on a season-long loan.

Rafinha played for Spain at youth level, earning 14 caps for three different teams. On 29 February 2012, he scored for the under-19s in the first minute of their 2–1 friendly win over France in Meaux.

Later that year, however, Rafinha switched allegiance to Brazil, going on to represent the under-20 side at the 2013 South American Youth Championship in Argentina. He was one of seven stand-by players named by Dunga for the senior team at the 2015 Copa América.

In September 2015, Rafinha was called up by Dunga for friendlies against Costa Rica and the United States. On 5 September, he entered the former game at New Jersey's Red Bull Arena in the 81st minute in place of Luiz Gustavo. Four days later, a minute after taking the field against the latter, he scored his first goal, then assisted clubmate Neymar in a 4–1 win.

Rafinha's father, Mazinho, was also a footballer and a midfielder, notably winning the 1994 FIFA World Cup with Brazil. His mother Valéria played volleyball, while his elder brother, Thiago – another midfielder – also emerged through Barcelona's youth ranks, going on to represent its first team and the Spain national side.

Rodrigo, who played youth football with Real Madrid and went on to spend several seasons with S.L. Benfica, was a lifelong friend who was erroneously referred to as Rafinha's cousin.

He made 30 league appearances in nearly two years at the club although he spent summer of 1996 having an unsuccessful trial with Stade Lavallois.

Isco

Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez (; born 21 April 1992), commonly known as Isco (), is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Real Madrid and the Spanish national team. In 2017, he was selected as one of the 30 best players in the world for that season.

He began his career at Valencia, playing mainly in its reserve team, before joining Málaga in 2011. His performances at Malaga earned him the Golden Boy award in 2012, and a €30 million move to Real Madrid in June 2013, with whom he won four UEFA Champions League titles.

Isco represented Spain at various youth levels, including at the 2012 Olympics, and made his senior international debut in 2013, later taking part at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Isco was born in Benalmádena, Málaga, Andalusia. As a child he played for Atlético Benamiel, where his teammates included Charlie I'Anson. A product of Valencia CF's youth system, he spent the 2009–10 season with the club's reserve team in Segunda División B, netting once in 26 games and suffering relegation.

While still registered with the reserves, Isco made his debut with the first team on 11 November 2010, against UD Logroñés for the campaign's Copa del Rey, scoring two goals in a 4–1 home win (Paco Alcácer made his senior bow in the same fixture). He played his first La Liga match three days later, featuring for 20 minutes in a 2–0 home win against Getafe CF after coming on as a substitute for Aritz Aduriz; he thereafter made three further league appearances and two in the UEFA Champions League, all from the bench, and helped the B-team return to the third level by scoring 15 goals in their campaign.

In mid-July 2011, Isco signed a five-year contract with Málaga CF after the club activated his buy-out clause of €6 million. He scored his first goal for his new team on 21 November 2011, starting in a 3–1 away win against Racing de Santander; he netted again the following week in a 2–1 win against Villarreal CF, and finished his first season with 32 games and five goals as the side qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in its history.

On 18 September 2012, in Málaga's first game in the Champions League group stage, Isco netted twice in a 3–0 home win over FC Zenit Saint Petersburg, also being chosen as Man of the Match. On 22 December he scored the first goal in an eventual 3–2 win against Real Madrid at La Rosaleda, leading the locals to their first victory over that opponent in 29 years; in December he won the Golden Boy award, beating Stephan El Shaarawy and Thibaut Courtois.

On 28 January 2013, Isco ended speculation regarding his future by signing a new contract with Málaga – his new buyout clause was set at €35 million. He scored his eleventh goal of the campaign on 13 March, netting the opener in a 2–0 home win against FC Porto, good enough for last-eight qualification after the 0–1 loss in Portugal.

On 17 June 2013, Isco confirmed that he had received offers from Real Madrid and former Málaga manager Manuel Pellegrini's Manchester City, but stated he would only make a final decision on his future after the UEFA European Under-21 Championship final. On 26 June, Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez confirmed that a deal had been reached with the player and that he would be presented by the club next week, once he passed his medical; the following day he signed a five-year contract, with Real Madrid paying €30 million for his services, thus becoming the first signing of newly appointed manager Carlo Ancelotti.

On 18 August 2013 Isco made his official debut for the "Merengues", recording an assist and scoring the winning goal in a 2–1 home win over Real Betis, the latter coming through an 85th-minute header. He continued with his form by netting two goals against Athletic Bilbao on 1 September (3–1, also at the Santiago Bernabéu).

In spite of continuing to score regularly when featured, Isco received limited opportunities in the first team due to the 4–3–3 formation not being suited for his style, but Ancelotti stated that it was "a temporary problem". He scored 11 goals in 53 official games in his first season, including 61 minutes in the Champions League final, a 4–1 win over Atlético Madrid.

Isco started the first game of the 2014–15 season against Real Sociedad, and scored the first in a 4–1 win against UD Almería on 12 December 2014. He was a regular starter in the club's FIFA Club World Cup winning campaign, scoring the last in a 4–0 semi-final routing of Cruz Azul. His performances over the season earned him many plaudits, and he was compared to Zinedine Zidane by the French legend himself.

Prior to the start of the 2015–16 season, Isco switched his shirt number from 23 to 22, which he had previously worn at Málaga. On 21 November 2015, as Real lost 0–4 at home to FC Barcelona in "El Clásico", he was sent off in the 84th minute for a foul on Neymar. He scored twice on 2 December, as the team won 3–1 at Cádiz CF in the first leg of the last 32 of the domestic cup. Isco was a part-time starter when the team won the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League.

On 11 February 2017, Isco scored Real Madrid's 100th goal of the season as he attained the game-winning goal in a 3–1 away victory against Osasuna.

He appeared 30 times during the 2016–17 season, as Real Madrid won La Liga title; he also started in the Champions League final against Juventus, which Madrid won 4–1.

On 8 August 2017, Isco scored a goal in the 2017 UEFA Super Cup, contributing to Real Madrid's 2–1 victory against Manchester United. His performance earned him the man of the match award.

On 14 September 2017, he signed a new deal with Real Madrid until June 2022. During the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, he made eleven appearances, when Madrid won their third consecutive and 13th overall Champions League title.

Isco appeared with Spain's U17 in 2009 FIFA World Cup, scoring three times in the process as the nation finished third. In 2011 he represented his country – together with Málaga teammate Recio – in the U-20 World Cup held in Colombia, netting one goal in an eventual quarter-final exit.

On 28 February 2012 Isco was called to the Spanish under-23s for a friendly against Egypt, but did not leave the bench. On 15 May he was picked for the first time to the senior team for friendlies with Serbia and South Korea, but took no part in either match. In July, he went with the under-23 team to the Olympics in London, starting all of Spain's matches as they were eliminated without scoring a goal.

On 6 February 2013 Isco made his debut with the main squad, playing the last 30 minutes in a 3–1 win over Uruguay in Doha, Qatar. Also that year he appeared at the UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Israel, he scored in the final and finished the competition with the "Bronze Boot" (3 Goals) and made the team of the tournament as a key player for the eventual winners.

Isco scored his first international goal for Spain in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against Belarus in Huelva on 15 November 2014, opening a 3–0 win.

Isco scored his first hat-trick for Spain on 27 March 2018, netting three goals against Argentina in a 6–1 friendly win.

In May 2018, he was named in Spain’s final squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Isco began his career as an attacking midfielder or as a second striker: at Málaga, under Manuel Pellegrini, he often played in an attacking role in the team's 4–2–3–1 formation. Following his move to Real Madrid, manager Carlo Ancelotti also played him in a deeper midfield playmaking role requiring more sacrifice and defensive duties than his natural position. He has also been deployed as a winger on occasion.

A quick, skilful and creative player, with excellent technique and ball control, Isco is known for his natural ability to pick out an inch-perfect pass, dribble effortlessly through two or three challenges or drift a shot into the top corner of the goal. His one-step-ahead reading of the game, his anticipation of space and the general directing of his side's performances are his most common traits.

In 2013, Isco was credited by "Marca" journalist Pablo Polo as being "the most promising young player in Spanish football", comparing his strength, skill, and low centre of gravity to Sergio Agüero, and his vision and passing abilities to Zinedine Zidane. Former Real Madrid captain Iker Casillas predicted in 2015 that Isco would become Spain's most important player.
