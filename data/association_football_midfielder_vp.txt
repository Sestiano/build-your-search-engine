Ryan Fenech

Ryan Fenech (born 20 April 1986 in Ħamrun, Malta) is a professional footballer currently playing for Birkirkara where he plays as a midfielder.

Ryan Fenech joined Ħamrun Spartans as a trainee, and made his debut for the club during the 2002–03 season, although Ħamrun Spartans found themselves in the relegation group, Fenech helped his side to a seventh place finish, during the season Ryan made six appearances and scored one goal.

Ryan started to establish himself in the first team, but unfortunately Ħamrun Spartans finished the season in 10th, bottom position in the Maltese Premier League for the 2003–04 season. During the season Ryan made ten appearances.

Fenech and Ħamrun Spartans heartache was short lived as the club gained an immediate return to the Maltese Premier League, as the club finished as champions in the Maltese First Division for the 2004–05 season.
The 2005–06 season saw Ryan and Ħamrun Spartans return to the Maltese Premier League, and the hope that they could retain their Premier League status, however it was to be another disappointing season for Ryan Fenech, as Ħamrun Spartans finished in 10th position and were again relegated to the First Division, during the season Fenech made 20 appearances and scored two goals.

Ryan and Ħamrun Spartans started and finished the 2006–07 season with a replica of what they did during the 2004–05 season, with another championship win, and an immediate return to the Premier League.

Fenech was hopeful that he could this time keep Ħamrun Spartans in the Premier League during the 2007–08 season, following a hard season, Ħamrun Spartans defied the odds and finished in sixth position. Ryan's performances were so impressive that he was called up to the Malta national football team, during the season Ryan made 24 appearances and scored two goals.

For the 2008–09 season, Fenech and Ħamrun Spartans hoped to improve on their previous season, but the club did anything but, and following an extremely poor season Ħamrun Spartans were yet again relegated to the First Division. with another 10th place finish, during the season, Ryan made 22 appearances and scored one goal.

With the player in high demand, linked with Marsaxlokk, Valletta and Sliema Wanderers, and forcing his way into the Maltese national team, Fenech was seeking a short term move away from Ħamrun Spartans, with the player thinking if he stayed with Ħamrun Spartans and played in the First Division it may harm his international chances.

During the summer of 2009, Ryan Fenech completed a season long loan deal to move from Ħamrun Spartans to Sliema Wanderers.

Fenech made his Premier League debut for Sliema Wanderers on 30 August 2009 in a 1–0 defeat to Qormi.

Ryan scored his first Premier League goal for Sliema Wanderers on 7 February 2010, as he scored after 11 minutes to help Sliema Wanderers to a 3–0 victory over Floriana.

Fenech joined Valletta for the 2010–11 season of the Premier League. At his first season with Valletta, Fenech won the Premier League, going unbeaten all season. Fenech played a vital part in Valletta's UEFA Champions League qualifiers, where Valletta reached the second round after beating Tre Fiori 5–1 on aggregate. They then faced FK Ekranas, where they lost 2–4 on aggregate.

On 25 November 2010, it was announced that Howells had signed a new two-year contract with Luton. With an injury to regular left-back Fred Murray in December 2010, Howells reverted to his original position in defence, helping Luton keep six clean sheets during the month of January. After another solid season in a number of positions, including central midfield, Howells again received the Young Player of the Season award and, in doing so, became the second Luton player, after Kevin Foley to win the accolade for three consecutive seasons.

The 2011–12 season saw Howells used primarily at left-back due to injuries to other players; he played in that position in the team that lost 2–1 to York City in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium in May 2012. The next month saw him sign a new three-year contract and, with the departure of Keith Keane to Preston North End, Howells became the team's current longest serving player at the age of 21, having made 183 appearances by the end of the season. Moved back into midfield by new Luton manager Paul Buckle in the 2012–13 season, Howells scored his first goal of the campaign within the first 45 seconds of a 4–1 win at home to Macclesfield Town on 1 September 2012.

Another managerial change saw Buckle replaced by the experienced John Still in February 2013. Howells scored the first goal under Still's reign in a 1–0 win away to Stockport County on 2 March 2013. As under previous managers, Howells continued to be played in a variety of roles, including on the left side of attack and in the hole behind two strikers. During the 2013–14 season, at the age of 22, Howells made his 250th appearance for Luton on 2 November 2013 in a 0–0 draw with Gateshead. He became the club's regular penalty-taker, successfully converting six out of six penalties. Howells finished the season with eight league goals in 35 appearances as the club won the Conference Premier title and therefore promotion into League Two.

In July 2014, Howells signed a new two-year contract with Luton. On 17 January 2015, Howells made his 300th appearance for the club at the age of 23 in a 1–0 win over Plymouth Argyle. He finished 2014–15 with 41 appearances and five goals as Luton finished in eighth place on their return to the Football League. In the summer of 2015, Howells asked to leave the club. On 15 July 2015, Luton manager John Still confirmed that he had turned down an offer for Howells' services from an unnamed club. He was not given a squad number by the club when they were announced five days later.

On 11 September 2015, Howells joined Luton's fellow League Two club Yeovil Town on a one-month loan. He finished his loan spell with seven appearances and returned to Luton on 12 October. Howells was left out of the first-team squad by Still upon his return, but was recalled to the starting lineup by interim manager Andy Awford following Still's sacking in December 2015 and was assigned squad number 40. He made his first Luton appearance of 2015–16 in a 3–2 win away to Exeter City on 19 December. Howells admitted he had no complaints over his treatment by Still, stating that "maybe it was the wrong step" to ask to leave the club in the summer. Following the appointment of Nathan Jones as Luton manager, Howells' run in the first-team continued, playing in every match under Jones' management until picking up a knee injury, for which he underwent a scan. Shortly after, it was confirmed Howells would require a knee operation, resulting in a spell on the sidelines. He returned to first-team football as a 94th-minute substitute for Josh McQuoid in a 3–2 win away to Oxford United on 16 April 2016. Howells finished the season with 17 appearances, but his contract with Luton was not renewed after 334 appearances and 31 goals since making his first-team debut at the age of 17 in 2008.

On 23 May 2016, Howells signed for National League club Eastleigh on a two-year contract. He made his debut on the opening day of the 2016–17 season in a 2–1 win at home to Guiseley. His first goal for Eastleigh was the team's third goal in a 5–0 win away to Bromley on 29 August. Howells made his final appearance for Eastleigh in a 1–1 draw at home to Swindon Town in the FA Cup on 4 November, in which he suffered a knee injury. He left Eastleigh by mutual consent on 4 January 2017 when manager Martin Allen began reshaping the squad.

On 20 January 2017, Howells signed a one-and-a-half-year contract with National League club Dagenham & Redbridge. He debuted on 11 February as an 83rd-minute substitute in a 4–1 win away to Southport. After three appearances for Dagenham, Howells signed for National League South club Ebbsfleet United on a one-month loan on 16 March 2017, as the club had sustained a number of injuries. He debuted at left-back five days later in an 8–0 victory at home to Bishop's Stortford. Howells completed the loan spell without making any further appearances. He was released by Dagenham at the end of the 2017–18 season after not being offered a new contract.

Howells signed for newly promoted National League South club Billericay Town on 28 June 2018.

Howells returned to fellow National League South club Hemel Hempstead Town on 29 May 2019.

Howells is eligible to play for England by birth, and also qualifies for Wales through one of his grandfathers. Wales enquired about picking Howells for their under-21 team towards the end of the 2008–09 season, but on 30 October 2009 he was named in the England C squad for the match against the Poland U23 team. He earned his first cap in a 2–1 victory. Howells scored his first goal for England C in a 1–0 victory over Estonia in the International Challenge Trophy on 12 October 2010.

On 27 July 2011, Howells was called up to the Wales U21 squad to face Hungary in a friendly match. He said "I'm really proud to be called up and hope to do well when I play." He made his debut as Wales U21 lost 2–1 on 10 August. He made four further appearances during the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification campaign, playing in victories over Montenegro and Andorra, and defeats to the Czech Republic and Armenia as Wales U21 failed to qualify.

Eyong Enoh

Eyong Tarkang Enoh (born 23 March 1986) is a Cameroonian football midfielder who played in the Cypriot First Division for Olympiakos Nicosia and for the Cameroon national team.

Raised in the Southwest Region of Cameroon, the son of a local government official, Enoh's football career began in the youth ranks of local club Little Foot FC from Tiko, where he played for five seasons. He was spotted by Mount Cameroon while playing for Little Foot in the 2001 Mini-Interpools and recruited to the Buea team that same 2001.. After five seasons playing for Little Foot FC, Enoh transferred to Mount Cameroon FC, a club from Buéa, for the 2003–2004 season, playing in the Cameroon Premiere Division, the top flight of football in his homeland. While at Little Foot he had been given the nickname Verón, after the Argentinean midfielder Juan Sebastián Verón, due to their similar playing style. He continued to bear the nickname in his new club and in the University of Buea where he had enrolled in the Faculty. It was during his period in Buéa, that he began playing for the Cameroon national football team's Cadet Lions, receiving his first caps for the national youth teams of Cameroon.

Following his debut at the top flight in Cameroon, Enoh transferred to Mağusa Türk Gücü S.K., a club from the Occupied area from Turkey. He appeared in 36 matches and scored one goal for his new club, playing in the Kuzey Kıbrıs Süper Ligi. After just one season with the club however he transferred once more, this time to Türk Ocağı Limasol, remaining in Northern Cyprus. The transfer did not fare well with Enoh as he did not receive any playing time, and after six months terminated his contract with his new club.

Having returned to Cameroon after his less successful stint in Northern Cyprus, Enoh was signed to South African Ajax Cape Town in the summer of 2006, playing in the South African Premier Soccer League for the Cape club. In his first season in Cape Town, Enoh made a mere nine appearances during the regular season. A year he would also help Ajax Cape Town to win the ABSA Cup. While leaving a lasting impression after his first season, Enoh became a valuable player to Ajax CT the following season, when he was made team captain and was awarded the Ajax Cape Town Player of the Year award at the end of the 2007–2008 season.

In the summer of 2008, Enoh travelled to Europe for many trials in France, Denmark, Sweden and England but was not offered a contract. He was on the brink of signing with Maccabi Haifa from Israel but the two parties could not come to terms. Harry Redknapp made an attempt to sign the young midfielder to Portsmouth but Enoh could not get a work clearance on time to play in the U.K.
In August 2008 he signed a contract at AFC Ajax Amsterdam until 30 June 2010 with a two-year option. Enoh was the first Cameroonian that ever played for Ajax. After making a stunning Eredivisie debut against Feyenoord on 21 September 2008, he quickly became a regular starter in Marco van Basten's team. He scored his first UEFA Cup goal against Olympique Marseille on 18 March 2009 in the Amsterdam ArenA and has become a popular figure with the fans for his workman-like performances. He was a regular starter under new manager Martin Jol. Enoh along with many other Ajax regulars spent a good portion of the 2011–12 season injured. He returned to the Ajax first team in an important 2–0 win against PSV Eindhoven, in which he scored. When Frank de Boer was appointed manager, Enoh had fewer starting opportunities, and was used more as a substitute player.

Enoh signed for Premier League side Fulham on loan until the end of the season on 31 January 2013, with Fulham having the option to sign the player on a permanent deal. At Fulham, Enoh was rejoined with his former Ajax manager Martin Jol. He made his début for Fulham when he came on as a substitute in their 1–0 win over Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 17 March 2013.

Following his loan spell at Fulham where he made 9 regular season appearances for the Cottagers, Enoh returned to Ajax on 11 July 2013 where he was given the number 26 shirt. Having lost his starting position at Ajax, and with Fulham opting not to purchase the defensive midfielder at the end of their season, Enoh was granted permission by Ajax to negotiate with other clubs, and weigh out alternative options, since his contract runs until mid-2015. Kasımpaşa and Olympiacos had been mentioned as clubs interested in signing the midfielder. Unable to secure a transfer however Enoh remained in Amsterdam. Playing time for the first team was bleak due to emerging talent coming from Sportpark De Toekomst, such as Thulani Serero and Lucas Andersen, and newly arrived Lerin Duarte. While registered by manager Frank de Boer to play in the clubs 2013–14 UEFA Champions League campaign if necessary, Enoh was given minutes in the Dutch Eerste Divisie for the reserves team Jong Ajax in the meantime, where he made his debut on 15 September 2013 against Willem II in a 1–1 draw at home.

Having come to terms with Antalyaspor from Turkey, Enoh left Ajax having appeared in 98 league matches, having scored 3 goals. He played in 13 matches for the KNVB Cup, and made 36 appearances on the continental stage for Ajax, scoring one goal, He also competed in the Johan Cruijff Shield once.

On 11 January 2014, it was announced that Enoh had signed with the Turkish club from Antalya. Ajax received a transfer fee of €600.000,- while Enoh will serve the remainder of the 2013–14 season on a 6-month loan spell from the Dutch club, before entering a two-year contract with the option for an additional year with Antalyaspor. He made his debut in the Turkish Cup match against Galatasaray which ended in a 1–1 draw at home. He made his regular season debut in the 3-1 win over Kayseri Erciyesspor.

On 30 August 2014, only months after completing his transfer to Antalyaspor, it was announced that Enoh would transfer to Belgian Pro League side Standard Liège, signing a two-year contract. The transfer fee paid out to the Turkish club is unknown On 5 October 2014, Enoh made his debut for his new club in a match against Club Brugge. He was sent off, receiving a red card following a hard tackle on Ruud Vormer only 10 minutes into the match, which ended in a 3–0 loss.

On 31 January 2018, it was announced that Willem II had signed Enoh on a 6-month contract as a free transfer. Joining the club from Tilburg on the final day of the Winter transfer window, he was issued the number 32 shirt, returning to the Eredivisie where he had previously played for Ajax.

The following Summer Enoh returned to Cyprus, this time relocating to the Greek side of the island, signing with newly promoted Enosis Neon Paralimni FC, competing in the Cypriot First Division, the top flight of football in Cyprus.

On 13 June 2019 he joined newly promoted Olympiakos Nicosia in the Cypriot First Division for 6 months.

Enoh made his debut for Cameroon on 7 June 2009 against Morocco during their 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign. The match in Yaoundé ended in a 0–0 draw, with Enoh playing the full 90' minutes. He played in several more World Cup qualifiers and was called up for the 2010 African Cup of Nations in Angola as well. Drawn into Group D of the tournament, Cameroon played their first match of the tournament against Gabon. Wearing shirt number 18, Enoh was substituted on in the 76' minute for Henri Bedimo in the 0–1 loss at the Estádio Alto da Chela in Lubango. Enoh remained on the bench for the duration of the team's next fixture, a 3–4 win against Zambia, and on 21 January 2010 played the full 90' minutes against Tunisia in a 2–2 draw, concluding the group stage, and helping Cameroon to a 2nd-place finish and placement in the Quarter-finals of the tournament. In the next stage Cameroon faced Egypt in the Complexo da Sr. da Graça in Benguela on 25 January 2010. Cameroon went on to lose this fixture against the eventual champions Egypt, in a 3–1 loss after extra time, with Enoh again playing the entire match, thus ending Cameroons 2010 African Cup of Nations campaign.

Having secured a berth at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, in South Africa in a 0–2 victory against Morocco on 14 November 2009, Cameroon were drawn into Group E of the tournament, together with Denmark, Japan, and the Netherlands. Enoh played the full 90' minutes in the team's first fixture against Japan, a match that ended in a 0–1 loss at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein. He started in the next match against Denmark, but was substituted off in the 46' minute for Jean Makoun in the 1–2 loss in Pretoria. The team's final fixture in the group stage would be against eventual group winners the Netherlands on 24 June 2010 at the Cape Town Stadium. Enoh spent the duration of their final fixture on the bench, as Cameroon lost 1–2 against the eventual runners-up of the tournament, leaving Cameroon at the bottom of their group table eliminated at the group stage.

On 26 August 2010, Enoh was declared the vice-captain of the Cameroon national team, alongside his teammate Nicolas N'Koulou who played for AS Monaco at the time of the announcement. Both vice-captains deputise Samuel Eto’o who is maintained as the skipper for the Indomitable Lions. On 17 November 2013, Enoh helped the Cameroon national team to their seventh appearance in the FIFA World Cup finals of all-time, when they defeated Tunisia 4–1 at home, helping to secure placement for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Enoh played the full 90' minutes of the deciding game at home in Yaoundé, having played a vital role for his national teams qualifying campaign in the central defensive midfield.

Enoh is a Christian. Enoh has spoken about his faith saying, "God had given me talents and the ability to play football—a great platform to share Jesus. Through football I can reach people who look up to me in my country and people I meet through my career. It has become the pathway through which the Lord can use me."

Andriy Yarmolenko

Andriy Yarmolenko (; born 23 October 1989) is a Ukrainian professional footballer who plays as a winger or forward for English club West Ham United and the Ukraine national team.

Yarmolenko has been a full international for Ukraine since 2009, scoring 37 goals in 83 matches and playing at UEFA Euro 2012 and Euro 2016.

Yarmolenko's parents, native Ukrainians, were originally from Kulykivka Raion, Chernihiv Oblast. After marrying, his mother was offered a job in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), Russian SFSR, and moved there, later joined by her husband. Shortly after the birth of Andriy, the family moved back to their native land, to the city of Chernihiv.

Yarmolenko is a pupil of the Chernihiv youth system. He joined the Dynamo Kyiv Youth Academy at age 13. However, he returned to Chernihiv after a year, unable to endure the physical demands of training. At the start of his professional career, he played at local clubs and Desna Chernihiv before joining Dynamo again.

In December 2006, Yarmolenko signed a five-year contract with Ukrainian club Dynamo Kyiv, where he joined its second team, Dynamo-2, which plays in lower leagues, for a couple of seasons. The talented youngster was praised as the "new Sheva" by journalists, who noted his qualities of good physique, shot and especially his speed. The then vice-president of Dynamo, Yozhef Sabo, also praised the youngster, saying, "Yarmolenko has all the makings to become a top-level player."

On 11 May 2008, Yarmolenko debuted for Dynamo's first team in an away match against Vorskla Poltava and scored the winning goal in Kyiv's 1–2 victory. He scored 7 goals in 21 games in his first season and 11 in 19 in his second. He is now regularly used as a left or centre forward.

In a match in October 2015, Yarmolenko committed a dangerous challenge which almost broke Shakhtar Donetsk player Taras Stepanenko's leg. The two reconciled after the game and exchanged jerseys, but afterwards Yarmolenko threw Stepanenko's shirt on the ground while he thanked the Dynamo fans. In the
Shakhtar–Dynamo derby in April 2016, after the former won 3–0, Stepanenko stepped in front of the Dynamo fans kissing his Shakhtar badge. In a brawl that escalated, Yarmolenko kicked Stepanenko to the ground.

On 28 August 2017, Yarmolenko signed a four-year contract with Borussia Dortmund. On 10 September 2017, Yarmolenko made his debut for Dortmund as a substitute in the 79-minute against Freiburg. He then got his first start for Dortmund against Tottenham Hotspur in a Champions League fixture, where he scored Dortmund's only goal in the 3–1 defeat.

On 11 July 2018, Yarmolenko signed for Premier League club West Ham United on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut on 12 August in a 4–0 defeat by Liverpool. Making his first start for West Ham on 16 September, he scored his first two goals for the club in a 3–1 away win against Everton, the club's first Premier League win of the 2018–19 season. Yarmolenko suffered an Achilles tear on 20 October 2018 in a 1–0 loss against Tottenham Hotspur, which ruled him out for the remainder of the season.

Yarmolenko returned to the first team squad for the start of the 2019–20 season. On 31 August 2019, he scored his first goal since his return from injury, doubling West Ham's lead with a left-footed volley in a 2–0 win over Norwich City. He netted again in West Ham's next home match in the Premier League, opening the scoring in their 2–0 defeat of Manchester United.

On 11 August 2007 Yaromolenko represented Ukraine under-19 team in an away exhibition game against Japan, winning 1–0. He also participated in the 2008 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualification.

After the qualification on 10 October 2008, Yarmolenko was invited to the under-21 squad which played against the Netherlands. He later participated in qualification and finals of the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship.

On 5 September 2009, in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification game against Andorra, Yarmolenko made his first senior appearance for Ukraine and scored in a 5–0 win. On 2 September 2011, in an international friendly against Uruguay in Kharkiv, Yarmolenko set a national team record by scoring 14 seconds into the match, the fastest time in which a Ukraine national team player has scored a goal.

Yarmolenko scored a hat-trick on 15 November 2014, netting all of Ukraine's goals in a 3–0 victory away to Luxembourg in UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying. In November 2015, Yarmolenko scored in both legs of Ukraine's 3–1 play-off victory over Slovenia to qualify the nation for Euro 2016 final stages. Yarmolenko was subsequently included in Ukraine's squad for Euro 2016, where he played in all three matches as Ukraine failed to score and finished bottom of the group.

Born in Carenage, Hyland began his career in 2007 with San Juan Jabloteh. In May 2007 it was announced that English side Portsmouth were close to agreeing a deal for the player. In August 2007, Hyland went on trial with Scottish side Celtic, but a £450,000 bid from the club was turned down.

Hyland had to wait for a work permit to join Portsmouth, and it was announced that he would move to the club's Belgian feeder club, Zulte Waregem.

Hyland's loan move to Zulte Waregem was made official in January 2009, but his future at Zulte-Waregem became unsure when both clubs decided to stop their partnership in June 2009. Two weeks later it was announced that Hyland was now signed on a permanent basis.

He signed permanently for Genk in August 2011.

He made his full international debut in January 2008 against Puerto Rico, and made an appearance against England on 1 June 2008. Khaleem scored his first international goal on 7 June 2008 against Jamaica in a Friendly match at the Marvin Lee Stadium.

James Bailey (footballer)

James Joseph Bailey (born 18 September 1988) is an English footballer who most recently played for Yeovil Town. He primarily plays in midfield, but can also play as a right-back.

Bailey signed his first professional contract in the summer of 2007 and made his full Crewe debut at right back at 19 years of age, when he came on as an 89th-minute substitute for Danny Woodards in a League One home fixture against Doncaster Rovers on 22 December 2007, with Crewe 2–0 down. Doncaster scored twice in the final minute for a final scoreline of 4–0. This proved to be Bailey's sole appearance of the 2007–08 season, but he earned a one-year deal with the club, which he signed in May 2008, with first team coach Steve Holland stating "We are delighted that James has signed a new contract. He has been given another year and we will review it again in relation to his progress. He has made progress this year and now it is up to him to go on again and compete for a place in the squad."

An impressive pre-season saw Bailey return to the side for the opening fixture of the 2008–09 season, where he started in his now familiar midfield role, as Crewe lost 2–1 to Brighton & Hove Albion. Although the season was a disappointing one for Crewe, who were relegated to League Two, it was a personal success for Bailey, as he kept his place in the side with a number of mature performances in central midfield alongside Michael O'Connor and earned a new and improved contract until 2011, as he recorded 31 league and cup appearances throughout the campaign, with only injury preventing him appearing in more after he was ruled out for much of the season from January onwards.

Bailey retained his position in the first team for the club's 2009–10 season, making 23 appearances in all competitions. His performances for Crewe impressed and he was linked with a move to Championship club Derby County, alongside Crewe teammate John Brayford, in a joint £1m deal in May 2010, where he was seen as a long term replacement for veteran midfielder Robbie Savage. Crewe confirmed that an offer for the pair, believed to be £1m rising to £1.3m with add-ons and a percentage sell on clause, had been accepted on 18 May 2010.

Bailey formally completed his move to Derby County on 19 May 2010 for an undisclosed fee and took the number 16 shirt, signing a three-year contract. On this signing, Derby manager Nigel Clough said,"James is a determined midfielder who has been impressive every time we have watched him and we're delighted he has… joined us."

He was placed straight into the first team during the club's 2010–11 pre season fixtures, as a holding midfielder alongside Robbie Savage in a 4–2–3–1 formation, scoring in a 3–3 draw at A.F.C. Bournemouth. His competitive debut for the Rams came in a 2–1 victory at Leeds United on the opening game of the 2010–11 season. His first goal came in a 2–2 draw with Queens Park Rangers in a performance which earned him a place in the Championship Team of the Week for 31 August 2010. He was ever-present in the first 18 games of Derby's 2010–11 campaign, playing every minute of every match and only missed his first game in November when he was ruled out with the flu. Bailey picked up the Sammy Crooks Young Player of the Year award in his first season with the club. Bailey said after picking this award, "It's a great feeling to get the young player of the year award and it's good that the manager has thought highly of me. Hopefully I can press on now and get player of the year, voted by everybody, next season."

Bailey started the 2011–12 season in Derby's first XI, helping them to four wins from their first five games and into second in the table, before an ankle injury sustained in training in September 2011 ruled him out for three months. Upon his return, Bailey struggled to break into the first team, after losing his place to Jeff Hendrick. In the January transfer window Bailey was linked with moves away from Pride Park with Premier League clubs reportedly interested in the player.

In May 2012, Derby said they were open to offers for the player and on 22 May 2012, Bailey was transfer listed by the club with a year left on his contract. Clough said the reason why Bailey was transfer list was down to the form of Hendrick and Craig Bryson in central midfield. In July 2012, Clough said that they had received "one or two" enquiries for Bailey but no firm offers. Despite this Bailey's contract was extended until the summer of 2014. On 25 September 2012, Bailey joined League One side Coventry City on loan for three months. At the completion of his loan spell, Bailey featured 18 times for Coventry, scoring one goal in Coventry's 1–1 draw at Preston North End on 22 December. Bailey said he was unclear about if he would rejoin the Sky Blues in the January transfer window, stating the Derby and Coventry were in talks over his future. Bailey returned to Coventry on a loan until the end of the 2012–13 season on 1 January. Bailey played a further 15 times in his second loan spell, scoring one goal against Oldham Athletic on 19 January. In May, Bailey was placed on Derby County's transfer list with a year left on his contract.

Bailey, however was unable to find a club in the summer transfer window and in late August he was ruled out for six weeks with a torn knee ligament. Bailey continued to be rehabilitated throughout the month and made his return in the club's U21 reserves against Hull City U21 reserves; a game which was won by Derby. After the match, Bailey describe his return from injury as 'new lease of life'. Despite being fit throughout the season, Bailey's first team opportunities were hard to come by under Manager Steve McClaren. He made just two Derby County appearances in over a year, against Blackpool and Chelsea.

After four years at the club, Bailey was finally released after his contract expired in the summer.

Bailey remained a free agent until on 22 July 2014, Bailey signed a two-year deal with League One side Barnsley.

Bailey made his Barnsley debut, playing as a right-midfield, in a 1–0 loss against Crawley Town in the opening game of the season. However, Bailey didn't make a perfect start when Bailey sustained a groin injury and then sent-off after a second bookable offense, in a 2–1 loss against Peterborough United on 18 October 2014. Bailey was them dropped out in the first team for nearly two months. Bailey's performance against Colchester United on 6 April 2015 was praised by Manager Lee Johnson. However, Bailey was dropped from the first team for the rest of the season, with Manager Johnson quoting: ""His range of passing is very good. But the tactical, physical and mental sides need to be improved."" In his first season at Barnsley, Bailey made twenty-nine appearance in all competitions.

However, on 23 July 2015, it was announced that Bailey left the club by mutual consent to allow him to pursue other football opportunities.

Bailey was signed by Indian Super League club FC Pune City on 30 July 2015 for the 2015 Indian Super League.

On 15 January 2016, Bailey signed with the Ottawa Fury.

Bailey left the club on 13 December 2016.

On 3 February 2017, Bailey returned to English football to sign for League Two club Carlisle United on a short-term contract until the end of the season. At the end of the season, having helped Carlisle reach the League Two play-off semi-finals Bailey was offered a new contract with the Cumbrian side, but this offer was withdrawn on 9 June 2017.

On 4 July 2017, Bailey signed for fellow League Two club Yeovil Town on a two-year contract.

In the 1999 Grand Final against Sydney United, Lozanovski was awarded the prestigious Joe Marston Medal in South Melbourne's 3-2 victory.

Lozanovski's success at South Melbourne paved the way for him to link up with fellow Socceroo Mark Rudan at then-2. Bundesliga club Alemannia Aachen.

Memo Arzate

Guillermo "Memo" Arzate (born November 22, 1981) is an American former professional soccer player.

Memo Arzate attended Artesia High School from 1995 to 1999. He was a member of the Pioneers' soccer team which won back-to-back Suburban League Championships in '97 and '98. Arzate was a three-time Artesia High School MVP, as well as league MVP when he was a sophomore and junior. He was also recognized as the Pioneers' Offensive Player of the Year in '96 and '97.

Following an impressive high school career, Arzate was already garnering interest from professional scouts, but elected to attend Compton Community College, a route which would be later followed by Gaucho alum Tino Nuñez. With the Tartars, Arzate completed two seasons and was named First Team All-South Coast Conference and Conference MVP in both seasons. He amassed 18 goals and 27 assists in 2001 for an astonishing 63 points in a single season. The offensive output certainly turned heads, that of Tim Vom Steeg in particular.

Memo Arzate was recruited to finish his junior and senior years at the University of California, Santa Barbara following his stellar offensive output with Compton Community College. During his junior year, he contributed immediately. He saw action in 21 games, scoring 4 goals and assisting in 18 assists for 26 points. The total was good for 3rd on the team, surpassing eventual professionals in David McGill, Neil Jones, Alan Keely, Tony Lochhead, Nate Boyden. The offensive output guided the UCSB Gauchos to their first ever NCAA playoff appearance, defeating University of San Diego 2-0 at Harder Stadium before falling at University of California, Berkeley Golden Bears 2-1.

As a senior, Arzate played in 22 games, 21 of those started. He increased his point total to 30 points with 6 goals and 18 assists. The total put him in a three-way tie for the team lead with Drew McAthy and Neil Jones. With points aplenty, UCSB received a first round bye into the NCAA playoffs and beat previous tournament opponent University of California, Berkeley Golden Bears 2-0 at Harder Stadium, before falling 3-2 in double overtime at St. John's University in the Sweet 16. For his career, Arzate recorded 0.84 assists per game, which is the 6th best total in NCAA Division I history (with a minimum of 30 career assists). In 2003, his 18 assists led him to a 0.82 assists per game ratio, the highest in the NCAA Division I that year.

Despite UCSB not being a "traditional" college soccer powerhouse, Memo Arzate was getting looks from the professional ranks. He caught the eye of Sigi Schmid and the Los Angeles Galaxy, who in turn drafted Memo with the 2nd pick of the 3rd round (22nd overall) in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft. With the Galaxy, he made an appearance in a pre-season friendly against the San Jose Earthquakes in his old stomping ground Harder Stadium, home of the UCSB Gauchos. While a hit with the Santa Barbara fans, the Galaxy grew more disillusioned with the pick and Arzate did not make the Galaxy's 2004 roster.

Memo took matters into his own hands and went to Seattle, Washington, in hopes of joining up with the Seattle Sounders. Unfortunately, he was not signed by the Sounders, but another Pacific Northwest USL First Division team took notice.

After being referred to the Portland Timbers by fellow Santa Barbara native Hugo Alcaraz-Cuellar, Arzate impressed with his performances. He was eventually signed at the end of training camp. The Santa Barbara reunion was short-lived however, as Arzate was released following the completion of the 2005 season. He appeared in 5 games for the club.

For his time at UC Santa Barbara, Arzate was named the 2003–04 Male Athlete of the Year by the "Daily Nexus".

Dragan Okuka

Dragomir "Dragan" Okuka (; born 2 April 1954) is a Serbian football coach and former player.

As a player, he was predominantly associated with his time with Velež Mostar where he won the 1981 Yugoslav Cup before joining Swedish club Örebro SK, the place his son, professional footballer Dražen, was born before ending his career soon after.

Starting his management career with FK Bečej, Dragan would win his first coaching honours with FK Obilić when he won the 1997–98 Yugoslav league title with them. Since then he has achieved success with Polish club Legia Warsaw and managed Serbian U-21 to a fourth-place finish within the 2006 European Under-21 Championship. He has also managed several other clubs.

Okuka, born in Porija, Kalinovik, PR Bosnia and Herzegovina, started his football career playing for Velež Nevesinje. However, he reached his affirmation at Yugoslav First League club Velež Mostar and in his debut season was part of the squad that narrowly missed out on winning the 1973–74 league title on goal difference to HNK Hajduk Split. After several seasons within Velež Mostar's midfield Dragan would go on to win the 1981 Yugoslav Cup and Balkans Cup with the club, while also gaining a BA in Law from the University of Mostar. Having spent the majority of his career in Velež Mostar (11 years, except one season he spent on loan at Leotar Trebinje), Dragan Okuka would join Swedish football Division 2 side Örebro SK for a short period before ending his career with Swedish lower league side Motala AIF.

He represented Yugoslavia at the 1979 Mediterranean Games and has played 4 matches scoring one goal for the Yugoslav U-21 team.

After he retired, he would move back to Yugoslavia and return to his first club Velež Mostar, where he took the position of general manager within the team by 1990. His time at the club was short-lived, and he would soon have to face challenges outside football when his life would be disrupted by the Bosnian War in 1992, however in 1994 Dragan would make his first foray into management when he was hired by struggling Yugoslavian team FK Bečej and lead them to fourth within the 1994–95 league season. This would be enough for Dragan to lead the team to the 1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup, where the club were knocked out in the group stages; however, despite this, Dragan would soon attract the interests of FK Čukarički, who he stayed with for one season. 
Still regarded as one of the country's most promising coaches, he would join highly ambitious football club FK Obilić despite the questionable ownership of career criminal Željko Ražnatović. While at the club he would employ a 3-5-2 formation as the club won the 1997–98 league title for the first time. Dragan would only stay with the club for one season, as Željko Ražnatović's ownership of the club came into question, and, despite having the chance to manage in the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League, Dragan decided to join FK Budućnost Podgorica the following season.

After a short stint with FK Vojvodina in 2000, Dragan would move away from the Yugoslavian league and join top tier Polish side Legia Warsaw, where he would soon get them to play in a 3-4-1-2 formation and eventually aid them to the 2001–02 Ekstraklasa league title at the end of the season. The following season wasn't so happy for Dragan, as Legia Warsaw were knocked out early within the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League while also having an underwhelming league season, which saw him replaced by Dariusz Kubicki at the end of the season.

After spending eighteen months out of coaching, he was offered the chance to manage the Serbia and Montenegro under-21 team, where he used a 4-4-2 formation to help guide the team to the 2006 European Under-21 Championship. At the tournament he would go on to guide the club to a semi-final position as the team narrowly missed the final in a penalty shoot-out against Ukraine. Once the tournament finished Dragan would return to club football with Polish side Wisła Kraków, who were looking for someone to improve upon their last season's result of second within the league. Already several games into the season expectations were still high despite the previous manager Dan Petrescu being fired after a slow start; however, Dragan was not the manager to change the club's fortunes and was fired two months later after only eight games, with the club languishing in mid-table.

Dragan would move around Europe, first with Cypriot side AC Omonia, where he played a 4-2-3-1 formation with little success before leaving the club after only several months. He wouldn't wait too long before joining Bulgarian side Lokomotiv Sofia in June 2008; however, the highlight of his reign was a short stint within the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, and, after being unable to mount a title challenge during his time with the club, they decided not to renew his contract. This saw him move to Greek side Kavala F.C., but he only stayed with the club for five mouths and was replaced with Henryk Kasperczak. Deciding not to stay within Europe, Dragan would accept the management position from Chinese top-tier football club Jiangsu Sainty, who he joined half-way through their 2011 league season and within his debut season guided the club to their best-ever finish of fourth at the end of the campaign. He would strive to make Jiangsu Sainty the Chinese Super League runner-up in 2012, with only 4points to equal Marcello Lippi's Guangzhou Evergrande at the end of the season. Okuka would receive the honour of Chinese FA Coach of the Year for his wonderful coaching performance in 2012 and he was to gain popularity among soccer fans throughout China. Okuka won his first title for Jiangsu in the 2013 Chinese FA Super Cup bu beating Super League and FA Cup winners Guangzhou Evergrande 2-1. However, Jiangsu Sainty spent most time in struggling at the edge of relegation in the 2013 season and finally avoided relegation by beating Qingdao Jonoon just one point. The club decided not to extend his contract at the end of the season.

Brian Etheridge (footballer)

Brian George Etheridge (4 March 1944 – 26 March 2011) was an English professional footballer and manager. He played in the Football League for Northampton Town and Brentford and later played in Belgium. He managed non-league clubs Corby Town, Wellingborough Town and Rushden Town.

Etheridge began his career at hometown Fourth Division club Northampton Town. By the time he made his debut for the club during the 1962–63 season, the Cobblers had been promoted to the Third Division. Northampton's ascension to the Second Division at the end of that season further harmed Etheridge's first team chances, with his best appearance tally being 9 league games during the 1964–65 season. He departed the club in February 1966, having made just 17 league appearances and scored one goal in four-and-a-half seasons at the County Ground.

Etheridge joined Third Division club Brentford in February 1966 for a £8,000 fee and quickly won a place in the team. A poor 1965–66 season culminated in relegation to the Fourth Division, with Etheridge having made 16 appearances. Etheridge found himself in the reserve team during the 1966–67 season and made just eight first team appearances. He experienced some joy with the reserves and won the 1966–67 London Challenge Cup with the team. Etheridge departed the Bees at the end of the 1966–67 season, after making 24 appearances and scoring two goals during 18 months at Griffin Park.

In the summer of 1967, Etheridge moved to Belgium to sign for First Division club Daring Club de Bruxelles, managed by Englishman Billy Elliott. He played in roughly half the club's matches and made 14 appearances and scored one goal during the 1967–68 season. He broke into the team in the following season and 28 appearances, scoring three goals and making appearances in Daring's 1968–69 Fairs Cup campaign. Despite European football, a disastrous season saw the club relegated to the Second Division. Etheridge departed Daring at the end of the campaign, after making 40 league appearances and scoring four goals for the club.

Etheridge transferred to Second Division club Cercle Brugge prior to the beginning of the 1969–70 season. In a one-season stay, he made 26 appearances and scored no goals.

Etheridge returned to England in 1970 and signed for Southern League Premier Division club Bedford Town. He failed to last with the club and dropped down to the Southern League First Division to sign for Corby Town in November 1970. He ended his playing career with Southern League club Wellingborough Town and United Counties League outfit Rushden Town.

While at Corby Town, Wellingborough Town and Rushden Town, Etheridge combined his playing duties with that of managing each club.

While with Northampton Town, Etheridge won 18 caps for England Youth. He was joined in the team by fellow Cobblers graduates Tommy Robson, Jim Hall and Graham Carr.

After leaving professional football, Etheridge became a businessman and was a partner in a packaging firm, based in Wales. He was married to Pauline and had two children. Etheridge hanged himself at his home in March 2011, having suffered from depression and made several attempts on his life previously. Etheridge's grandson, Tom Collins, is a rugby union winger and full back for Northampton Saints and has been capped at England U20 level.

Slaven Stjepanović (Cyrillic: Славен Стјепановић; born 2 November 1987) is a Montenegrin professional footballer who plays as either an attacking midfielder or winger for FK Zvijezda 09 in the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Born in Vareš, Stjepanović spent his formation at Brčko rivals, Jedinstvo and Lokomotiva, in his native Bosnia and Herzegovina. He would go on to make his senior debuts with Montenegrin side Zeta during the 2005–06 Serbia and Montenegro SuperLiga, which would be the competition's final edition. In the inaugural 2006–07 Montenegrin First League, Stjepanović was the team's second-highest scorer with 12 goals, helping Zeta win the title. He additionally caught the attention of numerous clubs following his promising displays against Scottish champions Rangers in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League qualifiers.

On 31 August 2007, on the last day of the summer transfer window, Stjepanović was acquired by Partizan, alongside his teammate Marko Ćetković, signing a four-year deal.

Shinji Kagawa

Shinji Kagawa ( "Kagawa Shinji" ; born 17 March 1989) is a Japanese professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Spanish club Real Zaragoza and the Japan national team. Kagawa began his professional career in his homeland with Cerezo Osaka before joining Borussia Dortmund in 2010. After two years with Dortmund, Kagawa signed for Manchester United on a four-year contract. Two years later, he returned to Dortmund. He is known for his "vision, technique, movement and deft passing". Kagawa holds the records for most appearances and goals by a Japanese player in UEFA club competitions.

Since making his senior international debut in May 2008, he has won over 90 caps and scored over 30 goals. On 29 November 2012, Kagawa was named Asian Football Confederation International Player of the Year.

Kagawa was born in Kobe, Hyōgo Prefecture. He started playing football at the age of five. He joined Marino Football Club from 1994 to 1999, Kobe NK Football Club from 1999 to 2001, and FC Miyagi Barcelona in Sendai from 2001 to 2005.

Cerezo Osaka noticed his talent and signed him at the age of 17. He was the first player in Japan to sign a professional contract before graduating from high school, except players promoted from youth teams of the J.League clubs. In 2007, he gained a regular position but the club missed promotion to the J.League Division 1. It was in 2009 that he became the top scorer of J.League Division 2 and drew widespread attention.

In the summer of 2010, Kagawa transferred from Cerezo to Borussia Dortmund for €350,000. The relatively modest cost of the transfer was because of a release clause in Kagawa's contract with Cerezo, which allowed him to leave the club cheaply if he had an opportunity to play in Europe.

On 23 August 2010, he made his debut appearance in the Bundesliga, starting for his new club Dortmund. After scoring his first two competitive goals for the club in the UEFA Europa League qualifying tie against Qarabağ FK, he continued this form with his first goal in the Bundesliga match against VfL Wolfsburg, which Dortmund won 2–0. In the Revierderby against arch-rivals Schalke 04, which Dortmund won 3–1, Kagawa claimed pre-match that he would score two goals; he managed to indeed score twice, making him a fan favourite in the process.

Kagawa missed half of the Bundesliga season because of an injury he picked up on international duty with Japan, but managed to score eight goals in 18 appearances. His strong effort in the first half of the season helped his side finished as champions of the Bundesliga, and he was even named in the Bundesliga Best XI.

Kagawa was back in time for the start of the 2011–12 Bundesliga campaign and quickly found his way back into the starting line-up. Kagawa scored his first goal of the new Bundesliga season on 18 September, coming on in a disappointing 2–1 loss to Hannover 96, as Dortmund gave up two goals in the last three minutes. On 22 October, Kagawa opened the scoring in the seventh minute as Dortmund crushed 1. FC Köln 5–0 in front of 80,200 home fans at the Signal Iduna Park. Kagawa scored again on 5 November, as Dortmund brushed aside VfL Wolfsburg 5–1 and moved within two points of league leaders Bayern Munich. Kagawa scored a late consolation against Arsenal in a 2–1 loss in the group stage of the Champions League.

On 28 January 2012, Kagawa scored twice in Dortmund's 3–1 win against Hoffenheim. Kagawa scored the only goal of the game against Werder Bremen on 17 March, heading in a pass from İlkay Gündoğan in the eighth minute. Kagawa scored two goals in Dortmund's 6–1 thrashing of Cologne on 25 March, keeping Dortmund five points ahead of Bayern in the title race. Kagawa won the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund in 2012 as they set a Bundesliga record scoring the most points in a season in the Bundesliga, with 81. Kagawa also scored a goal and provided an assist for Dortmund against rivals Bayern Munich in the 2012 DFB-Pokal Final. He scored a total of 13 goals and had 8 assists during that season.

On 5 June 2012, it was announced by Manchester United that the club had reached an agreement with Borussia Dortmund and Kagawa for his transfer, a deal that made him the first Japanese player to join the club. The fee was reported to be an initial £12 million, with a further £5 million in possible add-ons. The transfer was completed on 22 June after Kagawa passed his medical at Manchester United and received his UK work permit. On 3 July, it was revealed that Kagawa would wear the number 26 shirt for United. Kagawa spoke about his former club, Borussia Dortmund, saying, "I will carry this club, their great fans, and the whole city in my heart forever and will follow their results with great interest."

On 18 July 2012, Kagawa was handed a two-minute appearance to mark his Manchester United debut in Durban, South Africa, against AmaZulu in a pre-season friendly match. Kagawa made his first start for the Red Devils against Ajax Cape Town on 21 July 2012, and scored his first goal against Shanghai Shenhua four days later. He made his Premier League debut on 20 August 2012, playing the full 90 minutes of United's 1–0 defeat away to Everton. He scored his first goal against Fulham on 25 August in his home debut for the club. After Tom Cleverley's shot was parried by Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, Kagawa scored on the rebound from close range. On 19 September, Kagawa was given his first Champions League start as United played against Galatasaray. He provided an assist for the winning goal scored by Michael Carrick in a 1–0 win. On 23 October, he set up Javier Hernández for United's first goal in an eventual 3–2 Champions League victory against Braga. In that match, however, he twisted his knee, which left him sidelined for two months. Kagawa returned from injury in January 2013.

On 2 March 2013, Kagawa scored his first hat-trick for United and also became the first Asian player to score a hat-trick in the Premier League, in his team's 4–0 home win against Norwich City. On 22 April, Kagawa played a part in the title-winning match against Aston Villa in which United won 3–0; he became the first Japanese player to win a Premier League title. On 12 May, Kagawa was included in the United squad to play against Swansea City in Alex Ferguson's last home game before retirement, which United won 2–1. On the same day, Kagawa received his Premier League medal and was voted Man of the Match.

On 31 August 2014, Kagawa officially returned to his former club, Borussia Dortmund, for an undisclosed fee thought to be around £6.5 million and signing a contract until 30 June 2018. He was assigned the shirt number 7 which was vacated by Jonas Hofmann who had left Dortmund to 1. FSV Mainz 05 on loan. On his return debut, Kagawa scored a goal and set up another to help Dortmund win 3–1 against SC Freiburg.

On 14 July 2017, Kagawa extended his contract with Dortmund until 2020.

In the first half of the 2018–19 season, a combination of injury and coach Lucien Favre's preference to play Marco Reus as a central attacking midfielder meant Kagawa played just four times for Dortmund. That led to Kagawa joining Turkish club Beşiktaş on loan for the remainder of the season.

On 9 August 2019, Kagawa completed a transfer to Real Zaragoza of Spain's Segunda División, penning a two-year contract. He debuted for the club on 17 August 2019, in the 2019–20 Segunda División opening match against Tenerife at La Romareda, which Zaragoza won 2–0. Eight days later, he scored his first goal in a 1–1 draw against Ponferradina.

Kagawa played as a member of the Japan national under-20 football team in the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup held in Canada.

In 2008, he was also selected to play as a member of the Japanese team for the 2008 Summer Olympics.

On 24 May 2008, he made his senior international debut in a friendly Kirin Cup match. Japan won the match against Ivory Coast 1–0. However, was not selected in Takeshi Okada's final 23 squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. In September 2010, he scored the only goal of the game in Japan's win over Paraguay in Yokohama.

Kagawa was included in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup by coach Alberto Zaccheroni. In the quarter-final against Qatar, he scored two goals. The game ended in 3–2 win for Japan. In the semi-final against South Korea, Kagawa broke his metatarsal bone and missed the final where Japan beat Australia after extra-time.

Kagawa was named in Japan's 23-man squad for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and scored the second goal for his country during the group stage match against Italy, which ended in a 4–3 loss. He was selected for his first World Cup in 2014, but made little impact as the "Samurai Blue" was eliminated at the group stage.

At the 2015 AFC Asian Cup, Kagawa scored Japan's second goal during a 2–0 defeat of Jordan in the group stage and was named as man of the match.

Kagawa participated in Japan's quarter-final match against the United Arab Emirates. After the match ended 1–1 after extra time, Kagawa, who was Japan's final kicker in the penalty shoot-out, hit the post with his kick, as Japan ended up losing the shoot-out 5–4.

A technically and creatively gifted player, Kagawa is a versatile attacking midfielder who primarily plays in a playmaking role. He can additionally play on either the left or right flank. Kagawa has good composure on the ball and disciplined decision making and passing. He is an agile player who tends to roam around the opponents' defense looking for an intelligent and creative pass or through ball. He has great attacking play both on and off the ball. He also has great attacking positioning which allows him to have one of the best eyes for goal. Perhaps his best qualities are his agility, passing discipline, creativity, positioning during attack and the ability to pick out a key pass. He's fairly quick and can attack and score goals himself. Whilst playing for Japan, he has played in a left midfield, or a central attacking midfield role.

Atif Bashir

Atif Qureshi Bashir (born 3 April 1985) is an ex-professional football player, whose career came to an end due to extensive knee injuries over the past three years. His latest club football was with Dinas Powys and at international level for the Pakistan national team.

Born to a German-Turkish mother and British-Pakistani father, Bashir is a defender who is equally comfortable playing at right-back, in the centre of defence, Bashir spent seven years as a youth at professional clubs such as Hertha Berlin and Cardiff City.

After leaving Cardiff City, Bashir signed for Afan Lido in 2004 and played 11 games scoring 1 goal for the club. After one season with Lido, he went to Maesteg Park A.F.C. in 2005 and spent one season playing 32 games and scoring two goals. He then went to Cardiff Grange Quins in 2007, making eight appearances in the Welsh Premier League, scoring one goal. He had a short spell at the Welsh Premier League team Haverfordwest County A.F.C. and then moved to Barry Town, where he impressed and became a fans' favourite, also becoming Barry's first international player, making headlines and appearing 45 times and scoring five goals for the club. He later on made a move to Bridgend Town in 2010 but in the same year he returned to Barry Town.

In July 2010, Bashir had a trial with English Conference National side Luton Town. He impressed the fans in a pre-season friendly match against Dunstable Town, but he was surprisingly not offered a contract by Luton Town manager Richard Money.

In August 2010, he had a trial with another English Conference National side, Histon, playing in a pre-season friendly match against Dagenham & Redbridge. A transfer to Histon looked set to happen, but Histon manager John Beck resigned shortly after Bashir's trial, so he returned to Barry Town for the start of the 2010–11 season.

In October 2010, and then again in November 2010, Bashir undertook trial spells with Conference North outfit AFC Telford United.

Bashir undertook a trial spell with Conference National side Newport County in July 2011, featuring in a pre-season friendly match against Mangotsfield United.

In September 2011, Bashir was awarded a full university football scholarship and has since been involved in all games in the BUCS premier league representing his University at the highest level in England and wales.

Bashir stills plays for Barry town football club, still being a fans favourite to this day. During the 2012–13 season, whilst playing against his former team Haverfordwest, he sustained an injury which put him out for the rest of the season and possibly the rest of the 2013–14 season.

at the beginning of the 2014-15 season, Atif Bashir returned to game action for Barry town. Though there was delight of his return, Bashir did not give the potential into starting in the squad. After a few games with the club, he departed from the club and joined local rivals, Dinas Powys.

Akhtar Mohiuddin has stated that "...born to a British-Pakistani father and a Turkish German mother, Atif could have theoretically played for Germany, Turkey, or any of the British Home Nations, as well as Pakistan whom he eventually chose. He made his debut for Pakistan in the 2008 SAFF Championship against the host Maldives, followed by matches against India and Nepal".

In 2008, Bashir was called up to represent Pakistan. Although initially part of the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup squad, he could not join the team because his Pakistani passport had not been issued. A few months later, Bashir made his International Debut for Pakistan in the 2008 SAFF Championship against the Maldives, before facing India and Nepal in the first round.

In October 2010, he was also included as one of three overage players in an under-23 Pakistan squad for the 2010 Asian Games in China, where Pakistan faced Thailand, Maldives and Oman in November 2010.

In March 2011, Bashir represented Pakistan in their unsuccessful 2012 AFC Challenge Cup qualifying campaign, appearing at the heart of the defence alongside Zesh Rehman in defeats to Turkmenistan and India. However, he helped Pakistan to victory in their final match, scoring the second goal in a 2–0 win over Chinese Taipei at the MBPJ Stadium with a long-range strike that saw Pakistan finish third in Group B.

He continued to cement his place as a regular in the Pakistan national side, featuring in both legs of the 2014 World Cup qualifiers against Bangladesh in June and July 2011.

Saúl then joined Levante UD for 2007–08, in another troubled campaign with the club submersed in deep financial problems and eventually dropping down to the second level.

Vicente Iborra

Vicente Iborra de la Fuente (; born 16 January 1988) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for Villarreal CF.

He amassed La Liga totals of 230 matches and 32 goals over nine seasons, representing in the competition Levante, Sevilla and Villarreal and winning the Europa League three times with the second club. In the summer of 2017, he signed with Leicester City of the English Premier League.

Born in Moncada, Valencian Community, Iborra was a product of Levante UD's youth system. He made his first-team debuts during the 2007–08 season, as the club's severe financial problems prompted the exit of several players. After appearing in a Copa del Rey match against Getafe CF on 9 January 2008, he played in La Liga against Real Madrid four days later (0–2 home loss).

On 30 March 2008, Iborra scored his first Levante goal, a last-minute effort in a 1–2 loss at UD Almería. In the 2009–10 campaign, as the side returned to the top flight after a two-year absence, he was one of the team's most used players — 36 games, 2,640 minutes — netting once.

Iborra joined fellow league club Sevilla FC on 16 August 2013, after agreeing to a five-year contract. He finished his debut season with 41 games and four goals all competitions comprised, including 12/1 in the UEFA Europa League which his team won.

In 2014–15, Iborra was often deployed in a more attacking midfield role by manager Unai Emery, and responded by scoring nine goals overall. On 24 September 2016 he filled in as the goalkeeper for the final two minutes away to Athletic Bilbao when Salvatore Sirigu was sent off, conceding a penalty from Aritz Aduriz in a 1–3 loss.

Sunderland agreed to pay Sevilla £7 million for Iborra, but called it off on 30 August 2016 as the summer transfer window came to a close. Under new coach Jorge Sampaoli he started the new season as a reserve but, on 11 December, after having replaced the injured Nicolás Pareja at half-time of the away fixture against RC Celta de Vigo, he netted a hat-trick which included a late penalty in a 3–0 win.

On 6 July 2017, Leicester City announced they had signed Iborra on a four-year contract for £15 million. After picking up a groin injury during pre-season, he did not make his debut until 19 September, when he played the whole of a 2–0 home win over Liverpool in the EFL Cup and provided the assist for Shinji Okazaki's goal. His maiden Premier League appearance took place on 30 September as he played the second half of a 0–0 draw away to AFC Bournemouth, and he scored his first goal in the latter competition on 4 November in a 2–2 draw at Stoke City. 

On 7 January 2019, Iborra joined Villarreal CF on a four-and-a-half-year deal for a reported fee of £9 million. He cited failure of his family to adjust to life in England as the main reason for his departure.

Dunne signed for League One side Stevenage in May 2012. Although he was out of contract at Exeter, Stevenage still had to pay a fee for the player because Dunne was under 24 years of age. The fee for Dunne was set by a tribunal after the two clubs failed to agree a price for the player. This fee was later revealed as an initial £75,000, with a further £50,000 payment dependent on appearances. The move reunited Dunne with then Stevenage manager Gary Smith, who had previously coached him during his time at Wimbledon. He made a goalscoring debut in Stevenage's 3–1 home win over AFC Wimbledon in the League Cup, taking advantage of Seb Brown's goalkeeping mistake, tapping the ball into an empty net, to double Stevenage's lead shortly before half-time. Dunne scored his second goal for the club in November 2012, netting with a 30-yard effort in a 3–2 away defeat to Rotherham United in the FA Cup.

His fourth goal of the season came in the club's first home game of 2013, rifling in a shot from 30-yards to give Stevenage the lead in an eventual 2–1 defeat to Doncaster Rovers. Dunne added to his tally the following month, scoring from the edge of the area in another 2–1 home loss, this time to Oldham Athletic.

Player of the Year 2012/13"></ref>

Ahead of the 2013–14 season, Dunne had attracted interests from Championship and League One clubs, including Celtic, Bristol City and Bournemouth. Manager Graham Westley would sell Dunne and Lucas Akins if the price for the duo is right. After not featuring for one match in the opening game of the season, Dunne made his first appearance of the season, coming on as a substitute in the 49th minutes, in a 1–0 loss against Swindon Town. Two weeks later, Dunne scored his first goal of the season in injury-time goal, to give Stevenage their first win of the 2012–13 season against Notts County.

The club's chairman, however, revealed that he tried signing Dunne permanently, but unexpectedly low takings from the final prevented this, quoting: ""We made a bid for James Dunne at Stevenage but the figures I was given for the cup was nothing like the reality. That amount of money has not materialsed. It's £120,000 less. The SFA take something like a 42 per cent cut of the figure I was given.""

Maybe I would have got dragged down that road that some of my friends have gone, I don’t know. From the age of six though, I always wanted to play football and my brother and I would play every minute that we had that was free."

Milan Badelj

Milan Badelj (; born 25 February 1989) is a Croatian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Fiorentina, on loan from Lazio and the Croatia national team. He is a member of the Croatian squad which finished as runners-up to France in 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Milan Badelj signed for Dinamo Zagreb as a 17-year-old in 2007, just after he was snapped up from the youth system of Dinamo Zagreb's city rival, NK Zagreb. For the 2007–08 season, he was sent on loan to Dinamo Zagreb's affiliate Lokomotiva to gain first–team experience at the senior level. He played in 28 matches and scored seven goals for Lokomotiva in the Croatian Third League.

At an early age, Badelj was already spotted as a possible replacement for Luka Modrić, a key figure in the Dinamo Zagreb first-team squad that joined Tottenham Hotspur in 2008.

In 2008, Badelj joined the first team and immediately established himself as an important player. He made his senior debut for Dinamo in Champions League qualifier against Northern Irish club Linfield. He then made his domestic debut in the opening match of the 2008–09 season against Rijeka, scoring the first goal in 2–0 victory. He finished his first season with Dinamo with 31 domestic appearances and 12 UEFA Cup appearances.

Badelj continued to impress at his young age, establishing himself as a first–team regular for the 2009–10 season. In March 2011, he scored a goal in a 2–0 victory in the derby match against great rivals Hajduk Split. Badelj continued with impressive performances in the 2010–11 season as well, even wearing the captain's armband in some matches.

In the 2011–12 season, Badelj was one of the key players in the Dinamo squad that reached the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League group stage for the first time in 12 years. He appeared in all six of Dinamo's group stage games against Real Madrid, Lyon and Ajax.

In what would be his final game at the Stadion Maksimir for Dinamo, in a Champions League playoff match against Slovenian side Maribor, Badelj scored an own goal that gave the opposition an equaliser in the first leg match. However, Badelj later scored the winning goal at the other end in the second half.

Badelj joined Hamburger SV of the Bundesliga in August 2012 for an undisclosed fee thought to be in the region of €4.5 million, according to the Croatian media. He made his domestic debut soon after joining the club in a match against Werder Bremen. He soon established himself as a first-team regular, typically operating as a deep-lying playmaker. Badelj scored his first Bundesliga goal against Schalke 04, in a 3–1 win, on 27 November 2012.

On 31 August 2014, it was announced Badelj had signed for Serie A side Fiorentina for a fee believed to be in the region of €5 million. After the death of Davide Astori, he was appointed as team captain.

Badelj joined Lazio on 1 August 2018, on a free transfer.
On 17 February 2019 he scored his first goal for the club in a 2-1 loss to Genoa

On 5 August 2019, Badelj joined Fiorentina on loan until 30 June 2020 with an obligation to buy. On 3 September 2019 he wore captain armband in 1-1 draw against Parma, despite being a loaned player, due to absence of regular captain Germán Pezzella. It was the first time for Badelj to being captain since his comback.

During his youth career for the national team, Badelj earned a total of 63 caps, for all youth teams from U16 to U21.

In 2010, Badelj was selected for the Croatia national team squad for the first time, but was mostly on the bench. His competitive debut came during a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying match against Malta; a match Croatia won 3–1, on 2 September 2011, in which Badelj scored the second goal. He was selected for the UEFA Euro 2012 squad; and in May 2014, was selected for the final squad at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil following an injury to Ivan Močinić. However, he was an unused substitute for most of the tournament, as Croatia were knocked out in the group stage. He was selected for UEFA Euro 2016.

In May 2018, Badelj was selected for the final 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. He scored his first goal of the tournament in a 2–1 win over Iceland; helping Croatia en route to topping the group on maximum points. On 1 July, in Croatia's round of sixteen tie with Denmark, the game was drawn 1–1 and was decided through a penalty shootout in which Badelj missed Croatia's first penalty, though they would scored three while their opponents only scored two.

It was revealed by Pakhtakor that Odil Ahmedov had received offers from foreign clubs such as the Russian Premier League members Krylia Sovetov Samara and FC Dynamo Moscow. But "Pakhtakor" officials believed that Odil Ahmedov deserves a better offer referring to the top European clubs such as the ones from England, Spain, Germany, Italy, and France.

After his stunning performance at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, a lot of clubs showed interest in him, for example the Russian teams such as Rubin Kazan, Anzhi Makhachkala, and Lokomotiv Moscow, Spanish side Málaga CF, English side Bolton Wanderers, French side AS Monaco, Saudi side Al-Ittihad, Ukrainian sides Dynamo Kiev and Metalist Kharkiv, and the Turkish side Beşiktaş J.K.. The highest prices were from the Saudi side Al-Shabab who have offered 8 million euros, and the Qatari side Al-Gharafa offering 12 million euros.

Since the European transfer window closed on 31 January, Odil Akhmedov could not play in a European club till the summer transfer window opens. He still have had the offer from Al-Shabab for 8 million euros, and Al-Gharafa for 12 million euros, he needed to make his decision before the clubs canceled their offer, or else he might be left at his current club Pakhtakor.

There were rumours that Odil Akhmedov was seen in front of the Jeonbuk's office.

On 4 February 2011 U.F.F. revealed that Odil Akhmedov moved to Russia where he would play his next season, but the name of the club was not revealed. According to unknown source Odil Akhmedov was going to play at Anzhi Makhachkala. "Anzhi" coach Gadzhi Gadzhiev revealed that the club didn't sign Odil Akhmedov. He went to Belek, Turkey, with his current team Pakhtakor Tashkent, and this is the same place where "Anzhi Makhachkala" is training. According to Pakhtakor, real offers only came from Al-Shabab and "Anzhi", and rest was just rumours being spread. Pakhtakor also announced that Odil Akhmedov had been loaned to "Anzhi Makhachkala" for one year.

There has been rumours that England's Arsenal has been interested in Odil Akhmedov. Later Akhmedov confirmed the interest by Arsenal F.C..

On 13 February 2011 Ahmedov scored his first goal in his first match for Anzhi in friendly match against Obolon (Ukraine) with 1–0 win. He made his official debut in Russia in 2010–11 Russian Cup Round of 16 match against Zenit Saint Petersburg on 1 March 2011.

On 29 December 2011 "Anzhi Makhachkala" official website announced Ahmedov was named as the best player of the club over season 2011. The winner was determined with the survey conducted among official website visitors and finally by club managers and coaches. He collected more points than Samuel Eto'o and Yuri Zhirkov.

It was rumoured that he was set to leave "Anzhi Makhachkala" in summer 2014. England's Arsenal gave a bid of 4 million pounds, followed by Genoa and A.C. Milan.

Prior to Anzhi suffering relegation, Ahmedov joined Krasnodar in early June 2014, along with teammates Nikita Burmistrov and Vladimir Bystrov. Weeks later, he was handed the number "10" shirt.

On 28 June 2014, he scored first goal on his debut match in friendly against Qarabağ FK in Austria. The game ended with 1–0 victory of Krasnodar. On 3 July 2014 he scored his second goal on his second appearance for FC Krasnodar to equalize against Scottish football giants Celtic F.C., due to an awful defending error they made. Unfortunately, the game ended 3–1, with FC Krasnodar losing.

Ahmedov scored his first official goal for Krasnodar on 1 August 2014 in 2014–15 UEFA Europa League third qualifying round match against Hungarian outfit Diosgyori VTK. Krasnodar won the match by 5–1, with Ahmedov scoring the team's second goal in the first half.

On 17 August 2014, Odil Ahmedov scored his first official league goal for Krasnodar against FC Rostov in a 2–0 win. He scored the second goal of "Krasnodar" against Rostov in second half, assisted with a cross by Vladimir Bystrov.
On 6 March 2015, UFF announced results of pool conducted among journalists for "Best Footballers of the Year" award and Ahmedov was named Uzbekistan Footballer of the Year for the third time.

Ahmedov was named "Best Player of FC Krasnodar in 2014–15 season" on 9 June 2015 after survey conducted on club official website. On 4 March 2016 he was named the "Best Football Player 2015 in Uzbekistan" for the 4th time as Football Federation announced the results of the survey.

He made his international debut with Uzbekistan in a 9–0 win against Chinese Taipei on 13 October 2007.

He is known for his tough tackling style and thunderbolt shots. It is said that he 'releases the Kraken' almost like John Arne Riise and it may be true as he scored the goal and possibly goal of the tournament of the 2011 AFC Asian Cup.

On 10 October 2019, Ahmedov played his 100th match for Uzbekistan against Yemen.

Mick Clavan

Matthijs "Mick" Clavan (11 March 1929 – 11 July 1983) was a Dutch footballer. He enjoyed a long career on both club and international level, currently having the third longest international career in the history of the national team with nearly seventeen years. He played on the left side of the pitch, mainly as a left winger and inside left, but later in his career also as left midfielder and left back.

Born in The Hague, Matthijs Clavan started his club career with RVC Rijswijk before moving to ADO. At the age of 15, he acquired the nickname Mick, as his speed and cunning playing style drew comparisons with Mickey Mouse. Aside from his footballing skills, Clavan also showed a capricious character, such as when in 1951, while on military service, he insulted a sergeant and was convicted to two months in jail.

In 1954, professionalism was introduced to Dutch football, which prompted Clavan to move to the newly formed "paid club" SHS. Here, he formed a successful partnership with fellow left-sided forward Bertus de Harder. In 1956, he returned to ADO, which also had begun to pay its players. During the 1956–57 season, he helped ADO to achieve promotion to the Eredivisie. He also helped them reach the final of the KNVB Cup in 1959. In 1962, he returned to SHS (later renamed Holland Sport), which was by then playing in the second division. He retired at the age of 37.

On 26 May 1948, aged 19, Clavan made his debut for the Dutch national side, scoring once in a 2–1 away win against Norway. He was subsequently selected for the Dutch squad at that year's Summer Olympics, but did not make an appearance. By the end of 1950, he had gained 12 caps, but due to his fickle character, Clavan's international appearances became more scattered after that. He was selected for the 1952 Summer Olympics, where he played in the Netherlands' only match, a 1–5 defeat against Brazil.

On 3 April 1957, Clavan gained his 24th cap in a 1–2 home defeat against West Germany. He would subsequently not be called up for more than five and a half years, until November 1962, when Elek Schwartz recalled Clavan, by now 33 years old and playing for a second tier club, for a European Championship qualifier against Switzerland. He helped the team win the home match 3–1. Almost two years later, in October 1964, Clavan was recalled again, this time for a World Championship qualifier against Albania. With him, the Netherlands won this away match 2–0. Clavan gained his final cap on 26 January 1965, aged 35, as a substitute for Klaas Nuninga in a 1–0 away win against Israel. In total, he earned 27 caps, in which he scored 7 goals.

Clavan's international career lasted 16 years and 245 days, which makes him currently the footballer with the third longest "Oranje" career, after Abe Lenstra (19 years and 19 days) and Bertus de Harder (16 years and 363 days).

After retiring, Clavan managed amateur team Ooievaars. On 11 July 1983, he died as a result of a heart attack. He was 54 years old.

Daniel Owusu

Daniel Owusu (born 13 June 1989 in Accra) is a Ghanaian footballer.

Tom Vernon, Director of the Right to Dream Academy said “In my experience in football, nobody has worked harder to earn a professional contract and nobody deserves a contract more than Daniel. With his attitude it is simply impossible to predict how far Daniel can go in the game”.

Following a trial period at Fulham, Owusu signed for the club during the summer transfer window of 2007.

Talking about the moment he signed his professional contract, Daniel said ""this is what I’ve wanted since I was a small boy, this was my dream to become a professional in Europe, my family, my friends, everyone at the Academy knew this was my dream. Signing is just the beginning, I have so much I want to do, I want to work hard and make my club, the Academy and my family proud. This is just the start, I have a lot of work ahead of me and I’m ready! I want to thank everyone who has helped me and who continues to support me, especially Tom and the whole Academy.""

General Manager of the Academy, Samuel Mawuena, who has known Daniel from before he joined the Academy knows what this chance means to him ""Daniel comes from a very tough background in Labadi, one of the poorest areas of Accra. The positive and negative experiences that Daniel went through during childhood, that remain with him as he has grown up, has made Daniel the person he is now and has helped to drive him forward and make him hungry for success. Daniel has made this opportunity happen for himself, he has an excellent attitude which has led him to where he is now. This first contract is a life changing opportunity for him and will have such an impact beyond just Daniel. Everybody in his family and the community will be looking up to him. Although this is a massive change for Daniel, it will help him and the people around him.""

Philippe Vorbe (born September 14, 1947) is a former Haitian footballer who played as a midfielder for the Haiti national football team in the 1974 FIFA World Cup in West Germany. A legendary player in Haiti, he provided Emmanuel Sanon the pass that resulted in the famous goal that put an end to Italian goalkeeper Dino Zoff's no-goal streak. Vorbe played for the New York Generals and Violette Athletic Club. He ascended from player to leader and is now the coach of Violette.

Vorbe was described in a February 1974 "Observer" article by Hugh McIlvanney as a "tall, handsome white man of French extraction" and a "graceful midfield player" with "impressive skills".

Having qualified for the 1974 World Cup by first knocking out Puerto Rico in a play-off, then topping the final group in the capital Port-au-Prince, Haiti was drawn into a very difficult group featuring two-time champions Italy, future champions Argentina, and Poland, who managed third place in the tournament.

The most famous goal of Haiti's World Cup run occurred against Italy. The "Azzurri" had not let in a goal in 12 games prior to the World Cup, thanks to goalkeeper Dino Zoff. However, in the opening of the second half, Emmanuel Sanon shocked the Italians with the opening goal, thanks to a spot-on pass from teammate Philippe Vorbe. However this lead didn't hold and Italy went on to win 3–1.

A former member of the Bolton Wanderers Academy, Richman worked his way up the ranks from the Port Vale youth team to the Reserves and broke into the main team in the 2007–08 season, signing his first professional contract in April 2008.

At the beginning of the 2008–09 season he established himself as a first team regular, earning eight consecutive starts and also got his first league goal. However, as the season went on the Valiants made numerous loan signings and Richman went out of favour. On 6 December 2008, he came on as a substitute against Grimsby Town, scoring an 88th-minute winner. This gave manager Dean Glover a selection headache as the youngster battled with more experienced players for a first team slot. Following that match he played another 21 games that season, his consistent performances earning him the club's Young Player of the Year Award.

He picked up a groin injury in pre-season which sidelined him for several months. He was later transfer listed in late September, despite being injured, along with the entire Port Vale squad, after manager Micky Adams saw his team slip to a third consecutive defeat. In January 2010 he received interest off League Two club Grimsby Town and Scottish First Division side Ayr United. His agent, former Vale legend Phil Sproson, believed a loan move would be in the player's interests. On 20 February he made his first appearance in four months, replacing Tommy Fraser in a 2–0 defeat by Barnet. In April 2010 he learned that he would not be offered a new contract by manager Micky Adams.

In July 2010, Richman enjoyed a trial at Conference National club, and Conference North title holders Southport. The next month he was on trial at Worcester City, where former teammate Danny Glover had found a home. He signed a contract with the club soon after. He enjoyed a solid start to his career, and claimed that the club helped him to rediscover his passion for the game. Throughout the season he earned praised for his energy levels and work-rate.

Offered a new contract by Worcester, Richman instead opted to sign with league rivals Altrincham. He took this decision as his new club was closer to his Liverpool home, and because he had played under new manager Lee Sinnott at Port Vale. Richman made his Altrincham debut as a substitute in a 1–1 draw against Workington. He scored his first Altrincham goal in his second appearance, again as a substitute, in 3–0 win over Histon. The club missed out on the play-offs by 11 points in 2011–12, before securing a play-off spot by an 11-point margin in 2012–13. They were beaten 4–2 by Brackley Town in the play-off semi-finals, despite Richman scoring in a 2–1 victory at Moss Lane. The "Robins" again qualified for the play-offs in the 2013–14 campaign, and Richman played in the final as the club secured promotion with a 2–1 extra-time victory over Guiseley.

He played 43 games in the 2014–15 season to help Altrincham post a 17th-place finish. He made 42 appearances across the 2015–16 campaign as they were relegated in 22nd position. He played 33 games in the 2016–17 season as Altrincham were relegated out of the National League North in last place. They made an immediate return however, winning the Northern Premier League Premier Division title at the end of the 2017–18 season, with Richman scoring four goals from 42 matches. On 26 December 2018, Richman made his 300th appearance for Altrincham in a 2–0 defeat at Stockport County. He ended the 2018–19 season with one goal in 40 appearances, helping Altrincham to the play-offs, where they were defeated by Chorley on penalties in the semi-finals.

Lennon picked up his first win for St Mirren with a 1–0 win over Hibernian, courtesy of a goal from Craig Dargo. The Buddies finished the season in 11th place, just managing to avoid relegation.

Over the summer, Lennon decided to make wholesale changes in the playing and backroom staff and also developing a new formation and philosophy. Lennon's signings included Scottish internationals, Gary Teale from Sheffield Wednesday and Steven Thompson from Burnley. He also added Dutch players Nigel Hasselbaink and Jeroen Tesselaar while replacing long term assistant manager Iain Jenkins with a more experienced coach in Tommy Craig.

László Raffinsky

László Raffinsky () (born 23 April 1905 in Miskolc, Hungary (Austria-Hungary) - died 31 July 1981 in Cluj-Napoca, Romania) was a Romanian football player of Hungarian ethnicity who was a member of Romanian team which participated at the 1930 FIFA World Cup in Uruguay and 1938 FIFA World Cup in France. He holds the record for most goals scored in a Liga I match, scoring ten goals in the match between Juventus Bucureşti and Dacia Unirea Brăila from 1929-1930 season.

László Raffinsky begun his football career in 1924, playing for Unirea, a football club from Timişoara. In 1925, Raffinsky moved to CA Timişoara, and then, in 1927, at Chinezul Timişoara, one of the Romania's best clubs at that time. But Raffinsky's new club entered in a financial crisis, and for the first time in seven years, Chinezul lost the Romanian championship. Eventually, Raffinsky leaves Chinezul in 1929, signing with Juventus Bucureşti. In 1929-1930 season of Liga I, Raffinsky won his first title of champion with Juventus. In 1931, he returns to Timişoara, playing for another symbol of interwar period Romanian football, Ripensia. He leaves Ripensia in 1933, after winning another Liga I - champion title, leaving Romania for playing in Czechoslovakia, at SK Židenice. He returns in Romania after two years, his come-back to Bucharest, where he previously played at Juventus, being linked with a move to Rapid. He played until 1940 for Rapid, winning for three times the Romanian Cup. In 1939, he was arrested, together with another three players of Rapid, Iuliu Baratky, Ştefan Auer and Ioan Bogdan, because of their win in the final of the Romanian Cup against Venus Bucharest. They were arrested at the order of Gabriel Marinescu, the Minister of Internal Affairs and the Prefect of Bucharest, who was also the chairman of Venus. After a huge scandal initiated by the press, the four players were released from the jail after a few days, and Gabriel Marinescu was arrested and executed in 1940. In 1940, Raffinsky retired from his playing career.

László Raffinsky won twenty caps for the Romania national football team. His first match for Romania was a defeat, in 1929, against Yugoslavia. At his fourth match for the national team, Raffinsky scored his first and only goal for Romania, against Greece. In 1930, he was called to the Romanian squad which participated at the first FIFA World Cup, in Uruguay. But the chairman of Astra Romana, a company where Raffinsky and his team-mate Emerich Vogl were office workers, interdicted the two players to leave their workplace. At the intervention of Octav Luchide, the two players eventually took the SS Conte Verde ship to Uruguay. In Uruguay, Raffinsky played in the both matches for Romania, against Peru and Uruguay. In the match against Peru, he was fouled by Plácido Galindo of Peru, who was dismissed for the foul, being the first player ever to be dismissed at the FIFA World Cup. He was also included in the 1930 FIFA World Cup Best Eleven. Raffinsky was not called up again at the national team until 1932, when he played in a 6-3 victory of Romania against France. After another three consecutive matches against Greece, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, Raffinsky was not called up until 1937. In 1938, he was called again at a FIFA World Cup, playing for Romania in the two matches against Cuba. These two matches were the last matches at the national team for Raffinsky.

Despite being a successful player, László Rafinsky was not a great manager. He began his managerial career in 1944, coaching Prahova Ploieşti. He was the manager of the team from Ploieşti until 1945. He was the manager of another few Liga II and Liga III clubs, like Mica Brad, Chimica Târnăveni or Aurul Zlatna. In 1962, he moved to Cluj-Napoca, being for two years the manager of Tehnofrig, a small football club of the factory with the same name. In 1964, Ladislau Raffinsky retired from football.

Marcel Cas

Marcel Cas (born 30 April 1972) is a Dutch former professional footballer and current fitness coach for Eredivise side Feyenoord.

As a player, he was a midfielder from 1995 until 2005, playing in both his native land and in England, notably for RBC, Notts County and FC Den Bosch, as well as also turning out in brief spells with Sheffield United and Grimsby Town.

Born in Breda in 1972, Cas started his career playing for RBC Roosendaal in 1995, quickly established himself into the team making 121 first team appearances, scoring 13 goals before securing a move to England in 2001. Cas joined Football League Division Two side Notts County in the summer of 2001. He remained at Meadow Lane until 2003, following 58 appearances and 8 goals.

Sheffield United signed Cas in 2003, but found it hard to find his way into the plans of manager Neil Warnock and he was released at the end of the 2002-2003 season, following only 6 league appearances. Cas returned to the Netherlands for preseason training, but began to talk to several clubs back in England, and this was eventually confirmed when it was announced that he had flown into Humberside Airport in June 2003 to sign a one-year contract with Grimsby Town, where he joined Tony Crane as the club's first new signings for the 2003–2004 season. Despite being signed as a right-sided midfielder, a position he had played in all his career, he would eventually come to a disagreement with manager Paul Groves who preferred to play him at right-back, whilst Jason Crowe, a natural of that position, was played in Cas's favoured slot. This was something that unsettled Cas, who eventually fell out with Groves, thus paving the way for his departure from Blundell Park in January 2004.

Upon his departure, Cas commented "I'm a midfielder...not a defender" to the media in relation to his spat with Groves that had effectively ended his time at Grimsby. Cas re-signed for RBC Roosendaal in 2004, but in a half-year spell back at the club he was plagued with injuries. He departed in summer 2004 having only featured in 16 league matches.

Upon his departure from RBC, he signed for FC Den Bosch in 2004, but decided to retire due to a persistent back injury in November 2005, following 11 years as an active professional footballer.

At the beginning of the season 2009/2010 season, Dutch side Feyenoord announced that Cas had joined the club's backroom staff, working in the medical department after spending two years as a fitness coach at RKC. In 2013, he became the clubs fitness coach.

Upon his return to California, Avila was briefly a member of Chivas USA's U-19 club.

Prior to enrolling in college, Avila was ranked as the 2nd best midfielder and 6th best prospect overall in the class of 2005 by StudentSportsSoccer.com. Avila was recruited with a scholarship to attend the University of California, Santa Barbara by head coach Tim Vom Steeg. Avila was the marquee signing in a class that contained future professionals Chris Pontius, Alfonso Motagalvan, and Ryan Kenny.

Avila scored his first goal of the 2012 season against Real Salt Lake April 28 in a 3–2 away defeat.

On December 14, 2012, Avila was selected by Colorado Rapids in stage two of the draft. About a month later, Avila was traded to Chivas USA for Nick LaBrocca. Avila went on trial with C.D. Guadalajara of the Liga MX on two occasions but the club never signed him. There was also speculation that Santos Laguna were going to sign him but the negotiations seemed to stop.

Avila joined Orlando on a loan from Santos Laguna. He scored his first goal May 17, 2015 against LA Galaxy in which Orlando City SC won 4–0. Avila made 21 appearances for Orlando in 2015, totaling 1,325 minutes of play.

Piero Braglia

Piero Braglia (born 10 January 1955) is an Italian football manager and former player. He most recently worked as the manager of Cosenza.

A midfielder, Braglia started his professional career with Serie C team Montevarchi, then making his debut in the Serie A in 1976 with Fiorentina. He then spent six seasons with Catanzaro, five of them being in the Italian top flight. He then retired in 1987 after spells with Serie B teams Triestina and Catania.

In 1989 Braglia accepted his first managerial job, at the helm of amateur Tuscan team Bibbienese. He then coached a number of Tuscan teams in the lower ranks of Italian football with some success, including a Serie C2 title with Montevarchi in 1995.

In 1999, he accepted his first coaching job outside of Tuscany, becoming head coach of Foggia in the Serie C2, obtaining a fourth place in the final table. He then returned to Tuscany, again to Montevarchi, before to join Chieti, which he led for two seasons in the Serie C1 league. In 2003–04 he returned to Catanzaro, this time as a head coach, and led the "giallorossi" to win the Serie C1 title and establish them back in Serie B after over a decade in the lower tiers. He was however sacked during the club's following Serie B campaign due to poor results. He then returned in Tuscany, joining Sangiovannese, a team he already twice in the Serie D during his early coaching years, and achieving an impressive third place in their Serie C1 campaign. In 2006, he accepted an offer from Pisa, with the aim to lead the "nerazzurri" back to Serie B; a third place in the regular season, followed by a successful campaign in the promotion playoffs, assured Pisa and Braglia a place in the second-highest Italian league for the next season. However, after discussions with the club management, Braglia opted to leave Pisa and accept an offer from Lucchese, another Tuscan Serie C1 team with aims of promotions. However, despite this, Lucchese ended only in eighth place and failed to qualify to the promotion playoffs.

In June 2008 Braglia was unveiled as head coach of Serie B team Frosinone, replacing Alberto Cavasin.

In June 2009 Piero Braglia went to Taranto, but was removed weeks later due to poor results. On June 2010 he was announced as new head coach of Juve Stabia, which he led to a surprise promotion to Serie B via the playoffs. He was then confirmed as Juve Stabia boss for the 2011–12 second division campaign, where he guided his small club to an impressive first season half and a good ninth place by the end of the season. Another safe season followed, with Juve Stabia keeping its Serie B status for one more year. These fortunes did not repeat in the 2013–14 season, as Juve Stabia immediately appeared unable to escape relegation and Braglia was fired in November 2013 to be replaced with Fulvio Pea; after Pea's failure to improve results, Braglia was however called back at Juve Stabia, but could not do anything to avoid Lega Pro relegation to his club.

In July 2014, Braglia agreed a comeback at the helm of Pisa, seven years after he guided them to what was the last Serie B promotion to date for the "Nerazzurri" of Tuscany.

On 12 October 2015 he became the head coach of Lecce. He led the club to the third place and thus entered the play-off round, where Lecce lost in the semifinal.

On 15 June 2016 he was appointed new manager of Alessandria. He was exonerated on 15 April 2017, three days before the end, due to the sudden collapse of results that led to overtaking the Cremonese at the top of Group A Lega Pro, after a long domination of the piedmont team.

On 27 September 2017 he was hired as the head coach of Cosenza in the Serie C. With the calabrian club, on 16 June 2018, he won the final of the Serie C playoffs against Robur Siena, with a score of 3-1 at the Stadio Adriatico in Pescara. Thus, Cosenza returns to Serie B after 15 years.

On his first season in charge at the club in Serie B, he comfortably succeeded in keeping Cosenza into the safer spots of the league table, ending in tenth place, just four points shy of a promotion playoff spot. However, the 2019–20 Serie B campaign did not prove to be as successful, and Braglia was sacked on 10 February 2020 following a 0–1 home loss to Benevento which left Cosenza in deep relegation zone (18th place).

Joakim Persson

Joakim Persson (born 3 April 1975) is a Swedish football manager and former player. He is the head coach of Varbergs BoIS.

Born in Helsingborg, Persson began his career as a youth-team player with Högaborgs before moving to Malmö FF in 1992. He made his professional debut in a Swedish Cup game against Landskrona in 1994.

Persson moved to the Italian Serie A club Atalanta in 1996. He returned to Sweden after less than two seasons in Italy, having very rarely played for Atalanta's first-team, joining IFK Göteborg in January 1998. Things went little better for him in Sweden. He was often singled out by the media as the main cause of his team's poor performances throughout his two seasons with Göteborg. After the 1998 season he was voted as the "most overrated player" in the Allsvenskan by his fellow players.

At the end of the 1999 season, Persson left IFK Göteborg in order to escape the intense scrutiny he had been subjected to. He joined Esbjerg fB, of the Danish Superliga, midway through the league season, at the end of which they were relegated to the Danish 1st Division. Persson stayed with the club and helped them to win the first division championship, and promotion, at the first attempt.

In the summer of 2002, after one further season with Esbjerg, Persson moved to Hansa Rostock of the German Bundesliga. Along with Andreas Jakobsson, Marcus Lantz, Peter Wibrån, Magnus Arvidsson and Rade Prica, Persson was one of six Swedes playing for the Mecklenburg club. Under manager Armin Veh he played as a holding midfielder, making 26 appearances in his first season with the club. The following season began with four successive defeats, after which Veh handed in his resignation and was replaced by Juri Schlünz. Schlünz converted Persson from a midfielder into a defender and appointed him as the leader of the team's back four. After making just one substitute appearance in the first six games of the season, Persson went on to start 27 of the last 28 games. He scored his only league goal for Hansa in a 1–1 draw with Borussia Mönchengladbach on 1 November 2003. Hansa finished the season in ninth place. Persson made 30 league starts during the 2004–05 season but was unable to prevent Hansa from finishing second-bottom of the league and being relegated to the 2. Bundesliga.

Following Hansa Rostock's relegation, Persson left the club to join Stabæk in Norway's Tippeligaen. Although he had been offered a longer contract, Persson decided to return to Sweden after 18 months in Norway. Persson signed with Landskrona prior to the 2007 Superettan season.

Persson made 27 appearances for the Sweden U21s, scoring eight goals. He also made five appearances for Sweden at junior level, scoring one goal.

Persson also made three appearances for the Sweden national football team, all of which came in the 1997 King's Cup. He played in games against Romania and Japan before playing in the final against the hosts Thailand. Persson scored a goal in the final, helping the Swedes to a 3–1 win.

Persson is the father of three children.

It was subsequently confirmed on 30 July, with manager Arsène Wenger stating he knew the signing was a "gamble on talent" due to the player's injury record.

On 30 June 2011, after declining all offers from Académica to renew his contract, Bischoff left the "Students". He joined former club Desportivo das Aves shortly after, for two years.

Bischoff returned to Germany in summer 2012, going on to spend several seasons in the 3. Liga with SC Preußen Münster and eventually becoming team captain. In 2012–13, he scored a career-best ten goals to help his team to the fourth position.

At the start of the 2016–17 campaign, Bischoff requested permission to be removed from the Preußenstadion-based squad, as his mind was not "in the game".

On 21 January 2017, Bischoff signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with F.C. Hansa Rostock also in the German second division. In June 2019, it was announced he would leave the club after having chosen not to accept an offer of a contract extension.

He received a three match ban, but was supported by his teammates, parents and also a Vale supporting Priest who visited him in the locker room to give Davidson support. Assistant manager Ian Brightwell believed the challenge did not warrant a sending off and the club appealed the ban, to no avail.

In March 2010 he was informed that he would not be offered a new contract by the "Valiants" at the end of the season, and immediately re-joined Stafford Rangers on loan until the expiry of their contracts.

Arfon Griffiths

Arfon Trevor Griffiths MBE (born 23 August 1941) is a Welsh former football player and manager. During his playing career which lasted from 1959 to 1979, Griffiths played at both professional and international levels, before becoming a football manager.

Born in Wrexham, Griffiths was originally spotted in local junior football by former Wrexham player Frank Blew, who then alerted the club's manager Cliff Lloyd. He initially signed Griffiths on amateur forms in May 1957, as the youngster turned down offers of trials from both Liverpool and Sheffield Wednesday. This started a 22-year-long association between with Wrexham as both player and manager.

He made his first team in a 2–1 home win over Reading in November 1959, having been a member of the previous season's successful Welsh Youth Cup winning side. He kept his place in the side for the rest of the season, collecting a Welsh Cup winners' medal from a 1–0 win over Cardiff City.

He became an established member of the side during the 1960-61 season, and it was not long before the bigger clubs began to take an interest. In February 1961 Arsenal paid £15,500 to sign him, and he made his debut in a 5–1 defeat at the hands of Wolverhampton Wanderers on 22 April 1961. He played intermittently in the 1961-62 season for Arsenal, making 14 league appearances as an attacking midfielder and scoring twice.

He gained international recognition as a member of the Wales under-23 side. Unable to maintain a first-team place at Arsenal, Griffiths returned to Wrexham who paid a record fee of about £12,000 to re-sign him.

Affectionately known to Wrexham fans as the 'Prince of Wales', he played a major part to some of the most successful years in Wrexham Football Club's history. These include guiding the club to promotion in both 1962–63 and 1969–70; winning the Welsh Cup four times; playing in three European campaigns, which included reaching the quarter-final stages of the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1976, before losing out to the eventual winners RSC Anderlecht, 2–1, on aggregate. He was awarded a testimonial match in 1972 against Bill Shankly's Liverpool, which netted him £3,000 for his testimonial fund. In total he made a club record 591 Football League appearances and scored the second-highest total number of goals in the club's history, 120.

These successes also led him on to international recognition by gaining 17 full caps, the highlight of which was scoring at the Racecourse Ground against Austria in 1975, which enabled Wales to qualify for the 1976 European Football Championship finals. He was also selected for a Football Association of Wales tour to New Zealand, Australia, Tahiti and Malaysia in 1971.

He played under eight managers at Wrexham, before taking charge himself in May 1977 following the resignation of John Neal. Griffiths had previously been his assistant manager for a year. Wrexham's directors had no hesitation in appointing him as Neal's replacement, and he kept faith with the same squad that had just missed out on promotion at the end of the previous season.

Griffiths led Wrexham to the Football League Third Division championship in 1977-78, becoming the first manager in the club's history to win promotion to the then Football League Second Division.

An abundance of unforeseen injuries affected the team's performances in the Second Division and they struggled to come to terms with a higher grade of football. On 13 May 1981, Griffiths resigned after an internal disagreement with the board. A season of heavy winter's snow had caused many cancellations and gate receipts had virtually dried up. Griffiths was asked to cut the playing staff, his backroom staff and the youth development team to reduce overheads. Grifiths refused to do so as a matter of principle and thus he left the club.

Although he began to assist Bangor City with their training in an advisory capacity, he was to make a quick return to football management, when he was appointed manager of Crewe Alexandra on 3 August 1981. He spent just over a season at Gresty Road until he resigned on 25 October 1982. He did play for his local side, Gresford Athletic, in the Welsh National League, for a short while, before finishing with football altogether to concentrate on his newsagents' shop in the village and playing golf.

Griffiths was awarded the MBE in June 1976 for his services to Welsh soccer, and in 2006 he was made club president of his home town club, Wrexham, as well as being added to the club's Hall of Fame.

Adam Buckley

Adam Christian Buckley (born 2 August 1979) is an English former professional footballer. He played as a midfielder from 1996 to 2013.

Buckley played as a professional in the Football League for Grimsby Town and Lincoln City between 1998 and 2003, after coming through the youth ranks at West Bromwich Albion. He then forged a career in non-league football and has played for Brigg Town, Harrowby United, Stamford, Spalding United, Bourne Town, Lincoln Moorlands Railway, Sleaford Town, Nettleham and Gainsborough Town.

Buckley first got his break in the professional game with West Bromwich Albion as an academy player in 1996, This was while his father, Alan Buckley was the club's manager. With limited chances though he failed to make the grade and step up to the first team at Albion, prompting Buckley to eventually follow his father to Grimsby Town in 1997, when Alan re-took the managerial post at Blundell Park for the second time.

He made his debut for Grimsby in a First Division defeat to Swindon Town on 24 April 1998. He would make one further appearance that season in another away defeat, this time to Watford. The following season, Buckley was eased into first-team action by his father, and was a regular presence on the bench during the 1999–00 campaign. During his time with The Mariners Buckley was cast aside by Grimsby supporters as a player who only featured and played professionally because his father was the club's manager.

There may have been truth in that factor as following the departure of his father from his managerial role in September 2000, Buckley junior failed to be included in any of new manager's Lennie Lawrence's teams. With this he would not even make the Grimsby substitute bench during the 2000–01, and to add to this he also struggled to hold down a place in the club's reserve team and in July 2001, his contract with Grimsby was cancelled by mutual consent.

In July 2001, Buckley joined his father once again, agreeing a two-year contract with Lincoln City. He made his Football League debut, as a substitute, for Lincoln in the 3–0 home victory over Swansea City on 25 August and was a regular presence in the first-team squad during his first season, making a total of 31 league appearances, 12 of which came from the substitutes bench.

In April 2002, due to financial constraints, Alan Buckley departed Lincoln, and under new manager Keith Alexander chances were rare. Buckley would make only three league appearances, all from the substitutes bench, during the 2002–03 season with a further three appearances in cup competitions. The season did, however, bring Buckley his only goal in his professional career when he netted a free-kick in the 2–1 home defeat to Shrewsbury Town in the Football League Trophy on 12 November 2002. Buckley like at Grimsby also found cast aside by the Lincoln City supporters for only playing a part in first team affairs because his father was the team's manager.

His career at Lincoln ended when he was arrested over allegations of theft from the club's ground in May 2003. In June 2003 he was sentenced to 120 hours of community service after pleading guilty to four counts of theft from his teammates.

Buckley then moved into Non-League football. He had an unsuccessful trial with Ilkeston Town, which was followed by a short spell with Brigg Town. He then joined Harrowby United in March 2004. In October 2005, he signed for Stamford, linking up with his former Harrowby boss Graham Drury. In February 2006, Buckley joined Spalding United on loan, debuting in the defeat to Kidsgrove Athletic on 19 February 2006; the move became permanent in April 2006.

He was released by Spalding in September 2006 and was next heard of at Bourne Town, making his debut in the 4–0 home defeat to St Neots Town on 7 March 2007. After an unsuccessful trial with Boston United in August 2007, Buckley linked up with Spalding United for a second time. Buckley then moved on to play with Lincoln Moorlands Railway in 2008. He made a brief sojourn to Sleaford Town, appearing for the club in a 1–1 friendly draw with Lincoln United on 12 November 2008, before returning to Moorlands. In September 2010, he joined Sleaford Town debuting in the 1–0 United Counties Football League Premier Division home victory over St Ives Town on 11 September 2010.

He moved on to play in the Lincoln Sunday League Premier Division for Welton Sports and joined Nettleham on the Saturdays. He then moved back to Lincoln Moorlands Railway for the remainder of the 2011–12 season before joining newly elected Lincolnshire League side Gainsborough Town in August 2012. Buckley failed to make a single appearance for Town and briefly re-joined Moorlands Railway where he eventually ceased playing competitive football in 2013.

He is the son of former Grimsby Town manager Alan Buckley, he played for his father while at West Bromwich Albion, Grimsby and Lincoln. He is also the nephew of the former Derby County and Lincoln City player, Steve Buckley. His elder brother Simon also had a short stint as a professional footballer and was contracted to Grimsby Town, West Bromwich Albion and Boston United but failed to make an appearance in the Football League.

His career at Lincoln ended when he was arrested over allegations of theft from the club's ground in May 2003. In June 2003 he was sentenced to 120 hours of community service after pleading guilty to four counts of theft from his teammates.

Buckley's son Brandon currently plays for Grimsby Town.

On 30 October 2014, Tonev was given a seven-match ban for "using abusive language of a racist nature". Celtic confirmed that they would appeal the decision, as they believe him to be innocent. Tonev then lost his appeal and Celtic decided not to take the matter any further.

On 27 August 2015, Tonev joined Serie A newcomers Frosinone on a permanent deal. He played his first game three days later, coming on as a substitute for Luca Paganini in a 2–0 loss against Atalanta at Stadio Atleti Azzurri d'Italia.

Gary McCabe

Gary McCabe (born 1 August 1988) is a retired Irish footballer who last played for Bray Wanderers as a Winger.

McCabe began his youth career at Leinster Senior League side Crumlin United. His impressive performances in the youth and intermediate ranks did not go unnoticed and attracted interest from a number of League of Ireland clubs. McCabe was eventually snapped up by Premier Division outfit Bray Wanderers for the 2007 season. McCabe broke straight into Bray's first team that season making 24 league and cup appearances and scoring 2 goals helping the Seagulls to league safety with a 9th place league finish. He scored his first Bray goal at the age of 18 during a 2–1 victory over UCD at the Carlisle Grounds on 29 May 2007.

The 2008 season started as a difficult season for McCabe. Despite Bray flying as high as 4th in Premier Division table, the left sided winger struggled for form and discipline getting sent off twice in just 9 league appearances. To regain first team football, Bray sent the young winger out on loan to First Division title chasing side Shelbourne for the remainder of the 2008 season. McCabe made his Shelbourne debut as a second-half substitute during a 2–0 defeat to Limerick 37 at Tolka Park on 11 July 2008. McCabe made 9 competitive appearances for Shelbourne during his loan spell and he impressed the Shelbourne faithful with his pace and skill.

During this time he represented Republic of Ireland national futsal team in the qualifying rounds of the 2010 UEFA Futsal Championship. He returned to Bray Wanderers following his loan spell at Shelbourne. McCabe had a revitalised season in 2009 as he finished Bray's top scorer contributing 8 goals 38 league and cup appearances, however these exploits could not prevent Bray's relegation to the First Division.

At the end of the season McCabe signed for Sligo Rovers in December 2009.

In 2010 McCabe played a vital part in Sligo Rovers' hugely successful season as they finished in 3rd place in the league and also won the League of Ireland Cup and the FAI Cup. However, McCabe's contract expired at the end of the 2010 season and he signed for The Hoops in January 2011.

He made his League debut for the Hoops in the opening night win over Dundalk.

He won the Setanta Cup in 2011 and played in the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League netting a memorable equaliser against Partizan Belgrade in August 2011 McCabe scored in the 2–1 away defeat against FK Ekranas on 25 July 2012 in the UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds. This goal was the 100th all time goal in this competition for League of Ireland clubs.

He signed a two-year contract in November 2012.

His sister Katie is captain of the Republic of Ireland women's national football team.

"Professional appearances – correct as of 27 August 2019."

Ray Walker (footballer, born 1963)

Raymond Walker (born 28 September 1963) is an English former football midfielder. He played 440 games for Port Vale in all competitions between 1986 and 1997, ensuring himself a place in the club's history. He was twice the club's player of the season, and was named on the PFA Team of the Year three times. He was promoted twice with the club and also played a part in the club's highest ever post-war finish in the English Football League.

Known as the "Hoddle of the lower leagues", Walker was an expert passer. With Aston Villa in the early '80s, he joined Port Vale in 1986, after a short loan spell in 1984. After eleven years at Vale Park he went into non-league football with Leek Town and Newcastle Town.

Walker joined Aston Villa as an apprentice in July 1979, and turned professional in September 1981. He made his First Division debut in the 1982–83 season against West Ham United.

He was loaned to Fourth Division Port Vale for two months at the start of the 1984–85 season. He played fifteen games for John Rudge's side, scoring his first goal in professional football on 15 September, in a 3–1 win over Torquay United at Plainmoor. He returned to Villa Park but failed to established himself in the first team. He returned to Port Vale (now in the Third Division) on a permanent basis in July 1986 for a fee of £12,000, plus 50% of any future sale above that amount (a fee settled by a tribunal). He played 54 games in 1986–87, scoring five goals. He was voted Player of the Year by the club's supporters in 1987–88, and was also selected by the PFA for the Third Division Team of the Year. These awards were handed to him for his performances during his 53-game season, with one of his seven goals coming against Tottenham Hotspur in a celebrated FA Cup Fourth Round upset. He handed in a transfer request in June 1988, following rumours that the club had turned down an offer of £150,000 from Manchester City; his request was rejected – much to the disappointment of Stoke City manager Mick Mills.

His partnership in midfield with Robbie Earle helped the club win promotion in 1988–89, both men being key players in the 1989 play-off final. Walker was also selected in the PFA Team of the Year for a second successive season, scoring six goals in 56 appearances. Despite this, he said "Wait until next year. I had a bad season!" He helped the club to survive and prosper in the Second Division, and recovered from injury to post 47 appearances in 1989–90. He only scored the one goal, though it came at a crucial time, helping the "Valiants" to record a 3–2 victory over top-flight Derby County at Pride Park in the FA Cup.

He was installed as the club's penalty-taker in 1990–91, and five of his seven goals came from the spot. His performances over his fifty games resulted in him being awarded the club's Player of the Year award once again in 1991, with only David Harris before him having been handed that honour twice. He was sidelined for five months with ligament damage in September 1991, and his absence during the 1991–92 was notable, and was a factor in the club being relegated, with Vale finishing just five points from safety. He recovered to make 27 appearances over the course of the season, his two goals from coming from the spot. Walker was involved in the TNT Tournament win in summer 1992. He picked up a knee injury in April 1993 and although his performances 1992–93 saw him selected for that seasons PFA Second Division side of the year, he had to undergo a cruciate ligament operation in September 1993, which caused him to miss most of the 1993–94 season. At the end of the campaign though, Vale were promoted into the First Division as Second Division runners-up.

He spent a brief five game loan period with Second Division Cambridge United in September 1994, but managed to win his place back at Vale Park upon his return. However he was struck down by another knee injury in March 1995. He played in the 1996 Anglo-Italian Cup Final, as Vale lost 5–2 to Genoa. He made nineteen appearances in 1996–97, as Vale posted their highest ever post-WW2 finish (eighth place in the second tier). He then left the club in May 1997. His many years with the "Valiants" entitled him to a testimonial game, which finished as an 8–6 defeat to Leicester City. He played a total of 440 league and cup games for the club, scoring 43 goals.

After leaving Port Vale he spent time as a player-coach with Conference new boys Leek Town, including a five-game spell as caretaker manager from 17 March 1998. Later that year he became player-manager at North West Counties League side Newcastle Town, where he remained until leaving to join the Crewe Alexandra academy in 2001. The "Castle" finished fourth in Division One in 1998–99, second in 1999–2000 and ninth in 2000–0.

Walker is now Football in the Community Officer for Crewe Alexandra.

Osvaldo Alonso

Osvaldo Alonso Moreno (born November 11, 1985) is a Cuban-born footballer who currently plays as a midfielder for Minnesota United FC in Major League Soccer (MLS). He defected from Cuba in 2007 and became a U.S. citizen in 2012. During his decade-long career with Seattle Sounders FC, Alonso played as a defensive midfielder who was known for his style of harassing, tackling and covering the field, while getting forward to supply enough offense to be considered a threat. This style of play had earned the nickname "Honey Badger" from Seattle fans for his fearless, aggressive playing style.

Alonso began his career with Pinar del Río in his homeland, after which he defected to the United States in June 2007. He trained with Chivas USA and was offered a $12,900 developmental contract with the team. Eventually, Alonso opted to sign with Charleston Battery on the theory he would get more playing time on a USL First Division team. He impressed early after a strong outing in the preseason Carolina Challenge Cup 2008 and ultimately enjoyed an impressive debut season in which he started 31 games for the Battery and scored 7 goals. He was named 2008 team MVP and Newcomer of the Year by fan votes, the team's Players' Player of the Year by a team vote, and the USL-1 Rookie of the Year by league coach and GM vote.

In 2008, Alonso was signed by Seattle Sounders FC, for whom he quickly became a regular starter at defensive midfield. In the 2009 MLS Season, he started 28 of 29 appearances in the regular season and playoffs. He played the full 90 minutes in 26 games and all 210 minutes in both playoff games against Houston. After missing three matches with a quadriceps strain, Alonso returned to score on a long-range blast against D.C. United on June 17. He finished with one goal and three assists for the season. All three assists came during first two matches. Alonso also appeared in two U.S. Open Cup games, including 90 minutes in the final.

In 2010, Alonso returned from injury to help Seattle post the league's best record in the second half of the season. He started 23 of 25 appearances in the regular season and playoffs, matching his 2009 totals with one goal and three assists. He scored the game-winner against Chivas on October 15. Alonso missed eight games due to a quadriceps strain that happened on May 8 and returned against FC Dallas on July 11. Seattle was 11-3-5 in regular season matches when he played at least 45 minutes. Alonso also appeared in two U.S. Open Cup and five CONCACAF Champions League matches.

In February 2011, Alonso signed a contract extension with Seattle through the 2014 season. In 2011, he led field players with 33 appearances and 2891 minutes (ranked 12th among field players in MLS). He played the full 90 minutes in each of his 32 MLS starts. Alonso scored a career-high three goals and matched his high with three assists. He scored the game-winner at Portland on July 10 by converting his first career penalty. He finished second on the team with 54 shots. He was selected as an MLS All-Star for the first time. He scored both goals in 2-2 draw at Comunicaciones on September 27 in a CCL Group Stage match. Alonso was named U.S. Open Cup Player of the Round for his performance in the final. (He added late goal in a2-0 win over Chicago.) He made 43 appearances and 40 starts across all competitions.

In 2012, Alonso was named to the MLS Best XI for the first time in after a stellar season in midfield, leading the team with 30 starts. He compiled a team-high 2,688 minutes in regular season play, the second-highest total by a field player in franchise history behind his 2011 total. He was named an MLS All-Star for the second straight season and voted team MVP for the third straight year. Alonso played 56 minutes in a 3-2 win over Chelsea in the 2012 MLS All-Star Game. His lone goal of the season came on a 65th minute game-winner at Colorado on July 28 when he volleyed a 12-yard shot into the back of the net. He was named the 2012 U.S. Open Cup Player of the Tournament after scoring four goals and two assists in four games, including the winner against Atlanta on May 30 and a 30-yard volley against Cal FC on June 5. For the season he totaled five goals and five assists while leading the team with 42 starts and 3,749 minutes across all competitions.

In 2013, Alonso was named an inactive MLS All-Star, earning his third All-Star selection in his five-year MLS career.

After missing games in both the 2014 and 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs, Alonso was being actively shopped around the league by the Seattle Sounders front office due to durability concerns before the start of the 2016 MLS season. A trade did not materialize, and Alonso went on to make 38 league and playoff appearances for the 2016 MLS Cup winning Sounders. He picked up an injury during the playoffs for the third season in a row during the second leg of the Western Conference Finals against the Colorado Rapids when a collision led to a sprained knee. Alonso played through the injury, playing all 120 minutes of the 2016 MLS Cup Final in a penalty shootout win over Toronto FC. He required four pain killing injections before the Final and another four injections at half time to make it through the game. Head coach Brian Schmetzer praised Alonso for his determination and service to the club after the victory.

Alonso passed 20,000 minutes played for Seattle on April 14, 2017, becoming the first to do so at the MLS level in team history and the 10th in league history to do so while playing for one team.

Following his release by Seattle, Alonso joined Minnesota United FC on 10 January 2019, having been the last Sounders player to have played for the club from its first season in MLS. At the same time, Minnesota traded for the top spot in the waiver order as well as two fourth-round picks in the 2019 MLS SuperDraft, while sending a second-round pick in the 2020 MLS SuperDraft and the fourth spot in the waiver order to Orlando City SC.

Alonso scored his first goal for Minnesota on April 13, 2019, during a 3–3 draw against New York City FC. It was also the first goal to be scored at their new home stadium, Allianz Field.

Alonso served as captain of the Cuba U-23 national team during qualification for the men's football tournament at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He made his debut for the senior Cuban national team in a Caribbean Nations Cup 2006-07 match against the Turks & Caicos Islands in September 2006. During his time with the Cuban national team, he earned 17 caps, scoring two goals. His final appearance for the national team was at the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup in June 2007 against Panama.

In June 2007, Alonso defected from Cuba while the team was in Houston, Texas, to face Honduras at the Gold Cup. Another Cuban teammate, Lester Moré, defected to the United States during the team's same trip to the United States. Alonso was with teammates at a Wal-Mart when he went off by himself while browsing through merchandise and then left the store. He walked several blocks from the store until he found a man who spoke Spanish and borrowed a cell phone to call a friend in Miami, Florida.

On June 19, 2012, Alonso became a citizen of the United States of America, and he stated that he would like to play for the United States national team despite playing for Cuba in the past. He has not been called up to the Cuban national team since he defected to the United States. The FIFA statutes state that:

"If a Player who has been fielded by his Association in an international match in accordance with art. 5 par. 2 permanently loses the nationality of that country without his consent or against his will due to a decision by a government authority, he may request permission to play for another Association whose nationality he already has or has acquired."

Goran Vučević

Goran Vučević (born 18 May 1971) is a Croatian former professional footballer who played as a central midfielder.

He spent most of his professional career with Hajduk Split (in several capacities, including player and manager) and Barcelona (mostly with the reserves).

Born in Split, Croatia, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Vučević started his career at local HNK Hajduk, where he became a key player at only 18, eventually winning the 1992 Sportske novosti Yellow Shirt award, issued to the best footballer playing in the Croatian League at the end of every season.

Afterwards, Vučević was bought by Johan Cruyff's FC Barcelona. During his five-year stay, he could never break into the first team, which also featured – as the clubs in Spain were not allowed to field more than three foreign players at the same time – Luís Figo, Gheorghe Hagi, Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Romário or Hristo Stoichkov; in December 1993, he was ousted from the squad by the Dutch manager after refusing to return to the B-side, and in the following off-season was loaned to Hajduk, where alongside experienced players such as Stjepan Andrijašević, Aljoša Asanović and Igor Štimac he helped to a double conquest – the first since 1975 – and a quarter-final run in the UEFA Champions League.

After two loans, first loaned to his former club then CP Mérida, the latter also in La Liga, Vučević was finally sold in the 1997 summer to 1. FC Köln. He also struggled immensely in Germany, playing very rarely including when the team was in the second division. In 1999, he returned for a third spell with Hajduk, retiring after two unassuming years.

From 2005 to 2008, still with Hajduk Split, Vučević accumulated the tasks of assistant to the main squad and youth coach, taking the first team's reins in May 2008 but resigning in October, after which he returned to the youth system. His second spell as manager started on 16 November 2010, when he replaced Stanko Poklepović; in April 2011, having already been ousted from the group stage of the UEFA Europa League and having failed to win the national championship during the club's 100-year celebration season, he was sacked.

Vučević returned to Hajduk Split in December 2013 as director of football, thanks to president Marin Brbić. In April 2015, he again replaced Poklepović for a third spell as head coach, but was himself relieved of his duties after only two games, one of them resulting in elimination from the Croatian Football Cup at the hands of RNK Split. He received threats to both him and his family from the fans, but continued to work as sporting director afterwards; in March 2016, he was criticised for his methods and blamed for the team's negative run in the league, offering his resignation which was taken into consideration.

On 1 April 2016, Vučević resigned from Hajduk after Brbić left his post.

Over the course of one week, starting on 5 July 1992, Vučević played three times for the Croatian national team. All of his caps were won in friendlies against the same opponent, Australia.

Gerhard Progni

Gerhard Nik Progni (born 6 November 1986) is an Albanian professional footballer plays as a midfielder for SC Gjilani.

A Partizani Tirana product, Progni has played for several clubs in Albania, including Skënderbeu, whom he won one Albanian Superliga title.

Progni began his career with Partizani as a child, where he played for the youth teams within the club. During the 2004–05 season with Partizani's U-19 side, he won the national championship and he caught the attention of the senior team, who towards the end of the season invited to train with them. He was promoted from the U-19 side at the end of the season, and was loaned out to Albanian First Division side Kastrioti for the 2005–06 season in order to gain first team experience. During his year on loan he became an integral part of the first team squad as a teenager and with his good performances and 3 league goals he even helped the club achieve promotion to the Albanian Superliga after finishing third.

Following a success loan period at Kastrioti, Progni returned to his parent club Partizani and signed a three-year contract with the club. During the 2006-07 campaign he became an important first team player, making 29 league appearances and scoring 2 goals in the process, helping his side finish 4th in the league as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Albanian Cup, narrowly losing out to beaten finalists Teuta on away goals. The following season, he played for Partizani until January, making 11 league appearances, before leaving the club for Besa Kavajë.

Porgni signed for Besa in January 2008 and immediately became an important member of the first team, making 16 league appearances and scoring 1 goal, helping the club finish third in the league behind his previous team Partizani. He also scored a goal in the Albanian Cup with Besa, where the club reached the quarter-finals. The following season Porgni remained in Kavajë and he made his European debut in the Intertoto Cup against Cypriot club Ethnikos Achna, where he was in the starting lineup for both legs, helping Besa to a 1–1 aggregate win on an away goal. In the next round his side faced Swiss outfit Grasshopper Club Zürich, who beat Besa 5–1 on aggregate, with Progni playing the full 90 minutes in both games. Domestically, Besa did not have a successful season, finishing 7th in the league, just 2 places above the relegation play-off spots. Progni did however have a successful individual season, scoring 4 league goals in 28 games, and by scoring 3 goals in 6 cup games.

Progni left Besa Kavajë at the end of the 2008–09 season and joined Dinamo Tirana in the summer transfer window. At Dinamo he had a difficult time attempting to break into the first team, as the squad had an array of talent in the midfield positions, including Emiljano Vila and Elis Bakaj, meaning Progni's chances were limited. He left the club in January and made just 5 league appearances during his short time at Dinamo, all of which were substitute appearances. His only goal for the club came in the Albanian Cup against Adriatiku.

After a less than fruitful short spell with Dinamo Tirana, Progni joined Flamurtari in January 2010 and immediately became and important player, featuring in 16 league games in the second half of the season, all of which were from the starting lineup. The following season Progni remained an integral player and his performances exemplified this, as he scored 6 goals in 30 league games, which helped Flamurtari to 2nd place in the Albanian Superliga. At the end of season he went on a trial with Romanian Liga I champions FC Oțelul Galați, accompanied by fellow Albanian and former Oțelul Galaț player, Arben Kokalari. His trial at the club was not successful, so he remained at Flamurtari for the following 2011–12 campaign. He featured in both Europa League games against Baumit Jablonec in the second qualifying round, which ended in a 7–1 aggregate loss for Flamurtari. In the league campaign Progni played in 28 league games and scored 8 goals, helping Flamurtari finish 4th in the Albanian Superliga. In the cup, Progni featured in 12 games and scored 1 goal as Flamurtari reached the semi-finals, losing out to eventual winners Tirana.

Progni signed for newly promoted side FK Kukësi in the summer of 2012, who under the guidance of the club president Safet Gjici had an ambitious project to be one of the best clubs in the country.

In October 2013 the club captain Rrahman Hallaçi gave up his duties, making Progni the club's captain for the reminder of the season.

On 10 June 2014 reigning Albanian champions for the past four seasons, Skënderbeu announced the signing of Progni from FK Kukësi on a one-year contract. He was considered to be the replacement of Gjergji Muzaka who had left the club in favour of a return to one of Progni's former sides, Flamurtari.

On 5 August 2015, in the returning match of the Third qualifying round of 2015–16 UEFA Champions League against Milsami Orhei, Progni scored the second goal of the match in the 55th minute to help the team to win the match at Elbasan Arena 2–0 and to qualify in Play-off round with the aggregate 4–0.

On 23 June 2016, Progni moved for the first time aboard by signing a two-year contract with Zira FK of Azerbaijan Premier League. Six months later, Progni left Zira by mutual consent on 9 January 2017.

On 23 January 2017, Progni returned to Albanian Superliga by signing a six-month contract with Teuta, taking the squad number 77. In an interview two days later, he cited that he returned in Albania to stay closer to his family. He made his debut later on 29 January against Tirana at home, contributing in a 1–0 win in the team's first competitive match of 2017.

During the second part of 2016–17 season, Progni contributed with 15 league matches, scoring 2 times, including the winner against Vllaznia in the penultimate matchday which assured Teuta another season in the top flight. He also played 4 matches and scored once in team's unsuccessful run in Albanian Cup, which ended at the hands of Skënderbeu. Following the end of the season, Progni's contract expired and he became a free agent.

On 14 June 2017, Progni completed a transfer to Partizani, returning to his first club after nine years. He was presented the same day where he penned a two-year contract with an option of a further one and was allocated squad number 77, the same he held during his last season with Teuta.

Progni started the domestic season on 10 September by playing full-90 minutes in the opening championship match versus Laçi, ended in a 0–2 loss. Progni was given a new role under Italian manager Mark Iuliano, playing as a right-back in the 4–3–3 lineup. Progni's first score-sheet contributions came later on 20 November by netting the second of the 2–1 win at Kukësi. The first win after three defeats in a row.

In January 2018, Progni switched from number from 77 to his favourite 7, last worn by the departed Realdo Fili. He wore the number 7 on 31 January in the cup match versus Flamurtari. Progni finished the 2017–18 season as Partizani top scorer with 9 goals, including 8 in league, his highest tally since the 2011–12 season.

In July 2018, he played in both matches of 2018–19 UEFA Europa League first qualifying round against NK Maribor, unable to avoid the elimination. Progni left the club in a surprise move on 30 August after having collected 43 matches and scoring 9 goals in all competitions. Partizani Tirana terminated the player's contract by mutual consent due to being more focused on youngster players, while Progni's place in the starting lineup was not secure after collecting only 86 minutes in the first two league matches. Manager Skënder Gega, speaking on Progni's departure, stated that the player was in his plans, but he [Progni] left with the aim of a new challenge.

On 31 August 2018, Progni was presented as Teuta s' newest player, signing a contract until the end of the season and taking squad number 11.

On 26 July 2019, Progni joined SC Gjilani.

Progni has presented Albania at youth level, making 3 appearances for under-19 side and 10 for under-21.

David Meyler

David John Meyler (born 29 May 1989) is an Irish former professional footballer who played as a midfielder, most recently for Reading, and the Republic of Ireland national team.

After turning professional at League of Ireland team Cork City, Meyler moved to Sunderland in the Premier League in 2008. He joined Hull in January 2013 after a short loan spell. He has been a full international for the Republic of Ireland since 2012.

Meyler was born in Cork, Ireland, to Stella Bowles (medical laboratory technician) and John Meyler (GAA dual player and manager).

He progressed through the youth team of Cork City and signed a professional contract in 2008. He made three appearances for Cork, with his debut coming in a cup game against Limerick on 6 June 2008.

Meyler joined Sunderland on 25 July 2008 for an undisclosed fee believed to be around £250,000 which has risen close to £500,000 after appearances and his first Republic of Ireland senior call-up. He became their third summer signing and followed the footsteps of former Cork City teammate Roy O'Donovan by moving to the Stadium of Light. However, it was not until a year and a half after joining Sunderland that Meyler made his first professional appearance for the club, starting against Blackburn Rovers on 28 December 2009. In his third appearance for Sunderland, at Portsmouth on 9 February 2010, Meyler received a straight red card just minutes after coming on as a second-half substitute. He suffered serious cruciate ligament damage against Manchester United on 2 May 2010, that was feared would leave him sidelined for as long as 12 months.
However, he made a quicker recovery than expected, making his comeback for Sunderland's Reserves against Liverpool Reserves, on 2 November 2010. Manager Steve Bruce insisted Meyler would not be rushed back to first team action. Surprisingly, he returned in an away match at Fulham, featuring for 52 minutes in a 0–0 draw. On 5 January 2011, Meyler pulled up suddenly and was stretchered off in Sunderland's away match at Aston Villa. It was revealed after the game by Bruce that Meyler suffered cruciate ligament damage to the same knee as before. It was later announced by Sunderland that Meyler had a scan on the knee and had torn his medial ligament. This ruled Meyler out for another 10 weeks at least rather than 6 months which was first feared. Meyler returned to the Sunderland bench for their defeat at Birmingham City on 16 April 2011.

Meyler continued to be eased back to fitness by Sunderland in the 2011–12 season, playing in several reserve fixtures before making a cameo substitute appearance in the 2–2 draw with West Bromwich Albion on 1 October 2011. He also came on as a late substitute against Aston Villa and Manchester United. Meyler's first appearance under Martin O'Neill came as a 63rd-minute substitute in the 4–1 win at Wigan Athletic on 3 January 2012. Meyler made his first start of the season at Stoke City on 4 February, and was involved in controversy when Robert Huth received a straight red card for a challenge on him. Sunderland went on to win 1–0, and Stoke manager Tony Pulis was unhappy with Meyler's reaction: "I think Robert commits himself them pulls out, and I don't think he actually touches Meyler, or whatever his name is, and I'm really disappointed at the player's reaction... I don't think Robert actually touches the lad, and the way he goes down and rolls around, for me he's done it for one reason and that was to get him sent off." Meyler did not start another game for the rest of the season, although he frequently appeared as a substitute.

On 8 November 2012, Meyler was reunited with former manager Steve Bruce as he went out on loan to Hull City until 1 January 2013.
He made his debut from the bench as a second-half substitute for Jay Simpson in the away match at Cardiff City on 10 November 2012. He scored his first goal for the club on 8 December 2012 when he opened the scoring in the 1–2 win against Watford at Vicarage Road. He scored again in the following game on 15 December, completing a 2–0 win at home to Huddersfield Town. On 8 January 2013, Meyler was signed by Hull permanently on a three-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee.

On 1 December 2013, Meyler scored his first Premier League goal against Liverpool in a 3–1 home win. Meyler was involved in a touchline scuffle on 1 March 2014 with Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew, who headbutted him. Eight days later, after scoring in a 3–0 FA Cup quarter-final win against former team Sunderland, Meyler headbutted the corner flag to mock the incident.

On 13 April 2014, he scored Hull's fifth goal in their 5–3 FA Cup semi-final victory against Sheffield United at Wembley Stadium. On 17 May 2014, he started in the 2014 FA Cup Final against Arsenal.

On 22 January 2016, Meyler signed a two-year extension to his contract with Hull City.

He was released by Hull at the end of the 2017–18 season.

On 5 June 2018, Reading announced the signing of Meyler on a two-year contract, with the option of a third, with the deal to be completed upon the conclusion of his Hull City contract on 30 June 2018.

On 31 January 2019, Meyler joined Coventry City on loan until the end of the 2018–19 season.

On 31 July 2019, Meyler left Reading after his contract was terminated by mutual consent.

On 30 August 2019, Meyler announced his retirement from professional football.

Meyler made his international debut in Cork for the Republic of Ireland U21 team in a 1–1 draw against Germany in February 2009. He had been selected for the Republic of Ireland senior squad when his first knee injury struck, forcing him to withdraw.

On 1 September 2012, Meyler was called up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad. He had been called up to the squad as a replacement for Darron Gibson who took a break from international football following Ireland's disappointing Euro 2012 campaign. He made his senior international debut in a 4–1 win over Oman at Craven Cottage on 11 September 2012.

Derek Townsley

Derek Johnstone Townsley (born 21 January 1973, in Carlisle) is an English former professional footballer. His clubs included Gretna, Queen of the South, Motherwell, Hibernian and Oxford United. Townsley was normally a midfielder, although he was a versatile player and also played in attack and defence.

Prior to being a fully professional footballer, Townsley worked as a postman. While in his first spell with Gretna, who were a Northern Premier League club at the time, he played in the FA Cup 1st round match against the First Division side Bolton. Townsley scored in the match but Gretna lost 3–2.

He began his senior career in 1996 when he joined Dumfries side Queen of the South, with chairman Norman Blount getting the wheels moving on the club's revival. Townsley's creative talents made him a mainstay of the team as the club were rebuilding in the late 1990s. Including an early career appearance for Jamie McAllister, the club reached the Scottish Challenge Cup final for the first time in 1997. Second Division Queens lost 1–0 to First Division side Falkirk at Fir Park. Townsley had a late chance to score an equaliser teed up by man of the match Tommy Bryce. Townsley's shot went over the bar.

Townsley moved into full-time football for the first time at the age of 26 when he joined Motherwell on 31 May 1999.

He was then signed by Hibernian manager Alex McLeish in July 2001 after his contract with Motherwell expired. Townsley struggled to hold down a place under the management of McLeish, but he got into the team more regularly after Bobby Williamson was appointed manager in February 2002. Townsley also popped up with a few goals, including one in a remarkable Edinburgh derby that finished 4–4. Townsley left Hibs at the end of his contract to sign for Oxford United.

Townsley only stayed with Oxford for six months before returning to Gretna.

Yiannis Andrianopoulos

Yiannis Andrianopoulos (Greek: Γιάννης Ανδριανόπουλος; 1900 – 6 November 1952) was a Greek Football Legend and one of the founding members of Greece's most successful football club, Olympiacos CFP.

Born in Piraeus, Greece, Yiannis began his career at the age of 18, playing for home town club Peiraikos Syndesmos FC. Here Yiannis earned his first taste of success, winning an unofficial Greek Championship in 1923. Peiraikos Syndesmos FC merged with Peiraiki Enosis FC in January 1924 and the Athletic and Football Club of Piraeus was formed. Yiannis was part of the new team and helped them win the 1924 Athens-Piraeus championship.

The same year around autumn, the new club split in two different squads: One team, led by the Andrianopoulos brothers and goalkeeper Kostas Klidouchakis, formed Olympiakos Omilos, which evolved into Olympiakos FC; the other, led by Kostas Ferlemis, Christos Peppas and Giorgos Hadjiandreou merged, with an independent club named "Young Boys" to form Peiraikos Omilos, which in turn evolved into Ethnikos Peiraios FC.

Following a series of mergers between other Piraeus and Athens based clubs, as well as an Athens football Championship, Yiannis and his brothers went on to create Olympiacos FC in March 1925. Yiannis, Giorgios, Dinos and Vasilis, Leonidas went on to make the newly formed Piraeus Club famous throughout Greece. Two other brothers, Aristides and Stelios Andrianopoulos, were playing in other Piraeus football clubs.

Yiannis was the oldest of seven brothers who, like him, would go on to become famous footballers in the Olympiacos' ranks. As a result, Yiannis and his brothers earned Olympiacos the name "Thrylos" meaning "Legend" in Greek, a nickname which the club carries to this day. Yiannis was certainly the brother who made the biggest impact towards the club, even becoming a player-coach; Olympiacos' first coach, from 1925 until 1927. In 1929, Yiannis retired from football, and became Olympiacos' president for 3 years.

Yiannis played for the national side for the 1920 Olympic Games His brother Giorgos was a member of the team too.
His brothers at Olympiakos also played for Greece in 1929 and 1930.

Arnór Smárason

Arnór Smárason (born 7 September 1988) is an Icelandic footballer who plays for Norwegian Eliteserien side Lillestrøm. He can play in all the positions on the midfield.

Arnór was born in Akranes, Iceland, and is a cousin of Pétur Pétursson. He started his football career at the local club ÍA Akranes, before moving to Norway at age 15 together with his family. He played a year with Molde FK as his father was attending Molde University College, before returning to Iceland. A year later, Arnór moved to the Netherlands to join up with the youth teams of SC Heerenveen, following a successful trial.

Arnór signed his first professional contract with Hereenveen on 9 September 2007, aged 19. He made his senior debut the same season, during the spring of 2008, whilst also signing a new three-year deal with the Eredivisie side.

During the following season, in 2008–09, Arnór became a regular starter for Heerenveen. He made his continental debut for the club in the Europa League on 18 September 2008, coming on as a late sub in a 1–1 draw against the Portuguese side Vitória. Nearly a month later, on 19 October 2008, Arnór scored his first competitive goal for the club in a 2–2 draw against Roda. That season Heerenveen finished 5th in the Eredivisie and went all the way to the final in the KNVB Cup. They eventually won against Twente, 2–2 after full-time and 5–4 on penalties, though Arnór remained on the bench as an unused sub. In all, Arnór played 27 games for Hereenveen during the season and scored 5 goals.

Due to a serious back injury, Arnór missed most of the 2009–10 league play. He was sent to the clinic of Bayern Munich club doctor Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt, who treated him during the spring of 2010. He returned to the pitch in March the same year, playing two competitive games throughout the season. At the same time, Heerenveen communicated that Arnór would leave the club as a free transfer the upcoming summer, due to the club's financial difficulties.

In June 2010, he moved to Esbjerg fB in Denmark. Arnór signed a three year-deal with the Superliga club. He went straight into Esbjerg's first team and played his first game in the opening round of the 2010-11 season, a 0–3 loss against Odense. He scored his first goal for the club on 28 August 2010 against Silkeborg, in a 2–1 win. He went on to play 24 of Esbjerg's 33 games in the league, when the team disappointingly finished at the foot of the table and was relegated to the 1st Division.

Esbjerg made a quick return to the Danish top tier. With six rounds left of the 2011–12 Danish 1st Division, they were crowned champions and had already won their promotion. Arnór played 19 games for his side throughout the season, being used as a rotation player, scoring 5 goals.

Arnór started his first game of the 2012–13 season in the third round against SønderjyskE, where he scored in 1–3 loss. In the same game, Arnór attracted a knee injury that kept him sidelined during the fall of 2012. He made his come back on 8 November in a Danish Cup fixture against Aalborg, 0–0 after full-time and 4–2 on penalties, where Arnór slotted home his kick from the spot. After a tough winter with limited playing time, Arnór broke into the starting eleven during the end of the campaign, starting in Esbjerg's last 7 games of the season, in which he scored 5 goals. On 9 May 2013, Esbjerg won the Danish Cup following a 1–0 victory against Randers in the final. Arnór was picked in the starting eleven and was subbed off during extra time. During the summer of 2013, he parted ways with Esbjerg at the end of his contract, on mutual consent.

In July 2013, Arnór moved to Helsingborgs IF in Sweden on a three and a half-year deal. He was sought out as a replacement for Alejandro Bedoya, who had recently been sold to the French club Nantes. At the time of his arrival, midway through the 2013 season, Helsingborg was situated 2nd in the Allsvenskan table. Arnór made his debut for the side on 15 July, in a 3–0 win against Östers IF. His first goal for the club came only weeks later, on 5 August, in a 1–2 away loss against Djurgårdens IF. Eventually, Helsingborg dropped off from the top positions and finished 5th in Allsvenskan. Arnór played 14 competitive games during the season, scoring 4 goals.

During the 2014 Allsvenskan, Arnór played 27 out of 30 games in the league, scoring 3 goals. In addition, he had a successful run in the Svenska Cupen, scoring 2 goals in 6 fixtures as Helsingborg made it all the way to the final. On 18 May 2014, his side lost the final against Elfsborg with a score of 0–1.

Ahead of the 2015 season, with two years left on his contract, Arnór was loaned to FC Torpedo Moscow in the Russian Football Premier League. In his debut on 15 March 2015 against Zenit Saint Petersburg, he scored an added-time scissor kick to equalise for his team in a 1–1 draw. In May 2015, the whole Torpedo squad went on strike due to their wages being unpaid since the start of the year. The team was then situated at the foot of the league. In all, Arnór played 11 games during his six month-loan spell at Torpedo, scoring 2 goals.

In the summer of 2015, Arnór returned to Helsingborg, only to be deemed surplus to requirements (due to his reported high salary) by then manager Henrik Larsson. Due to injuries in the squad, however, Arnór returned to the starting eleven and scored a long-range strike in a 3–1 win against AIK on 19 July 2015. He kept his place in the team throughout the rest of the season, scoring 5 goals in 14 matches and becoming Helsingborg's second best top scorer in the league.

On 10 December 2015, he signed for the Stockholm-based club Hammarby IF on a three-year deal. He reportedly moved on a free transfer, even though he had one year left on his contract with Helsingborg. He made his debut for Hammarby on 26 February 2016, in a 0–0 draw against Syrianska FC in the Svenska Cupen. A month later, Arnór scored a spectacular volley against fierce rivals AIK in the quarter final of the Svenska Cupen. Hammarby won the game on penalties after goalkeeper Ögmundur Kristinsson, a fellow countryman of Arnór, scored the decisive kick. During his first league season at the club, Arnór quickly established himself as a regular starter, making 27 appearances and scoring 4 goals.

At the beginning of 2017, under the reign of new manager Jakob Michelsen, Arnór Smárason was appointed as the new vice captain at Hammarby. He remained a starter for the team during the season, scoring 5 goals in 29 league games. However, in 2018 he was used sparingly by Hammarby and left the club on 27 July, signing with Lillestrøm SK in Eliteserien.

Arnór Smárason was first called up to the Iceland U21s in 2007, making 10 appearances while scoring twice during the next four years.

He made his debut in the senior national team in a friendly against Wales on 21 May 2008, in a 0–1 loss. Arnór scored his first international goal for his country in a 2–0 friendly win against Liechtenstein on 11 February 2009.

Iceland qualified for their first major tournament, the UEFA Euro in France, in 2016. Arnór was, however, not called up to the squad by manager Lars Lagerbäck.

Chen Zhizhao

Chen Zhizhao ; born 14 March 1988), known as Zizao in Brazil, is a Chinese footballer who currently plays for Guangzhou R&F in the Chinese Super League.

Chen Zhizhao started his football career playing for Shanghai Shenhua's youth academy; however, he was unable to break into their first team. He then transferred to Hong Kong First Division League side Citizen AA at the beginning of the 2007-08 league season where he would make his debut for the club against Lanwa Redbull in the first game of the season in a 0-0 draw. He quickly established himself within the team and would play in 13 league games and see Citizen come second within the league. Throughout the season he would also play in all of Citizen's cup games and would score his first goal against Eastern AA on 24 November 2007 in a Hong Kong Senior Shield game that Citizen lose 3-1. His following goals would come in the Hong Kong FA Cup where he scored against Eastern AA on 10 May 2008 in a semifinal game that saw them win 1-0. This was then followed by a goal in the final of the FA Cup win against Wofoo Tai Po on 18 May 2008 that saw Citizen win 2-0.

Chen moved back to mainland China and signed a five-year contract with Nanchang Hengyuan on 26 February 2009. He scored three goals as Nanchang finished second in the China League One and won promotion to the Chinese Super League for the first time. He scored ten goals and assisted eight times in thirty appearances which secured Nanchang's stay in the top flight for the next season.

Chen was linked with Liga de Honra side C.D. Trofense in January 2011. Trofense was interested with Chen, but Nanchang blocked this transfer. According to Chen's contract with the club on 26 February 2009, if a non-Chinese football club provided a bid of around €200,000 for him before 26 February 2011, then Nanchang would accept the transfer without any condition. However, Nanchang insisted that €200,000 was provided by Chen's agency instead of the Portuguese club; besides, in the new contract which signed in early 2010, there were no related contract terms, so they had enough reasons to block this transfer. Chen refused to return to the club after this incident. He didn't make any appearances for the club in the 2011 season and instead played for Panyu Pearl, a futsal team in his hometown.

In February 2012, Chen was loaned to Campeonato Brasileiro Série A side Corinthians until 31 December 2013. He made his debut for Corinthians in a 2–0 defeat against Cruzeiro on 17 October 2012, coming on for Welder at the 80th minute. Chen made his first start for the club on 20 January 2013, assisting the first goal in a 1-1 draw against Paulista. On 11 March 2013, Chen was called up to the Chinese national team by then manager José Antonio Camacho to be a part of the squad that would face Iraq during 2015 AFC Asian Cup qualification. He returned to his parent club Shanghai Shenxin after the 2013 season.

On 28 February 2014, Chen transferred to fellow Chinese Super League side Beijing Guoan. He received a ban of four matches at the beginning of 2014 season by Chinese Football Association for age falsification which he changed his age from 14 March 1988 to 14 March 1989. He made his debut for the club on 24 March 2014 in a 2–0 win against Shanghai Greenland. He scored his first goal for the club on 27 April 2014 in a 1–0 win against Harbin Yiteng.

On 22 December 2015, Chen transferred to his hometown club Guangzhou R&F in the Chinese Super League. On 4 March 2016, he made his debut in a 2–1 home defeat against Hebei China Fortune. He scored his first goal for the club on 21 August 2016 by shooting the winner in the 87th minute against Chongqing Lifan, which gave Guangzhou R&F a 5–4 away win. On 18 June 2017, Chen was involved in a collision during a league match with Shanghai SIPG. Although just being cautioned, he received a ban of 7 matches by the Chinese Football Association.

Mark Mettrick

Mark Mettrick (born October 3, 1964) is an English-American former soccer player who played four seasons as a midfielder in the Major Indoor Soccer League and three in the USISL. He is currently the head coach of Gettysburg College.

Mettrick grew up in Manchester, England, playing in the Manchester United youth system from 1982 to 1984. Mettrick was offered a spot in the Manchester United reserve team, but chose to attend Hartwick College where he was a member of the men's soccer team from 1984 to 1987. During his four seasons with the Hawks, they went to two NCAA Final Fours. He finished his career with forty-six career goals and earned first team All American recognition in 1985 and 1987. Mettrick was inducted into the Hartwick Athletic Hall of Fame on September 20, 1997. He graduated in 1988 with a bachelor's degree in physics. In 1988, the Baltimore Blast of Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) picked Mettrick in the first round of the MISL Draft. He played for the Blast until 1992, the year the MISL folded. During his four seasons with the Blast, the team went to the 1989 and 1990 finals, losing both times. In 1993, Mettrick signed with the expansion Baltimore Bays of the USISL. He was named to the 1993 All Atlantic Division Team. He played for the Bays through at least the 1994–1995 USISL indoor season. In 1997, he played for the Bays during the USISL indoor season.

In 1993, Mount St. Mary's University hired Mettrick as an assistant to the men's soccer team. In 1994, he moved up to the head coaching position. In his six seasons as head coach, he took Mount St. Mary's to a 57–42–12 record.

In 2000, Loyola College in Maryland hired Mettrick as its head soccer coach, replacing the veteran Bill Sento, who had been at the helm for two decades.

Mettrick's first three seasons at the Evergreen were quite successful. In 2000, he took advantage of a team that was largely intact from the 1999 season, adding only Scottish central defender Niall Lepper to the starting lineup, and led Loyola to its first national ranking since 1997. Despite a slow start in 2001 after a loss and a tie in a season-opening tournament in California, Loyola went onto a 19-game unbeaten streak before losing to Saint Louis in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Division I Tournament, relying primarily on the strength of its defense led by Lepper and three-time regional All-America goalkeeper Reb Beatty. Loyola ended the 2001 campaign with a record of 17–2–2, including victories over nationally ranked Maryland (twice), Fairfield, and American, and finished ranked in the Top 10 in the nation. Mettrick was named the NSCAA South Atlantic Region Coach of the Year. Mettrick continued this success into the 2002 season; despite losing six starters, the core of the team in Lepper and Beatty returned and led Mettrick's gang to a 13–5–3 record and another berth in the NCAA Tournament before falling to Furman.

The 2003 season was Mettrick's first with a team based solely on his recruits; from 2000 to 2002, the majority of the starting lineup consisted of players that had been recruited by Bill Sento. Further complicating matters was the loss of Beatty and Lepper – Loyola's two best players – due to graduation. Loyola was able to reach the MAAC Championship game in 2003 but was defeated in the final by Saint Peter's, starting a streak of four consecutive years without an MAAC championship. This streak included losing seasons in both 2005 and 2006.

Under pressure to turn things around, Mettrick took the best pieces of his 2006 team and added several new recruits, leading to an incredible change of fortune. In both 2007 and 2008 he coached the Greyhounds into the NCAA Tournament, reaching the second round both years. In 2008, he was awarded the NSCAA/Adidas Coach of the Year award for the North Atlantic Region after leading the team to an undefeated regular season in the MAAC. The Greyhounds reached the NCAA College Cup for a school Division I record third-straight season in 2009. Loyola then finished with a 9–7–2 record in 2010. Mettrick was relieved of his duties on November 12, 2013.

Mauro Formica

Mauro Abel Formica (born 4 April 1988) is an Argentine footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Newell's Old Boys in the Argentine Primera División. 
He is nicknamed "El Gato" ("The Cat").

Having signed a professional contract, Formica made his professional debut for Newell's Old Boys on 29 September 2006 at the age of 18, in a match against Club Atlético Colón, as the teams drew 1–1. After two-years since professional at Newell's Old Boys, Formica soon established himself in the first team in 2008–09 and in Torneo Apertura on 13 December 2008, Formica scored his first goal in a 3–0 win over Racing Club. Soon after, on the opening game of the season, Formica scored his first goal (and scored another) and set up a goal for Leandro Armani in a 3–0 win over Gimnasia. Soon in mid-May, Formica scored three goals in three consecutive games, against River Plate, Arsenal de Sarandí and Rosario Central. After the end of the season, Formica made sixteen appearance (having missed four appearance due to slight injury) and scoring seven.

The following season, Formica continued to retain his first team and in Torneo Inicial, Formica scored four goals in nineteen appearance. Shortly after the end of Torneo Inicial, Formica played his first game of Copa Libertadores in a 0–0 draw against Emelec in the first leg but the club was eliminated in the second leg, with a 2–1 score for Emelec. On the final game of the season of Torneo Final, Formica scored twice and set up a goal for Lucas Bernardi in a 6–1 win over Gimnasia, the team which he scored his first goal.

His good performance attracted attention from Europe with the likes of Ajax, AS Monaco, Galatasaray and Arsenal. Russian side Rubin Kazan made a bid for Formica but the offer was rejected. Soon after rival River Plate tried to sign him but the offer was also rejected.

Though rebuffing offers from Europe, Formica playing time was reduced under new manager Roberto Sensini. Though fallen out, Formica continued his form in Copa Sudamericana, scoring three goals, against Estudiantes and a brace against Club San Jose.

After leaving Newell's Old Boys, Formica played a total of 84 games scoring 22 goals for the club over 5 years. While at Newell's Old Boys, Formica is known for his technique, dribbling and speed. He is also known for his great shot from half-distance.

On the last day of the transfer window, Formica signed for Blackburn Rovers – on a four-year deal – reported to be worth around £4 million. Then-manager Steve Kean described Formica as a young Gabriel Batistuta, believing he's best prospects in Argentine football. However, Formica did not break into the squad, appearing instead for Blackburn reserves, often due to a lack of match fitness.

Kean tipped Formica as a future star going into his second season with Rovers, and on 13 August 2011, Formica scored on his Premier League debut for Rovers against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a 2–1 defeat at Ewood Park. On 20 August 2011, he came on for Jason Roberts on 75 minutes in a 3–1 defeat against Aston Villa at Villa Park. Four days later, Formica started and played the full 90 minutes in a 3–1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday at Ewood Park in the second round of the League Cup. On 27 August 2011, Formica won two penalties in a home league game against Everton. He missed one and so did Junior Hoilett, the match ended with Everton winning 1–0. In the January transfer window, Formica was expected to leave Blackburn, having been named one of Blackburn's player to leave the club, reportedly for personal reasons. Several days later, Formica revealed the club rejected a move back to his former club, with Blackburn want to sell for €5million. In mid-January, Formica was also linked with a move to Greek side Olympiacos, where he would join his brother, playing for a different Greek club. His brother told Sport24 that Mauro want to leave Blackburn, insisting the talk is ongoing However, the move to Greece fell through, as the club were unable to meet Blackburn's asking price. Later in the season, Formica would score three more goals against Tottenham Hotspur, Fulham and Norwich City. However, at the end of the season, Blackburn were relegated to the Championship.

Formica was in and out of the first team, due to change of management. On 17 November 2012, Formica scored his first goal of the season in a 4–1 win over Peterborough United and several weeks on, Formica made his last appearance in a 4–1 loss against Cardiff City. Formica hadn't played since throughout December and January, due to injury on the knee.

On 23 January 2013, Serie A strugglers Palermo announced on their website to have signed Formica on loan until the end of the season, with an option to make the move permanent during the period of the loan spell. He made his debut four days later, as a second-half substitute for Josip Iličić in a 1–1 draw at Cagliari. In the next match in a 2–1 loss against Atalanta, Formica provided assist for Nélson Marcos from a cross, with Nélson scoring from a backheel.

On 13 August 2013, Cruz Azul announced on their website that they had signed Mauro Formica.

Formica played his first cap, coming on for Ariel Cabral, in a 2–1 loss against Poland on 5 June 2011.

Mauro is the younger brother of fellow professional player Lautaro Formica.

Thomas Müller

Thomas Müller (; born 13 September 1989) is a German professional footballer who plays for and vice-captains Bayern Munich, and has made 100 appearances for the German national team. A versatile player, Müller plays as a midfielder or forward, and has been deployed in a variety of attacking roles – as an attacking midfielder, second striker, centre forward and on either wing. He has been praised for his positioning, teamwork and stamina, work-rate, and has shown consistency in both scoring and creating goals.

A product of Bayern's youth system, he made his first-team breakthrough in the 2009–10 season after Louis van Gaal was appointed as the main coach; he played almost every game as the club won the league and cup double and reached the Champions League final. Müller scored 23 goals in the 2012–13 season as Bayern won a historic treble; the league title, cup and Champions League.

Müller earned a call-up to the German national team in 2010. At the 2010 World Cup he scored five goals in six appearances as Germany finished in third place. He was named the Best Young Player of the tournament and won the Golden Boot as the tournament's top scorer, with five goals and three assists. At the 2014 World Cup he played a major role in helping the team win the trophy, scoring five goals and receiving the Silver Ball as the tournament's second top player and the Silver Boot as the second top goalscorer, and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI and in the Dream Team.

In 2014, Müller was ranked the fifth-best footballer in the world by "The Guardian".

Born in Weilheim, Müller played as a youth for TSV Pähl, and at the age of 10 he made the journey to join local Bundesliga side Bayern Munich in 2000. He progressed through the youth system and was part of the team that finished runner-up in the Under 19 Bundesliga in 2007. He made his debut for the reserve team in March 2008 when he replaced Stephan Fürstner in a Regionalliga match against SpVgg Unterhaching, in which he scored. He made two more Regionalliga appearances in the 2007–08 season, while continuing to play for the under-19 team. The following season, Bayern's second string qualified for the newly formed 3. Liga, and Müller established himself as a key player – he played in 32 out of 38 matches and scored 15 times<ref name="Spieler-Statistik 2008/09"></ref> to make him the league's fifth top scorer. He also became involved in the first-team under then manager Jürgen Klinsmann; he appeared in pre-season friendlies, and made his full debut on 15 August 2008, when he came on as a substitute for Miroslav Klose for the last ten minutes of a Bundesliga match against Hamburger SV. Despite Müller feeling that his performance did not go well, he made three more Bundesliga appearances that season and made his Champions League debut on 10 March 2009 when he was substituted on in the 72nd minute for Bastian Schweinsteiger in a 7–1 win over Sporting CP. He scored Bayern's last goal as they won the tie 12–1 on aggregate.

In February 2009, Müller signed his first contract for the senior team, a two-year deal effective from the 2009–10 season, along with reserve teammate Holger Badstuber.

Müller was prepared to be loaned or even transferred away to find first-team football, but when Louis van Gaal was appointed manager, both Müller and Badstuber became fixtures in the Bayern first team from the start of the season. In the first few matches, Müller was a regular substitute, and on 12 September 2009, he was brought on against Borussia Dortmund and scored two goals in a 5–1 victory. Three days later, he scored another brace in a 3–0 Champions League victory over Maccabi Haifa. He rounded off September by being named the Bundesliga Player of the Month and earned praise from his namesake, legendary former Bayern and Germany striker Gerd Müller. After the Haifa match, Müller was in the starting XI for almost every match, only missing one match, a Champions League match against Bordeaux, for which he was suspended, because he was sent off in an earlier match against the same team.

In February 2010, Müller signed a new contract with Bayern Munich through 2013. During the second half of the season, Müller continued to be a regular first-team starter, usually playing in a central striking role due to the availability of other wide players Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben. In April 2010, he scored the second goal in a 2–1 win against title rivals Schalke 04, and in the penultimate league match of the season, he scored the first hat-trick of his career, in a 3–1 win over VfL Bochum which effectively secured the German title for Bayern. The title was confirmed a week later with a 3–1 win at Hertha BSC, a match which Müller started.

For the season, he played in all 34 Bundesliga matches, starting 29, and recorded 13 goals and 11 assists. Bayern and Müller were back in Berlin the following week, to face Werder Bremen in the final of the DFB-Pokal. Müller started the match and Bayern won 4–0 to complete the domestic double. Müller scored four goals and made two assists during the competition, which made him its leading scorer for the season. Bayern's season ended in pursuit of a first treble, in the 2010 Champions League Final against Inter Milan at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. It was not to be, however, as they lost 2–0, with both goals coming from Diego Milito. Müller was in the starting line-up and had a key chance just after half-time, with Bayern 1–0 down, but his shot was saved by Júlio César. Müller felt particularly disappointed by this defeat, but he ended his first season as a first-team player with 52 matches played and 19 goals in all competitions.

In a poll conducted by the sports magazine "kicker", he was voted by his fellow professionals as the best newcomer of the 2009–10 season and was named in the Bundesliga Team of the Season. Müller credits Van Gaal for having had the biggest part to play in his rise to success – the coach arrived with a reputation for promoting youth team players, particularly at Ajax, and consistently gave Müller his chance in the first-team, going as far to say ""Müller spielt bei mir immer"" ("with me, Müller will always play"). Müller, in return, described Van Gaal as "a genius technician" who makes players "improve every time".

Müller returned from his post-World Cup break to sign another contract extension, this time extending his stay at Bayern until 2015. As with all of Bayern's World Cup participants, he missed much of pre-season, and his first match back was the Supercup against Schalke 04 on 7 August. He was named in the starting 11, and scored the opening goal in a 2–0 win. Two weeks later he scored the opening goal of Bayern's league season in a 2–1 home win against VfL Wolfsburg. Müller played in every match of the first half of the season, usually as a starter, but as the team struggled for results, Müller was unable to match the previous season's goalscoring exploits, being dropped to the bench, and even receiving a telling off from Louis van Gaal after missing an easy chance in a 2–0 defeat against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in August. He was philosophical about this dip in form, though, and after eight league games without a goal, he scored in a 4–1 win against Eintracht Frankfurt on 27 November; He followed that by scoring in consecutive league and cup wins against VfB Stuttgart three weeks later. These goals took his tally to eight goals in all competitions and included a spectacular goal to open the scoring in a 2–0 Champions League victory against Roma on 15 September.

As his team was on its winter break, Müller was left to reflect on what he described as "an almost unbelievable first year as a pro". Müller began the second half of the season in good form, but was involved in an altercation with teammate Arjen Robben, who was angered when Müller showed his displeasure at a poor free-kick Robben took during a 3–1 win at Werder Bremen. Müller again played in every game of the season and scored 19 goals (12 in the league), but the season was less successful for Bayern, as they finished third in the league, and were knocked out of the DFB-Pokal in the semi-finals by Schalke 04 and in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League by Inter Milan; Bayern had won 1–0 at the San Siro, and Müller scored 31 minutes into the second leg to make it 3–1 on aggregate, but Inter levelled the score at 3–3 in the 88th minute to go through on the away goals rule. Müller's mentor Van Gaal was increasingly criticised for inflexibility in tactical, transfer and selection policy, and ultimately lost his job, being replaced with Jupp Heynckes.

In Bayern's first DFB-Pokal game Müller was awarded the man of the match after earning two penalties which were converted by Mario Gómez and Bastian Schweinsteiger, Müller then added a third in the closing stages to secure a 3–0 victory over Eintracht Braunschweig. It took Müller five matches for him to get his first league goal; he scored it against Schalke 04 in Bayern's 2–0 win. Müller then scored in Bayern's next home game in the early stages of the match, which they went on to win, 3–0. On 26 November 2011, Müller netted the opener on the half-hour in Bayern's 6–0 thrashing of FC Ingolstadt, giving him his second DFB-Pokal goal. Müller was on the short-list of this year's FIFA Ballon d'Or award. On 10 and 15 January, in Bayern's warm up friendlies, Müller scored three goals in two games, a brace against the India national team (which Bayern then went on to win 4–0) and one goal in Bayern's other 4–0 victory over Rot-Weiß Erfurt. Müller provided two assists in Bayern's win over VfB Stuttgart in the DFB-Pokal. On 11 February, Bayern played 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Müller ended a goal drought lasting since 24 September 2011 with a header in their 2–0 victory. On 31 March 2012, Müller played his 100th Bundesliga game against 1. FC Nürnberg. On 19 May 2012, Müller scored the opening goal in the Champions League final against Chelsea with a powerful header. He was substituted shortly afterwards. Bayern Munich, however, lost the final on penalties. Müller stated how dissatisfied he was about the amount of time he had spent on the bench recently. Müller said that although he was dissatisfied he wanted to stay at Bayern. During the season, Müller scored seven goals in 34 league matches, two goals in five German Cup matches, and two goals in 14 Champions League matches.

Müller's first Bundesliga goal of the season came over 2. Bundesliga champions SpVgg Greuther Fürth in Bayern's 3–0 victory on 27 August 2012. On 2 September, he netted a brace as Bayern thrashed southern rivals VfB Stuttgart, 6–1, in front of 71,000 at the newly expanded Allianz Arena. Müller helped Bayern achieve a record-breaking start to the league season, when he netted a brace over newly promoted Fortuna Düsseldorf on 20 October in their 5–0 victory, recording Bayern's eighth successive win. Three days later, he scored his first Champions League goal of the season, netting from the penalty spot, as Bayern defeated Lille 1–0 at the French side's newly built Grand Stade Lille Métropole.

On 13 December, after his good run of form in the first half of the Bundesliga season, Müller pledged his allegiance claiming he was at home in Munich and that, "There is no club to step up from when you leave FC Bayern... there almost is no better club." Six days later, he signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him at the Allianz Arena until 2017. At the winter break in the Bundesliga, he had nine goals and seven assists in 16 league appearances and a further three goals in the Champions League; this gave him a total of 13 goals halfway through the season, including his strike against Borussia Dortmund in Bayern's win in the 2012 DFL-Supercup. Müller scored his first goal in Bayern's second game back from the break in a 2–0 away win over VfB Stuttgart. Müller tapped in his fifth goal of the Champions League campaign on 2 April, completing a 2–0 first leg defeat of Juventus in the quarter-finals, ending the Italian club's 18-match unbeaten record in Europe. On 23 April 2013, Müller scored two goals and gave one assist in 4–0 win against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final in the Allianz Arena. On the return fixture, Müller scored a header as Bayern won 3–0 and gave Barcelona their biggest defeat ever in the Champions League, with a 7–0 aggregate score. Müller then went on to play an important role in Bayern's 2–1 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the final. On 1 June, Müller scored a penalty in the final of the 2012–13 DFB-Pokal. Bayern won the cup 3–2 to complete an historic treble. Müller scored 23 goals overall in the season (including all competitions), netting 13 in the Bundesliga, one in the Pokal, and an impressive eight in the Champions League, he also added one in the 2012 DFL-Supercup which Bayern won 2–1. This topped off Müller's highest scoring season to date.

Müller began the 2013–14 season by playing in the German Super Cup. by scoring in seven of Bayern's 12 pre-season games. His first competitive match came against Borussia Dortmund in the German Super Cup. On 5 August, Müller scored a hat-trick as Bayern won 5–0 in the team's 2013–14 DFB-Pokal first-round game against Schwarz-Weiß Rehden. In Bayern's opening 2013–14 Bundesliga fixture, Müller missed a penalty for the first time. Seconds later, the save from the penalty flicked the hand of Álvaro Domínguez which resulted in another penalty which David Alaba converted. After this, Müller stated, "I am still happy to take penalties, but I think David Alaba is the main man for spot kicks for now." He played in the UEFA Super Cup. On 25 September, against Hannover 96 in the second round of the DFB-Pokal, Müller scored twice taking his cup tally to five goals in just two games. On 28 September, Müller scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over VfL Wolfsburg, giving him his first goal in the 2013–14 Bundesliga.

On 3 May 2016, Müller had a penalty kick saved by Jan Oblak in the Champions League semi-final second leg at home to Atlético Madrid. The match ended in a 2–1 win for Bayern but the team was knocked out on the away goals rule.

He finished the season by scoring 20 goals in 31 league matches, four goals in five German Cup matches, and eight goals in 12 Champions League matches. He didn't score in the German Super Cup.

Müller started the season by winning and scoring in the 2016 German Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund on 14 August 2016. In the league, Müller did not score for 999 minutes until he scored during a home game against VfL Wolfsburg in the 76th minute. He finished the 2016–17 season by scoring five goals in 29 Bundesliga appearances, no goals in three German Cup appearances, and three goals in nine Champions League appearances. Müller did have a career best 12 assists in the Bundesliga.

Several German football experts like Lothar Matthäus blamed manager Carlo Ancelotti for Müller's struggles in front of the goal. Ancelotti often preferred Thiago Alcântara as the player playing behind the striker, Müller's prime position. Müller was often benched for the important matches in Europe and in the Bundesliga.

Müller started the 2017–18 season by playing in the 2017 German Super Cup. He played in the opening 67 minutes before being replaced by Kingsley Coman. His first goal of the season was against Mainz on matchday four of the Bundesliga. On 21 January 2018, he scored two goals against Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga. On 20 February 2018, Müller scored two goals against Beşiktaş in Champions League.

Müller led the Bundesliga with 14 assists. Müller also scored 8 goals in 29 league matches.

Müller started the 2018–19 season by starting in the German Super Cup. Müller scored in the first two matchdays in the Bundesliga season. He scored in the second round of the German Cup against SV Rödinghausen. He scored two goals against Fortuna Düsseldorf in the Bundesliga on 24 November 2018. On 12 December 2018, Müller played his 105th Champions League match in a match against Ajax and therefore leveling former club legend Philipp Lahm as the record appearance holder in the Champions League at Bayern. In that same match Müller was sent off for the first time in his career for a straight red card. This resulted in a two-match suspension. On 15 December 2018, Müller made his 300th Bundesliga appearance for Bayern against Hannover 96.

On 18 May 2019, Müller won his seventh consecutive Bundesliga title as Bayern finished two points above Dortmund with 78 points. It was Müller's eighth Bundesliga title. A week later, Müller won his fifth DFB-Pokal as Bayern defeated RB Leipzig 3-0 in the 2019 DFB-Pokal Final.

On 2 November 2019, Müller made his 500th competitive appearance for Bayern, becoming the 10th Bayern player to reach this mark since the club's promotion to the Bundesliga in 1965. The following month, he became the first-ever player to register 11 assists in the first half of a Bundesliga, achieving the new record in his side's 2–0 win over Wolfsburg.

Müller represented Germany at various youth levels, starting with the under-16s in 2004. In August 2009, he was called up to the under-21 team for his debut in a 3–1 friendly defeat against Turkey. He earned six caps for the under-21s and scored one goal, the eighth in an 11–0 thrashing of San Marino.

In October of the same year, Müller's regular appearances for Bayern's first team caused Germany national team manager Joachim Löw to publicly consider him for a call-up, despite initial reluctance from the Bayern Munich board; the following month, Müller was named in the squad for a friendly against the Ivory Coast. However, this coincided with the death of national team goalkeeper Robert Enke, which led to the cancellation of a match against Chile the same week. With less opportunity to try out new players, and with the under-21 team facing crucial qualifiers for the 2011 European Championship, Löw and under-21 manager Rainer Adrion felt that Müller was needed at the under-21 level, and Müller was called back into the under-21s.

He was back in the senior squad for its next get-together, a training session in Sindelfingen in January 2010, and was named in the squad for the following match, a friendly against Argentina in March. He made his debut in this game in the starting XI at the Allianz Arena, his home stadium with Bayern. He was substituted in the 66th minute for fellow debutant Toni Kroos as Germany lost 1–0.

Müller was named in Germany's provisional 27-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup along with seven other Bayern Munich players. Despite suffering a scare when he fell off his bicycle at the team's training camp in South Tyrol, Müller only received superficial injuries and made the final cut for the tournament when the squad was reduced to 23 players. He was allocated the number 13, normally worn by injured captain Michael Ballack, and previously worn by Müller's eponym Gerd. He earned his second international cap in the final warm-up match before the World Cup when he came on as a half-time substitute for Piotr Trochowski in a 3–1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina. He started the first game of Germany's World Cup campaign and scored the third goal – his first internationally – in a 4–0 win over Australia, winning Germany's goal of the month award in the process. He played in all Germany's group games, as they finished top of Group D; he scored twice and assisted once in the 4–1 victory over England in the round of 16. In the third minute of Germany's 4–0 quarter final win against Argentina, he opened the scoring with his fourth tournament goal. However, he picked up his second booking of the tournament in the first half, for a handball and was suspended for the semi-final defeat against Spain. Müller said that he felt far more nervous during the Spain game than any he was able to play. He returned to the team for the third-place playoff against Uruguay and scored the first goal, his fifth of the tournament, as Germany won 3–2 to take the bronze medals. The team's success was a culmination of a series of changes made after the national team's failure at Euro 2000. The Germans emphasized a more open, attack-minded style not previously associated with Germany, and included prominent young players, including Müller, Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil.

With five goals Müller ended as joint top goalscorer of the tournament. He earned the Golden Boot with these goals and his three assists. He also won the Best Young Player Award over fellow nominees André Ayew of Ghana and Giovani dos Santos of Mexico. For both awards, he succeeded a German teammate, Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski, respectively, from 2006.

In October 2010, he was named on the shortlist for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award along with four of his Germany teammates. Reflecting on his World Cup success, Müller said "I basically got lucky, I hit form at just the right time".

Müller started all ten of Germany's qualifiers for Euro 2012, as the team qualified for the finals with a 100% record. Müller provided assists for seven goals, three of which came in a 6–2 win over Austria in September 2011 which secured Germany's qualification for the finals with two games to spare. He scored three times in the campaign, two goals coming in a 4–0 win over Kazakhstan in March 2011, the third in a 3–1 win over Turkey in October of the same year.

Müller was included in Joachim Löw's squad for Euro 2012, where the Germans were knocked out in the semi-finals by Italy.

Müller scored his first World Cup qualifying goals on 22 March 2013, scoring Germany's opener and final goal in a 3–0 away win over Kazakhstan. He also scored in the 3–0 victories over Austria and the Faroe Islands to give him four goals in Germany's successful qualification campaign.

On 16 June 2014, in Germany's opening match of the 2014 World Cup, Müller scored the first hat-trick of the tournament and was named man of the match in a 4–0 win against Portugal. In addition, he was also the target of Pepe's headbutt in the 37th minute, which resulted in the Portuguese defender being sent off. He denied that he had "overplayed" the situation leading to the red card. On 26 June, Müller scored the only goal of the final group match against the United States to help the Germans win Group G and dispelled fear of collusion between German coach Joachim Löw and American coach Jürgen Klinsmann to play to a draw as had occurred in 1982.

On 8 July, he scored Germany's opening goal in the 7–1 semi-final defeat of Brazil. This goal was Germany's 2,000th goal in its history. Müller has now scored at least five goals in each of his first two World Cups, making him only the third player to do so (after Teófilo Cubillas and teammate Miroslav Klose). With the goal, he has tied Helmut Rahn with 10 World Cup goals.

On 11 July, Müller was named on the ten-man shortlist for FIFA's Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player. Having played a major role in the team's World Cup triumph, Müller received the Silver Boot as the tournament's second top goalscorer with five goals, and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI.

Müller featured in nine of ten matches during Germany's qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 2016, scoring nine goals as Germany topped their qualifying group to qualify for Euro 2016.

Müller started in all six matches that Germany played at the Euro 2016 finals. In the quarter-final match against Italy, Müller's shot was the first one to be saved in the penalty shoot-out during the tournament. This was the first time Germany failed to score in a shootout since Uli Stielike missed in the 1982 World Cup. Germany ended up winning the shootout 6–5. Müller's poor run of form throughout the tournament hurt Germany's chances. Eventually, Müller finished the tournament without adding a goal to his name at the Euros.

Müller was selected in Germany's final 23-man squad by manager Joachim Löw for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Müller played in all three matches for Germany against Mexico, Sweden and South Korea. Müller started against Mexico and Sweden, but came on as a substitute against South Korea. Müller did not manage to score a goal as Germany crashed out of the World Cup at the group stage.

On 5 March 2019, national team coach Joachim Löw confirmed that he would plan without Müller for the foreseeable future, along with his club teammates Jérôme Boateng and Mats Hummels. Müller said after the decision that he was "angry and surprised" why Löw decided to drop him and his Bayern teammates.

Müller's role can be described as an attacking all-rounder, a player able to play in a variety of forward positions. As he came through the youth system, he was seen primarily as a midfielder, but since breaking into the first-team he has been used in more forward roles. Both Bayern Munich and the Germany national team usually play a 4–2–3–1 formation, and Müller is most often part of the three attacking midfielders behind the central striker. He can play in any of the attacking midfield roles but usually plays in the centre for Bayern, and on the right for Germany. He has been used as an out-and-out striker on occasion.

Although he lacks physical strength, Müller has been praised for his maturity, pace, technique, awareness, tactical intelligence, and positioning. He has been particularly noted for his composure; Germany manager Joachim Löw said he is "impervious to pressure" and former Bayern manager Louis van Gaal said he has tremendous mental strength. A consistent scorer and creator of goals, he describes himself as a player who can find gaps in the opposition defence but not particularly good at dribbling or one-on-ones. Müller describes this role as "Raumdeuter", a term that translates to "interpreter of space" ( "Traumdeuter", "dream interpreter"). During 2014 World Cup, Germany manager Joachim Löw stated that Müller "is a very unorthodox player and you can't really predict his lines of running, but he has one aim and that is 'how can I score a goal?".

Müller was born in Weilheim, Upper Bavaria, and grew up in the nearby village of Pähl, which became the centre of media attention during his World Cup exploits. His parents are Klaudia and Gerhard, and he has a brother, Simon, who is two and a half years younger. He married his long-time girlfriend Lisa Trede, a semi-professional equestrian who works on a farm, in December 2009 after being engaged for two years. In June 2011, he became an ambassador for "YoungWings", a charity that helps children who have suffered bereavement or trauma. He is Roman Catholic.

Manuel Pascali

Manuel Pascali (born 9 September 1981) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder or defender for Italian Serie D side Fanfulla.

Pascali most famously captained Kilmarnock to a Scottish League Cup title in 2012. However, he didn't play in the final due to injury, and is considered by many to be one of the club's greatest players ever - even earning a plaque at Rugby Park next to other club legends.

He started his career with Sant'Angelo before moving on to Serie C2 with Pizzighettone and Carpenedolo. He then earned a move to Serie A with Parma in 2007, although he was loaned out to Foligno of Serie C1/A for the entire 2007–08 season.

He initially joined Kilmarnock on trial in July 2008 with a view to a one-year loan deal. During this period however, his performances convinced manager Jim Jefferies to part with an undisclosed fee to acquire him on a three-year deal. Upon joining Kilmarnock, Pascali revealed that Sergio Porrini played a role of Pascali joining a Scottish club and says he might be successful there [in Scotland], which he did later on in his Kilmarnock's career. On 9 August 2008, Pascali made his debut for the club in a 1–0 win over Hibernian. On 23 August 2008, Pascali scored his first goal for the club in the 45th minute in a 1–0 win over Hamilton Academical. His second goal came on 15 December 2008 in a 2–0 win over Motherwell. On 13 January 2009, Pascali provided an assist to an Allan Russell goal in a 2–1 defeat by Aberdeen. In his first season, Pascali made 35 appearances in all competitions and scored three goals (two in the league and one in the Scottish Cup against Ayr United in a 2–2 draw on 10 January 2009).

Pascali started the 2009–10 season with a win in the 3–1 triumph over Morton in the League Cup after coming on as a substitute early in the second half. He played his first league match of the season in a 3–1 win over St Mirren on 29 August. He was sent off in the league match against Rangers on 19 September, after a second bookable offence in a 0–0 draw. On 18 January 2010, Pascali scored his first of the season in a 1–0 win over Falkirk to advance Kilmarnock to the fifth round of the Scottish Cup. On 30 January 2010, Pascali scored his second of the season in a thrilling 4–4 draw against Dundee United. In his second season, Pascali made 26 appearances in total and scored two goals, one in the league and one in the Scottish Cup.

Pascali played in the first league match of the 2010–11 season, a 2–1 defeat by Rangers. On 10 November 2010, Pascali provided an assist to Conor Sammon in a 3–0 win over Hamilton, his first in almost two years. On 19 March 2011, Pascali scored his first goal of the season and also provided the assist for Jamie Hamill to score the second goal in a 3–1 win over Motherwell. On 23 April, Pascali scored a header in the 87th minute in a 4–2 defeat against Dundee United. Pascali provided an assist for James Fowler in his next game on 30 April against Hearts in a 2–2 draw. Pascali received 3 one-match bans after he received 18 yellow cards over the course of the season. Pascali featured 39 times and scored twice.

At the start of the season, Pascali started the 2011–12 campaign with a 1–1 draw against Dundee United on 24 July 2011 and soon became a temporary skipper for the club. After a match against Rangers on 27 September 2011, which Kilmarnock lost 2–0, Pascali was involved in an altercation in the tunnel with Rangers defender Steven Whittaker which Rangers' manager Ally McCoist dismissed as 'handbags' and "like two boys in the playground" in his post-match press conference. Manager Kenny Shiels wanted an end to the row that developed between Kirk Broadfoot and Pascali and referred to Broadfoot as "the ugly boy from Rangers" and "the male model from Ayrshire" in a radio interview. However, Broadfoot claimed Pascali made death threats and was "in my face saying he was going to kill me". In response to this, Pascali denied his [Broadfoot] claim and branded Broadfoot a publicity-seeking coward. Four days after the incident on 1 October 2011, Pascali scored his first of the season in a 2–1 defeat by St Johnstone. On 19 November 2011, Pascali scored his second goal of the season in a 1–1 draw against Hibernian, followed up by scoring the winning goal for Kilmarnock in a 1–0 win at Rugby Park against Rangers in the Scottish Premier League on 27 November 2011. Following his goal against Rangers, Pascali spoke to BBC Scotland's Chick Young and said scoring against Rangers was the best day of his career. On 7 January 2012, Pascali scored the only goal for Kilmarnock in a 1–1 draw against Dundee in the Scottish Cup. On 11 February 2012, Pascali broke his leg while stretching for the ball during training. He spent the rest of the 2011–12 season on the sidelines. He ended the season with 30 appearances and four goals (three in the league and one in the Scottish Cup). During his rehabilitation, Pascali signed a new deal with Kilmarnock. He penned a three-year contract and manager Shiels described Pascali as "one of the three quartermasters" along with Garry Hay and James Fowler.

Pascali made his first appearance since his leg injury in a 0–0 draw against Dundee in the opening game of the 2012–13 season on 4 August. Pascali then started Kilmarnock's next match, away to Inverness Caledonian Thistle and scored his first goal of the new campaign in a 1–1 draw. On 24 November, Pascali received a straight red card in the fifth minute after a foul on Nigel Hasselbaink in a 2–1 defeat by St Johnstone. His sending off was criticised by Kenny Shiels and after the match the club appealed the red card. However, the appeal was unsuccessful meaning Pascali would miss two matches. St Johnstone manager Steve Lomas spoke out about the sending off insisting the Kilmarnock supporters were wrong to jeer Hasselbaink after the winger was made the scapegoat by the home crowd. After the two match ban, Pascali returned to the squad in a 2–0 win over Aberdeen. On 19 January 2013, Pascali scored two goals in the 3–2 defeat by Dundee United. However the following month, Pascali suffered a hamstring injury during a match against Hearts, which he went off on the 75th minutes and will cause him to miss the rest of the season, like last season.

In the 2013-14 season, Pascali made his first team return, coming on as a substitute for Darren Barr in the 90th minutes, in a 0–0 draw against St Johnstone, having been absent from the Matchday squad in the opening game of the season against Aberdeen. After regaining his fitness for the club's reserve match, Pascali returned to the first team as a captain, which under his leadership, Pascali helped the club finish ninth place after the club struggled to get their first win for the first-nine matches. Pascali finished his 2013–14 season, making 32 appearance in all competitions, which he continued from injury plagued and suspension.

The 2014–15 season saw Pascali continued to remain captain for the club throughout the season. Pascali then scored his first goal for the club, in a 3–0 win over Partick Thistle on 27 September 2014. Unfortunately on 26 October 2014, Pascali was sent-off in the 34th minutes after a foul on Stefan Šćepović, as Kilmarnock lost 2–0 to Celtic. After serving one game, Pascali made his return on 8 November 2014, in a 3–0 loss against Ross County, which he was disappointed with the performance. The next game against Dundee United on 22 November 2014, Pascali scored his second goal of the season, in a 3–1 loss. Two months later on 24 January 2015, Pascali scored against Partick Thistle for the second time this season, which was a 2–2 draw. Unfortunately, Pascali soon be on the sidelined after ankle injury. Pascali made his return to the first team and went on to make 34 appearance and scoring three times in all competitions.

Despite keen to stay at the club for a long time and hinted of earning a testimonial match, Pascali was offered a new contract by the club. However, Pascali was unhappy with the contract length while negotiation. As a result, there were further hints that Pascali could leave the club to move abroad. On 18 June 2015, Pascali announced that he was set to leave Kilmarnock in June 2015, ending his seven years association with the club and later criticised the club's chairman Michael Johnston for creating a negative atmosphere around the club.

On 1 July 2015, it was announced that Pascali returned to Italy after seven years in Scotland and had signed for Cittadella in Lega Pro, the league formally known as Serie C. He made the move to Cosenza in July 2017.

On 31 January 2019, he joined Casertana.

On 4 July 2019, he signed with Fanfulla.

Pascali is married to Chiara, and has two sons. After having played for Kilmarnock for a number of years, Pascali commented that he never expected to live in the country for four years, and had begun to feel like a native. Pascali grew up supporting Inter Milan.

Tabaré Viudez

Tabaré Uruguay Viudez Mora (born 8 September 1989) is an Uruguayan footballer currently playing for Club Olimpia.

Viudez, played for Uruguayan champions' (Defensor Sporting) senior team for one year in the 2007–08 season and scored 6 goals.

In the 2008 Off-Season transfer window, Tabare Viudez attracted the attention of Milan along with Mathias Cardacio. Both players signed for the club after undergoing trials. Tabare Viudez was to wear the number '20' shirt, previously worn by Yoann Gourcuff. The Fonseca Group, who have the rights of the player, led the negotiations to transfer Viudez to the San Siro for the upcoming Serie A 2008–09 season. The Montevideo-born player, was relishing the new chapter in his career. 'I cannot believe it. It's a terrific jump up in my career,' he said. 'I must confess I have mixed feelings - nervousness and joy. This is a big step forward for me.' It was not known yet whether Viudez was to play for the first-team, play for Milan's Primavera squad (Under-20) or go out on loan for the season.

Viudez made several pre-season appearances for Milan. After coming on as a substitute at the half for Alberto Paloschi against Manchester City, Ancelotti praised his movement and pace after the match declaring him a player that can be relied on in the future, despite the narrow 1–0 loss. Viudez made his competitive debut in the Serie A coming on as a late substitute for David Beckham in a 3–0 win over Atalanta on 8 March 2009. This was also his only competitive match in Milan. And he was on the pitch for just 7 seconds before the final whistle, without touching the ball.

On 28 August 2009 Milan announced to have released Viudez (and fellow Uruguayan Mathías Cardacio) by mutual consent: he was later signed by his former club Defensor Sporting.

In 2010, he was bought from Mexican giants Club América to play for the next four seasons. He was loaned out to Necaxa.

In December 2010 Viudez signed for Club Nacional de Football facing the 2010-11 season's "Torneo Clausura". After Nacional won the "Clausura" Viudez scored the only goal in the season's final game against Defensor Sporting.
He was also a key player for Nacional to win the next season's championship.

His first appearance with River Plate was in the semi-finals of Copa Libertadores 2015 against Guarani (Paraguay). Viudez came in the second half of the game. He assists for an important goal for the game, making River Plate advance to the Final Championship phase. The first leg, in Mexico, he was injured and missed the second leg of the Championship game of Copa Libertadores in Buenos Aires.

His first goal came in the first appearance in the Argentina's Primera División against C.A. Colón in the second half. This game ended in a victory of River Plate 3-1, putting River Plate momentarily on top of the Argentina Primera División Championship 2015: Julio Humberto Grondona Trophy.

River Plate beat Tigres (Mex.) and won their 3rd Copa Libertadores title in 2015. A day after the victory, he traveled with the team to Japan to play against Gamba Osaka, in The Suruga Bank Cup 2015.

Viudez was part of Uruguay's 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup squad and was the youngest player representing them. In January 2009, Viudez joined up with Uruguay's 2009 South American Youth Championship in Venezuela. He played the first match in Uruguay's 2-0 victory over Bolivia and provided an impressive assist for the first goal to Nicolás Lodeiro. In the side's second match, Viudez scored a goal in the first minute in the side's 3-2 victory over Chile. He was part of Uruguay's team at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

Sascha Bigalke

Sascha Bigalke (born 8 January 1990) is a German footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for SpVgg Unterhaching in the 3. Liga.

Bigalke started his professional career with Hertha BSC, making his first appearance on 31 July 2008 in the 2008–09 UEFA Cup first qualifying round second leg against FC Nistru Otaci. In January 2011, he was set to transfer to Arminia Bielefeld, but the deal fell through when Bigalke broke his foot shortly before the completion of the transfer. Having made only a single league appearance for Hertha, he moved on a free transfer to SpVgg Unterhaching in July 2011.

At Unterhaching Bigalke became a key player, scoring nine goals and providing twelve assists in 45 matches (league and cup). After playing in a 1-2 first round DFB-Pokal loss against 1. FC Köln he drew the opponent's attention and signed for them in August 2012, on transfer deadline day. The transfer fee allegedly amounted to €400,000 and helped chronically cash-strapped Unterhaching obtain a playing license.

In his first season for 1. FC Köln, Bigalke played a decent role with 16 appearances with eight of them in the starting eleven. During the 2013-14 pre-season he tore his cruciate ligament running into the opponent's goalkeeper in a friendly against local side SF Troisdorf. Subsequently, he missed almost the whole season, only being substituted once at second to last matchday in a home fixture against FC St. Pauli in which Bigalke scored.

On 22 July 2014, 1. FC Köln announced that Bigalke, along with four more players, wouldn't be a part of the first team any more. Instead he was urged to leave the club and had to participate in training with the second team. Consequently, his contract was dissolved by mutual agreement and was able to return to Unteraching on a free transfer. He signed for them on a one-year deal including an extension clause for another year.

Bobby McNeal

Robert McNeal (19 January 1891 – 12 May 1956) was an English footballer who played as a left-half. Despite his career running through World War I he managed nearly 400 appearances in the Football League for West Bromwich Albion, playing in some of the most successful seasons in the club's history. He won the Second Division (1910–11), First Division (1919–20), and Charity Shield (1920), and played in the 1912 FA Cup Final.

McNeal was born in Hobson, County Durham, where he played football for the village team before he turned professional with West Bromwich Albion in June 1910. In his first full season he helped the club to the Second Division title. The "Throstles" then finished ninth in the First Division in 1911–12. He also won a runners-up medal in the 1912 FA Cup Final when Albion lost 1–0 to Barnsley in a replay at Bramall Lane. Albion went on to post top ten finishes in the league in 1912–13, 1913–14, and 1914–15, before the Football League was suspended due to World War I.

During the war he appeared as a guest player for Fulham, Middlesbrough, Notts County and Port Vale. McNeal was part of West Bromwich Albion's league championship-winning side of 1919–20. The team also won the 1920 Charity Shield with a 2–0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. Albion then dropped to 14th and 13th-place finishes in 1920–21 and 1921–22. They finished seventh in 1922–23 and 16th in 1923–24, before posting a second-place finish in 1924–25 – they ended the campaign just two points behind champions Huddersfield Town. In May 1925, McNeal retired through injury and became a licensee of a pub in the West Bromwich area. From 1926 to 1927, McNeal served as Albion's coach on a part-time basis.

McNeal earned two England caps during the 1914 British Home Championship, playing the two final England internationals before the onset of World War I, which caused the suspension of the competition until 1920. He was one of four England players to win their first cap on 16 March 1914 as Wales were defeated 2–0 at Ninian Park. His second and final cap came on 14 April as Scotland ran out 3–1 winners at Hampden Park. Overall the competition was something of a minor embarrassment for the country, as the Irish finished as champions and England finished third behind the Scots and just one point ahead of the Welsh.

Serey Dié

Sereso Geoffroy Gonzaroua Dié (born 7 November 1984), known as Serey Dié, is an Ivorian professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder in Switzerland for Aarau.

Born in Facobly, Dié started his football career with Centre National des Sports de Haut Niveau in Abidjan. He played one year for Volcan Junior and one year for CO Korhogo, before moving to top team Stade d'Abidjan in 2003. Three years later, he moved to EO Goulette et Kram in Tunisia. But this was also to remain a short stay, he cancelled his contract himself after just half a year.

Dié was invited for a trial with ES Sétif, and therefore moved to Algeria. This adventure nearly started and ended as a farce on the same day. As the club's president saw Dié, he thought that the wrong player had been hired and sent him home. The coach asked Dié to stay for the training, which he did and in a test match, he was able to convince the club's management to let him stay for a six-month trial. During this trial period, Dié played well and ES Sétif won the 2007–08 Arab Champions League, but he refused to sign the contact that he was subsequently offered.

Between 2008 and 2012, Dié played for Sion, with whom he won the Swiss Cup twice. During March 2010, he came under suspicion of corruption in connection with betting manipulation. In May 2012, he was the subject of controversy after cameras filmed him slapping a thirteen-year-old ball-boy in the face. This was during the away game against FC Lausanne-Sport on 2 May. This assault resulted in an eight match suspension.

On 13 December 2012, Basel announced the signing of Dié on a three-and-a-half year contract. He made his debut for Basel on 10 February 2013, in a 3–0 home win in St. Jakob-Park against his former club, Sion. He scored his first goal for Basel, the first goal of the match, in a 4–0 away win against Luzern in the Swissporarena, on 1 April 2013. At the end of the Swiss Super League season 2012–13, he won the Championship title and was Swiss Cup runner up with Basel. In the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League, Basel advanced as far as the semi-finals, there being matched against the reigning UEFA Champions League holders Chelsea, but were knocked out being beaten 2–5 on aggregate.

At the end of the 2013–14 Super League season, Dié won his second league championship with Basel. They also reached the final of the 2013–14 Swiss Cup, but were beaten 2–0 by Zürich after extra time. In the 2013–14 Champions League season, Basel, in the group stage, finished the group in third position to qualify for the Europa League knockout phase and then, they advanced as far as the quarter-finals. In their 2013–14 season, Basel played a total of 68 matches (36 Swiss League fixtures, 6 Swiss Cup, 6 Champions League and 10 Europa League and 10 test matches). Dié totaled 38 appearances, 22 League, 3 Cup, 4 Champions League and 5 Europa League as well 4 in the test games. He scored 2 goals in these matches.

The season 2014–15 was a successful one for Basel. Dié's season was an unlucky and unthankful one under the new trainer, Paulo Sousa. Despite the fact that Basel won the championship for the sixth time in a row that season and despite that Basel had entered the Champions League in the group stage, reaching the knockout phase on 9 December 2014, as they managed a 1-1 draw at Anfield against Liverpool, Dié totaled just 13 appearances during the first half of the season (7 League, 2 Cup, and just 2 in the Champions League, as well 2 further appearances in test games). Because Sousa did not rely on Dié, he was forced to leave the club during the winter break.

On 2 February 2015, Dié moved to Stuttgart. After returning victorious from the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, he featured in all but one of Stuttgart's remaining games, becoming a key member of the midfield.

On 15 July 2016, he returned to Basel. Under trainer Urs Fischer, he won the Swiss Super League championship at the end of the 2016–17 Super League season. For the club, this was the eighth title in a row and their 20th championship title in total. They also won the Swiss Cup for the twelfth time, which meant they had won the double for the sixth time in the club's history.

He represented Ivory Coast on 50 occasions between 2013 and 2019, scoring 2 goals.

At the 2014 FIFA World Cup, during Ivory Coast's match against Colombia, Dié was shown crying during the national anthem before the match. Despite rumors of his emotional feelings were for his father's death, this was inaccurate; Dié himself claimed that he did think about his father (who died in 2004), but that the emotion came from the intensity and excitement he felt while representing his national team.

Speaking after the programme in 2004, David Beckham said: "What I think impressed me about Matthew was when he was up against another of the hotshots Mollie, he was giving her a little bit of a chance, whereas some young kids wouldn't care. They just want to do their best and go straight through whether it's a girl or a boy. But that's what impressed me, he was a caring person. He was congratulating Mollie and saying well done to her. That's what I realised and recognised throughout the day ... and he's a great talent of course."

Rhysh Roshan Rai (born 23 April 1985) is a midfielder for Home United FC.
Roshan's amateur football experience began at the age of 11 when his father encouraged him to attend trials MILO National Soccer School was hosting. This school was established in 1974 as a means of grooming teenage sporting talent through its youth development programs. Impressed by his potential, the scout at the trial proceeded to select the left footer to represent the 'West' zone.

Roshan played for this division for 2 years before advancing to Clementi Khalsa FC (Under-14). He was also concurrently playing for his school's (Anglo-Chinese School – Barker) soccer team. Unbeknownst to this young flair, a scout was present at one of these games and approached his school's coach. A chance to play for Home United stemmed out of this fortuity. Roshan nabbed this opportunity and represented Home United for the next 3–4 years. National service soon beckoned and he took a much required half-time from football.

In 2007, while pursuing his 2-year degree in Mass Communication, he played professionally for Balestier Khalsa FC.

Bob Delgado

Robert Allan Delgado (born 29 January 1949) is a Welsh former footballer who made 281 league appearances in a ten-year career in the Football League. He was a versatile player with power both in the air and in the tackle.

He moved from non-league Barry Town to Luton Town in 1970, before joining Carlisle United the following year. Following a loan spell with Workington in 1973, he moved on to Rotherham United. He helped the "Millers" to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1974–75, before joining Chester in October 1975 for £6,000. He was sold on to Port Vale for £30,000 in December 1978, before leaving the English game for American club Miami Americans in 1980. He later had spells with English club Oswestry Town, Welsh club Colwyn Bay, and Hong Kong side Bulova SA.

Delgado signed for Luton Town from Barry Town in February 1970, after Harry Haslam spotted him playing for the Southern League side. However, he never took to the field at Kenilworth Road, and was moved on to Carlisle United in 1971. The "Cumbrians" finished tenth in the Second Division in 1971–72 under Ian MacFarlane. Failing to nail down a first team place at Brunton Park under new boss Alan Ashman in 1972–73, Delgado was loaned out to Workington of the Fourth Division. A move to Rotherham United followed, who had just been demoted to the basement division of the Football League. Jimmy McGuigan guided the "Millers" to 15th in 1973–74, before the Millmoor outfit returned to the Third Division with a third-place finish in 1974–75.

He moved to league rivals Chester in October 1975, with manager Ken Roberts paying out a £6,000 fee. He became a favourite with the fans thanks to his 'hard man' approach. The "Seals" finished in the lower half of the table in 1975–76 and 1976–77, as new boss Alan Oakes began to build his own team. Chester missed out on promotion in 1977–78 by two places and two points. Delgado left Sealand Road in December 1978, when Port Vale manager Dennis Butler splashed out £30,000 to secure Delgado's services. He made his debut on Boxing Day in a 6–2 defeat to Barnsley at Oakwell. He played 24 games in 1978–79 and 19 games in 1979–80, as the "Valiants" had some of their poorest seasons in the Fourth Division. Delgado never showed his best form at Vale Park, the low point in his spell coming when he scored an own goal in a 7–1 defeat to Huddersfield Town at Leeds Road. His contract was cancelled in May 1980 by new manager John McGrath, following three months on the sidelines.

He subsequently joined up with short-lived American Soccer League side Miami Americans, who only competed for the 1980 season. He then joined Welsh club Oswestry Town. He joined Hong Kong based Bulova SA for the 1983–84 season, and helped the club to secure second place in the First Division League. He then returned to Britain and played for Colwyn Bay.

Delgado later managed Upton AA in the West Cheshire League and played for veterans side Chester Nomads, while working as a sales manager for a travel company.

Sergio Busquets

Sergio Busquets Burgos (, ; born 16 July 1988) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder and is the vice-captain of both Barcelona and the Spain national team. Busquets is widely regarded as one of the greatest defensive midfielders of his generation, and by some to be among the finest of modern era.

A one-club man, he arrived in Barcelona's first team in July 2008, and eventually made a name for himself in a relatively short period of time. He reached the Spain national team less than one year after making his senior club debut.

Busquets helped Spain win the 2010 World Cup and the Euro 2012 tournaments. He also represented the nation at two other World Cups and Euro 2016.

Born in Sabadell, Barcelona, Catalonia, Busquets began playing football with local team CD Badia del Vallès, followed by spells with CEF Barberà Andalucía, UE Lleida and UFB Jàbac Terrassa, before joining Barcelona's youth ranks in 2005. He scored seven goals in 26 games for the "Juvenil A" team in his second season and, two years later, Busquets was promoted to the B team under Pep Guardiola, and helped him achieve promotion to the third division. In that same season he would make his first-team debut, coming on as a substitute in the Copa Catalunya.

On 13 September 2008, Busquets played his first La Liga match, featuring 90 minutes in a 1–1 home draw to Racing de Santander. During Barcelona's UEFA Champions League clash against Basel at St. Jakob-Park on 22 October 2008, he scored the second goal in the 15th minute in a 5–0 group stage win; in early December, in another start, he scored his second with "Barça" in the competition, netting in the 83rd minute of a 2–3 home loss against Shaktar Donetsk.

On 22 December 2008, Busquets signed a contract extension until 2013 with a buy-out clause of €80 million. On 7 March 2009 he scored his first league goal, in a 2–0 home win over Athletic Bilbao. On 27 May, having been regularly played as he competed for the spot with internationals Seydou Keita and Yaya Touré, he also featured in Barcelona's starting eleven in the Champions League final, a 2–0 win over Manchester United; with that victory, Carles and Sergio Busquets became only the third father-and-son combo to both have won Europe's top club competition playing for the same team, joining Manuel Sanchís Martínez and Manuel Sanchís Hontiyuelo (won it with Real Madrid) and Cesare Maldini and Paolo Maldini (A.C. Milan).

Busquets' fine form continued in the 2009–10 campaign, with Guardiola preferring him to Touré as Barcelona's central holding midfielder. In the Champions League semi-final against Inter Milan at Camp Nou on 28 April 2010, he went down to the ground after Thiago Motta had raised his arm and appeared to push Busquets directly in the face. As a result of this action, the former was shown a red card and dismissed for violent conduct, whilst the latter was subsequently criticised by both Motta and the media for apparently feigning injury.

Busquets was again ever-present in 2010–11, even playing as a central defender on occasion. On 27 January 2011, he signed a contract extension that would keep him at the club until 2015 – the buyout clause was increased to €150 million. On 8 March, playing at centre back, he scored an own goal from a corner kick against Arsenal, in the season's Champions League round-of-16, levelling the score at 1–1; Barcelona eventually won the game 3–1 (and 4–3 on aggregate).

On 24 April 2012, Busquets scored a rare goal – only his sixth official one in four years – netting from an easy tap-in after an Isaac Cuenca cross to make it 1–0 for the hosts in the second leg of the Champions League semi-finals against Chelsea. Barcelona could only draw 2–2 against ten men, losing 2–3 on aggregate.

On 16 July 2013, the day he celebrated his 25th birthday, Busquets agreed to a new deal until 2018, with the buyout clause remaining unaltered. On 1 August 2014, after the retirement of Carles Puyol and at the veteran's personal request, he was given the number 5 shirt for the upcoming campaign.

On 6 June 2015, Busquets started in the final of the Champions League, as the team won their fifth accolade in the competition by beating Juventus at Berlin's Olympiastadion. This made Barcelona the first club in history to win the treble of domestic league, domestic cup and European Cup twice, and Dani Alves, Busquets, Andrés Iniesta, Lionel Messi, Pedro, Gerard Piqué and Xavi the only players to achieve the same feat.

On 1 October 2017, Busquets opened the scoring in a 3–0 home win against Las Palmas which was played with closed doors at the Camp Nou due to the ongoing Catalan independence referendum. He made his 100th Champions League appearance on 11 December 2018, in a 1–1 group stage home draw to Tottenham Hotspur.

On 11 October 2008, Busquets earned his first cap for Spain's under-21 in their 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification play-offs first-leg away match against Switzerland. He scored in the 17th minute of a 1–2 loss, though they eventually emerged victorious 4–3 on aggregate.

On 11 February 2009, Busquets was called up to the senior squad for a friendly against England. He was named as a substitute for a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Turkey on 28 March 2009, making his debut in the return match on 1 April, playing 16 minutes in a 2–1 win in Istanbul after replacing David Silva.

Busquets was selected by manager Vicente del Bosque for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, assuming the holding midfielder role naturalized Brazilian Marcos Senna had previously occupied in the conquest of UEFA Euro 2008. He played all of the tournament's games and minutes for the eventual world champions, save the last 30 minutes of the 0–1 group-stage loss against Switzerland.

On 8 September 2014, Busquets scored his first international goal in a 5–1 win over Macedonia during Euro 2016's qualifying phase. His second came during the same tournament on 15 November, in the 3–0 defeat of Belarus in Huelva.

Busquets celebrated his 100th appearance for Spain on 9 October 2017, in a 1–0 away win against Israel for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers. Subsequently, he was named in Julen Lopetegui's squad for the finals in Russia.

Busquets is usually deployed as either a central or defensive midfielder, although he is also capable of playing as a central defender. A hard-working player, he excels at intercepting loose balls and breaking down opposition plays due to his positional sense, defensive attributes, tactical intelligence, and ability to read the game. Due to his vision, ball control, physical prowess, technical skills and accurate passing ability, he rarely relinquishes possession, and alongside both his current and former midfield teammates, such as Iniesta, Xavi and Ivan Rakitić, he has also played an important creative role in setting his team's tempo in midfield as a deep-lying playmaker through his passing game.

Manager del Bosque praised Busquets, saying, "If you watch the whole game, you won't see Busquets—but watch Busquets, and you will see the whole game." The latter's height also allows him to be effective in the air, and enables him to advance into more offensive positions on occasion, providing an additional attacking outlet for his team.
Busquets was largely accused of diving by the media on a number of occasions, due to opposition players being wrongly booked or even sent-off during the game because of his excessive play-acting and protests. However, in response to these criticisms, he defended diving in football as "intelligent" play.

Often considered to be one of the most underrated footballers in the world, Busquets earned praise from his peers, with club teammate Messi saying "When there will be trouble, he [Busquets] will be there."

Busquets' father, Carles, was also a footballer. He played as a goalkeeper for Barcelona for several years during the 1990s, although almost exclusively as a backup.

In 2014, Busquets started a relationship with Elena Galera. In 2016, the couple welcomed their son Enzo. He sported an Arabic tattoo on his left forearm translating to "A thing for you, the life in my country", dedicated to his maternal grandfather to whom he was very close.

Giovani dos Santos

Giovani dos Santos Ramírez ( ; born 11 May 1989) is a Mexican professional footballer who plays for Liga MX club América and the Mexico national team. A versatile forward, dos Santos can play as an attacking midfielder, winger and secondary striker.

Dos Santos began his football career at a very young age, being recruited by Spanish club Barcelona and played for their B team until age 18. He made his way up the ranks, eventually playing for the senior squad, making his debut in 2007. That year, he was named by "World Soccer Magazine" as one of the "Top 50 Most Exciting Teen Footballers". After playing one season, Dos Santos was transferred to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur in 2008 in search for more playing time. Though he would stay with the club until 2012, his time there was mostly spent away on loan, at Ipswich Town, Galatasaray and Racing de Santander, with varying degrees of success. Spurs eventually sold dos Santos to Mallorca in 2012, and he was sold a year later to Villarreal. After a three-year stint, he was sold to LA Galaxy in July 2015, who went on to buy out his contract and release him prior to the 2019 season.

Dos Santos was a member of the Mexico under-17 team that won the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship held in Peru. He made his debut for the senior national team in a 1–0 victory over Panama on 9 September 2007, and represented "El Tri" at the 2010, 2014, and 2018 FIFA World Cups, along with the 2013 and 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.

Dos Santos once again played a significant role during the tournament and helped the team win the national title of the Juvenil A category.

In 2006, Dos Santos was invited on the pre-season tour of Barcelona's senior squad; during a friendly match on 29 July 2006, he scored in his senior team debut game against Danish club AGF Aarhus.

On 18 June 2008, Dos Santos passed a medical and agreed terms to complete his move to Tottenham from Barcelona. Barcelona reported that the transfer fee was €6 million with an additional €5 million payable depending on appearances for Tottenham.

The young Mexican was on target twice as Tottenham beat local Spanish side UD Tavernes in an 8–0 thumping on their 2008–09 pre-season tour. He also played in Spurs' other pre-season games including the 5–1 wins over Leyton Orient and Norwich City. He also scored the second goal in the 3–0 win over Borussia Dortmund to help Spurs to make it two wins out of two and take home the Feyenoord Jubileum Tournament trophy. He scored his first competitive goal for Spurs in the UEFA Cup on 26 February 2009 against Shakhtar Donetsk. After 12 first team appearances, he was sent on loan to Ipswich Town for the remainder of the season.

Dos Santos returned to Tottenham at the start of the 2009–10 season and his first game of the season came against Doncaster Rovers in the League Cup, in which he provided an assist. He was substituted off, however, due to an ankle injury early on in a League Cup game against Preston North End and managed to make only a substitute appearance in a 1–0 loss to Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Dos Santos' commitment was questioned by then Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp, who warned him to stay away from nightclubs and revealed that he was often late for training on Mondays. Redknapp assured Dos Santos, however, that he was still part of his plans at Tottenham.

Dos Santos scored and had an assist in Tottenham's UEFA Europa League group match against Shamrock Rovers on 29 September 2011 at White Hart Lane. On 7 January 2012, he scored a goal and completed an assist for a 3–0 win against Cheltenham Town in the third round of the FA Cup.

He also claimed an assist and a goal from the penalty spot in Ipswich's 3–2 win over local rivals Norwich City a week later. He finished his loan with four goals in eight appearances.

In January 2010, Dos Santos signed for Turkish club Galatasaray on loan for the remainder of the 2009–10 season, with an option to purchase him at the end of that period. The move reunited the player with Frank Rijkaard, his former coach at Barcelona. On 31 January, Dos Santos made his debut coming on as a 58th-minute substitute for Emre Çolak in a Süper Lig game against Denizlispor, a 2–1 victory. He returned to Tottenham in the summer having failed to score for Galatasaray, and stayed there for half a season before being loaned to La Liga club Racing de Santander in January.

On 31 January 2011, Dos Santos joined La Liga side Racing de Santander on loan until the end of the season from Tottenham. He made his debut for his new club on 5 February 2011 as a substitute against Real Zaragoza, drawing the game 1–1. He scored his first goal as a substitute against Villarreal in the 68th minute on 27 February 2011. Dos Santos scored a brace in a 3–2 win league match over Hércules.

It was reported that Dos Santos had told Tottenham that he wanted a move in the summer of 2012 or else he would leave on a free transfer during the next transfer window. His agent stated there was interest from Serie A club Inter Milan, as well as La Liga clubs such as Sevilla and Atlético Madrid.

On 31 August 2012, Dos Santos signed a four-year deal with Spanish outfit Mallorca, being introduced as their new number 9. On 22 October, he made his debut for Mallorca, playing 60 minutes and assisting both goals in a 3–2 away defeat to Sevilla. He played another 60 minutes on 28 October in a 5–0 home defeat to Real Madrid. Dos Santos scored his first goal for Mallorca against Espanyol on 18 January 2013. Though Mallorca would finish the season in 18th place and was relegated, Dos Santos was a mainstay in the squad, amassing 32 total appearances and finished as their top goal-scorer with six goals as well as seven assists.

On 9 July 2013, Dos Santos completed a much speculated move to recently promoted side Villarreal for a reported €6 million. He finished the 2013–14 season with 11 goals and 8 assists, helping the club finish the season in sixth place.

On 15 July 2015, the Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy announced the signing of dos Santos as a Designated Player, in a reported US$7 million deal.

On 6 August, dos Santos made his competitive debut and scored his first competitive goal for the Galaxy in a CONCACAF Champions League fixture against Trinidadian side Central FC. Three days later, he made his MLS debut and scored a goal and provided an assist in the 3–1 win over Seattle Sounders FC.

In July 2016, dos Santos was included in the roster for the 2016 MLS All-Star Game. On 21 July 2016, he came off of the bench during the quarter-finals of the U.S. Open Cup, scoring within three minutes of coming onto the pitch.

In July 2017, Dos Santos was included in the roster for the 2017 MLS All-Star Game.

On 1 March 2019, LA Galaxy announced they had exercised its one offseason buyout of a guaranteed contract on dos Santos, thus releasing him from the team.

On 6 July 2019, Dos Santos officially joined Mexican side Club América. He will play in the Liga MX for the first time after reaching a three-year agreement with América, being handed the number 10 shirt. In his first "Súper Clasico" against Guadalajara on 28 September, dos Santos suffered a thigh injury mid-match following a tackle from Antonio Briseño, with the defender piercing dos Santos' skin with his studs and leaving a deep gash in his right leg. He was stretchered off the field and immediately taken to a nearby hospital. Club América later released a statement stating the player had suffered a wound in the quadriceps of the right thigh and would require surgery, thereby ruling him out of action for up to six weeks.

Dos Santos participated at the 2001 Danone Nations Cup that was held at the Parc des Princes, Paris, where 40 countries also participated. Mexico would finish the tournament fifth, and Dos Santos won the Golden Boot award for top goalscorer.

During the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship, which his team won, Dos Santos assisted half of the goals of Mexico during the tournament, a feat that won him the Adidas Silver Ball as the second best player of the tournament, finishing behind only to Brazilian midfielder Anderson.

In the U-20 World Cup Qualifiers, Dos santos scored twice; once against St. Kitts and Nevis in the 86th minute and the second against Jamaica in the 56th minute. He was forced to sit out the last game for precautionary reasons against Costa Rica, as he had received a yellow card in the previous match. The game ended in a 1–1 draw, but Mexico still qualified, finishing top of the regional group.

During the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, Mexico was placed in Group C, where they were drawn against Gambia, Portugal and New Zealand. On 2 July 2007, Dos Santos and the rest of the Mexico team played against Gambia and won 3–0, with Dos Santos opening the scoring in the second half with a volley into the top left-hand corner from outside of the box. He then played against Portugal, where Mexico won 2–1, scoring the opening goal from the penalty spot. As Mexico had already qualified from the group, he was rested for the game against New Zealand. In the round of 16, Mexico played against Congo and Dos Santos returned to the starting line-up and yet again opened the scoring with a goal from the penalty spot in a match that Mexico won 3–0. In the quarter-finals, Mexico was eliminated by Argentina by an own goal on the second-half, which was the only goal of the game in a 1–0. Dos Santos was awarded the Adidas Bronze Ball.

In June 2012, Dos Santos was called up to play with the Mexico under-23 squad that would participate at the 2012 London Olympics. On 29 July, he started on the bench but later scored his first two goals against Gabon, earning Mexico a 2–0 win. Dos Santos scored his third goal of the tournament on 4 August against Senegal, scoring a crucial tie breaking goal in the 98th minute of extra time to give Mexico a 3–2 lead, which eventually led to a 4–2 win. He was in the starting XI for the semi-final match against Japan and played the first half of the game, but was substituted out for Raúl Jiménez in the 46th minute due to an injury, which ultimately ruled him out of the final against Brazil. Dos Santos was, however, on the bench and watched Mexico defeat Brazil 2–1 at Wembley Stadium.

Dos Santos earned his first selection for a Mexico senior team roster when Hugo Sánchez picked him for exhibition games against Panama and Brazil. Dos Santos appeared for the first time for Mexico in a 1–0 victory over Panama on 9 September 2007 wearing the number 10 jersey. The match was abandoned at half time because of heavy rain. He scored his first two goals for Mexico on 24 June 2009 in a friendly match against Venezuela, a game in which he was also named Man of the Match.

Dos Santos scored his third goal for Mexico on 19 July in the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup quarter-final game against Haiti in the 42nd minute and also recorded two assists in the 4–0 victory. On 26 July 2009, he helped Mexico end a ten-year drought of victory against the United States on American soil with a 5–0 victory that helped secure Mexico's fifth CONCACAF Gold Cup. He was named player of the tournament.

On 5 September 2009, Dos Santos contributed to all three goals in a 3–0 win over Costa Rica in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification stages. He scored the first goal from outside the penalty box with his preferred left foot and assisted in the following two goals.

When his brother Jonathan dos Santos was cut from Mexico's final 23-man squad for the 2010 World Cup, his father Zizinho said that Dos Santos was very hurt and claimed he was unsure whether he would play in the World Cup.

At the 2010 World Cup final stage, Dos Santos started in every game for Mexico as a right winger. He completed 138 passes without providing an assist. He was voted runner-up for the FIFA Young Player of the Tournament award, which eventually went to Thomas Müller of Germany.

Dos Santos was called up to play the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup after a good mid-season loan to Racing de Santander. On 9 June 2011, he scored a brace against Cuba in a 5–0 win. In the final match against the United States, he scored in a 4–2 win by dribbling inside the box against goalkeeper Tim Howard and chipping the ball into the top-left corner over Eric Lichaj. That goal was also named the best goal of the tournament.

Dos Santos was called up by Miguel Herrera to play the 2014 World Cup. He played in Mexico's World Cup opener against Cameroon, and on 29 June 2014, opened the scoring in a 2–1 round of 16 defeat against the Netherlands with a left-footed long range strike.

In May 2018 he was named in Mexico's preliminary 28-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, and in June 2018, he was named in the final 23-man squad for the World Cup.

A quick, skillful and creative player, Dos Santos is capable of playing in several offensive positions. He is usually deployed as a winger or as an attacking midfielder, and has even been used as a supporting striker. A technically gifted playmaker who possesses great flair and dribbling skills, he has been described as a "clever" and "sharp" player who has the capacity to both score goals and create chances for teammates. As a youngster, he drew attention to himself as a precocious talent, and in 2010 he was named by "Don Balón" as one the 100 best young players in the world born after 1989.

Dos Santos is the son of former Brazilian footballer Zizinho, who played for Mexico clubs América and León in the late 1980s. His mother, Liliana Ramírez, is a Mexican national. Dos Santos has two brothers and two half-brothers; the elder, Éder, played for América's reserves team as a defensive midfielder before retiring in 2009, and his younger brother, Jonathan, currently plays for LA Galaxy. Dos Santos has appeared on the cover of the MLS custom editions of "FIFA 16" and "FIFA 17".

Winston White

Eric Winston White (born 26 October 1958) is an English former footballer who made 529 league appearances with 13 different clubs in a 17-year career in the Football League.

He began his career with Leicester City, before signing with Hereford United three years later. In 1983, he ended up at Bury following brief stays at Hong Kong Rangers, Chesterfield, Port Vale and Stockport County. He helped the "Shakers" to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1984–85. Loaned out to Rochdale, he was allowed to sign with Colchester United on a free transfer in March 1987. He was sold on to Burnley for £17,500 in October 1988, before he joined West Bromwich Albion for a £35,000 fee in 1991. He was released from his contract in October 1992, and then had brief spells with Bury, Doncaster Rovers, Carlisle United, and Wigan Athletic.

White began his career at Leicester City, who finished 11th in the First Division in 1976–77 under Jimmy Bloomfield's stewardship. The "Foxes" were relegated in last place in 1977–78 under Frank McLintock, before finishing just three places and three points above the Second Division relegation zone in 1978–79 under Jock Wallace, Jr. White then left Filbert Street for Hereford United for a fee of £15,000 in March 1979. He played a total of 208 league and cup games for the "Bulls", scoring 24 goals. In 1979, he played in a benefit match for West Bromwich Albion's Len Cantello, that saw a team of white players play against a team of black players.

Manager Frank Lord failed to take the club out of the Fourth Division re-election zone in 1979–80 or 1980–81, though the Edgar Street outfit did reach tenth in 1981–82, before finishing bottom of the Football League in 1982–83 under Tommy Hughes. White left Hereford in 1983, moving to Hong Kong to turn out for Hong Kong Rangers of the Hong Kong First Division League. After returning to his native England he had trials with Chesterfield and Port Vale, appearing as a substitute for the "Valiants" in a 2–1 Third Division defeat at Newport County on 29 October 1983, before leaving Vale Park two days later. He moved on to Bury via Stockport County, both of whom were in the Fourth Division. The "Shakers" finished 15th in 1983–84 under Jim Iley, before clinching the fourth automatic promotion place in 1984–85 under Martin Dobson. White left Gigg Lane for a loan spell at Rochdale, who were struggling back in the Fourth Division. Bury held on to their Third Division status in 1985–86 and 1986–87.

White signed with Colchester United on a free transfer in March 1987. He made 78 appearances in all competitions, including 50 in 1987–88, before joining Burnley for a fee of £17,500 in October 1988. During his time at Layer Road the club slipped down the Fourth Division, as Mike Walker was replaced by Roger Brown and then Steve Foley. He scored twice against Colchester on 10 February 1989, hitting six goals in 39 games for the "Clarets" in 1988–89; the "Lancashire Telegraph" ran with the headline "Winston turns on the black magic". Manager Brian Miller had left Turf Moor the previous month, and the club improved under new boss Frank Casper. White scored nine goals (including six penalties) in 50 appearances in 1989–90. He then hit six goals in 40 games in 1990–91, helping the club to the play-offs, where they were beaten by Torquay United. Before the play-offs came he was signed by West Bromwich Albion for a £35,000 fee.

The "Baggies" slipped out of the Second Division in 1990–91, and missed out on the Third Division play-offs by one place and three points in 1991–92 under Bobby Gould. White was released from his contract at The Hawthorns by new boss Osvaldo Ardiles in October 1992. He returned to former club Bury, who were managed by his former boss Mike Walsh, and saw the 1992–93 season out with brief spells at Doncaster Rovers, Carlisle United and Wigan Athletic.

White was a crowd pleaser who "played football with a smile on his face, and terrorised teams with his tricky wing play."

After retiring from football, White co-owned a restaurant in Padiham, and was later appointed Regional Sales Manager at Life Fitness. After gaining a bachelor's degree in Business and also studying for an MBA he now works with a worldwide soccer agency and also runs a health and fitness consultancy business.

Francisco Olazar

Francisco Olazar ( July 10, 1885 – September 21, 1958) was an Argentine football player and later coach. His position on the field was central midfielder.

At club level, he spent his entire career playing for Racing Club, where he won eight Primera División league titles and eight National cups. Olazar also played for the Argentina national team, being the team coach at the 1930 FIFA World Cup.

Olazar was born in Quilmes. He first played at Club Mariano Moreno, a small institution in Avellaneda, Greater Buenos Aires. In 1908 he joined Racing Club, where he started playing at 4th. division.

Playing as central midfielder ("number 5") Olazar was part of the Racing Club team that became legendary for their playing style and success, winning seven consecutive Primera División titles from 1913 to 1919, a landmark that still is a record in Argentine football and originated the "Academy" nickname for Racing Club that has identified the institution since then. Racing Club is considered successor of another legendary team, Alumni (dissolved in 1911), the most winning team of the first years of organised football in the country.

Olazar was one of the Racing Club most notable players because of his technique and his strength to recover the ball. He also captained the team during all those successful years. He scored a total of 37 goals playing for Racing Club. 

As a key player of the Racing Club that won seven consecutive Primera División championships, Olazar was regarded as the best Argentine centre-half in those years. He was idolised by Racing Club supporters, and often compared with Uruguayan star José Piendibene, with whom he shared mutual respect.

He played for the Argentina national team on 18 occasions including appearances at the first two Copa América tournaments in 1916 and 1917.

After retiring as a player Olazar turned to coaching, and managed the Argentina team that won a Copa América trophy in 1929. He was also the coach of the team that took part of the first FIFA World Cup in 1930, where he and technical director Juan José Tramutola managed the "albicelestes" to second-place behind hosts Uruguay.

Andreas Lipa (born 26 April 1971) is an Austrian football manager and former footballer who played as a defender and midfielder.

During a 19-year career, Lipa was active as a professional in Austria, Greece and England, playing for First Vienna, LASK, Austria Salzburg, Austria Lustenau, Grazer AK, Skoda Xanthi, Port Vale, Wiener Sport-Club and SV Wienerberg. He later managed First Vienna FC.

He also played at international level, earning one cap for the Austrian national team in 2000.

Born in Vienna, Lipa spent his early career in his native Austria with First Vienna, LASK, Austria Salzburg, Austria Lustenau and Grazer AK.

Lipa left Austrian football, and after a trial with English club Portsmouth in January 2002, he joined up with Greek side Skoda Xanthi. Coach Nikos Karageorgiou led the Alpha Ethniki club to a 9th-place finish in 2002–03. In June 2003 he returned to England to sign with Port Vale of the Second Division. During a 5–1 defeat to Plymouth Argyle at Vale Park on 18 October 2003, Lipa made a racist comment to Plymouth player Jason Bent. Lipa wrote a letter of apology to Bent and said "he wished he could turn the clock back", but was docked a week's wages. Bent accepted the apology as Lipa claimed to have spoke "in the heat of the moment" and the club also issued a statement of apology, stating Lipa "is in no way racist". Despite this he was still charged by the Football Association. He scored twice in 33 games in 2003–04, finding himself sidelined from the first team after manager Brian Horton was replaced by Martin Foyle.

Orosco Anonam

Orosco Anonam (born 15 June 1979 in Nigeria) is a professional footballer who plays for Maltese Football League side Tarxien Rainbows, where he plays as a defender, and occasionally as a midfielder and a striker.

Orosco Anonam was born in Nigeria, but moved to Malta at an early age and began his playing career with Naxxar Lions of the Maltese Premier League. His first season with the club was the 1998–99 season. He found himself a regular in the team and 21 appearances, and scored seven goals in his debut season, as Naxxar Lions recorded a 6th-place finish in the Maltese Premier League.

Anonam continued to impress at Naxxar Lions, and went into the 1999–00 season hoping to help the club maintain a respectable league position. He helped Naxxar Lions finish in 7th position in the Maltese Premier League that season, making 19 appearances, and scoring a very impressive 13 goals.

Following a string on impressive performances for Naxxar Lions, Orosco left the club and joined fellow Maltese Premier League outfit Sliema Wanderers for the 2000–01 season. In his first season with Sliema Wanderers, Anonam made 26 appearances and scored 22 goals, helping his new club to a place finish in the Maltese Premier League.

For the 2001–02 season, Orosco was loaned out to Hungarian outfit Vasas SC. The stint was only a brief one, with Anonam making just two appearances, but failed to score. He returned to Sliema Wanderers for the remainder of the 2000–01 season, he went on to make 24 appearances and scored seven goals, helping Sliema Wanderers to a 2nd-place finish in the Maltese Premier League.

Anonam went into the 2002–03 season, making another loan move overseas, this time joining Cypriot side APOEL, the stint lasted longer than the previous one. Orosco again returned to Sliema Wanderers for the remainder of the 2002–03 season, he went on to make 15 appearances and scored six goals, helping Sliema Wanderers to a 3rd-place finish in the Maltese Premier League.

Orosco went into the 2003–04 season hoping to win some silverware with Sliema Wanderers, Anonam achieved this as the club recorded a 1st-place finish in the Maltese Premier League. Over the course of the season Orosco made 24 appearances and scored six goals.

For the 2004–05 season, Orosco and Sliema Wanderers continued to emulate the successes of previous season. Anonam made 21 appearances and scored four goals, as Sliema Wanderers completed the domestic double, finishing in 1st position in the Maltese Premier League and winning the U*Bet FA Trophy.

Anonam and Sliema Wanderers went into the 2005–06 looking to add to their previous successes, however Anonam did not have a great deal of impact on the season as the club failed to retain the Maltese Premier League title, which Birkirkara went on to win by two points, with Sliema Wanderers recording a 2nd-place finish, Orosco made 11 appearances, but failed to score during the season.

Orosco went on to the 2006–07 hoping to win more trophies, however Sliema Wanderers recorded another 2nd-place finish, but were beaten comprehensively by Marsaxlokk, who won the title by 11 points. Anonam made 19 appearances and scored two goals.

The 2007–08 season turned out to be Orosco’s last season with Sliema Wanderers. The club had a disappointing season by their own high standards, finishing in 4th position in the Maltese Premier League. Orosco notched up 23 appearances and scored three goals, throughout the season.

Orosco Anonam joined Maltese Premier League rivals Floriana from Sliema Wanderers just before the start of the 2008–09 season. Floriana hoped that signing Anonam would boost the club's attacking line up, although he primarily took up a role of playing just the front man. Orosco added experience and talent to a relatively young side and showed great versatility that would pay dividends to him and the team throughout season. In his debut season with Floriana, Orosco made 25 appearances and scored 7 goals, as Floriana recorded a place finish in the Maltese Premier League.

The 2009–10 season began with the appointment of Irish manager Roddy Collins as the new manager of Floriana. He found himself using Orosco as a central defender, mainly due to injuries and a shortage in experienced players to play the position.

Anonam’s excellent versatility continued to show. On the opening day of the season, Orosco scored a fantastic goal, when he hit a cracking drive from the edge of the box against Qormi, capping off an impressive first competitive outing in defence.

In October 2009, assistant manager Tony Alamango left the club. Orosco was appointed as the club's new assistant manager, as well as still continuing in a playing capacity. Manager, Roddy Collins left the club in January 2010, with Anonam been given the role of the club's caretaker manager, until Serbian Zoran Popovic was re-appointed as the club's manager. Orosco returned to his role of player-assistant manager.

The 2009–10 season proved to be another difficult one for Floriana, with the club slipping into the relegation pool, but Orosco helped the club finish safely in 7th position. Over the season, Anonam played 21 games and scored two goals.

On 24 July 2010, Orosco Anonam left Floriana and joined fellow Maltese Premier League team Tarxien Rainbows, signing a two-year deal with the club.
