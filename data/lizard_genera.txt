Phelsuma

Phelsuma is a large genus of geckos in the family Gekkonidae. Species in the genus "Phelsuma" are commonly referred to as day geckos.

Some day geckos are seriously endangered and some are common, but all "Phelsuma" species are CITES Appendix II listed. Little is known about trade in day geckos, but the IUCN considers it a threat to some species. Some species are captive-bred.

In contrast to most other gecko species, day geckos of the genus "Phelsuma" are active mainly during the day. Other diurnal geckos include species of the genera "Lygodactylus" and "Gonatodes". Like most other geckos, day geckos lack eyelids, instead having rounded pupils and a clear, fixed plate covering their eyes which they clean with their tongues. Many species have bright green, red, and blue colors which make them popular terrarium or vivarium pets. These brilliant colors play a role in intraspecies recognition and also serve as camouflage.

The total length (including tail) of the different "Phelsuma" species varies between about , but the extinct Rodrigues giant day gecko was even larger. Day geckos have toe pads consisting of tiny lamellae which allow them to walk on plain vertical and inverted surfaces like bamboo or glass. The inner toe on each foot is vestigial. Males have well-developed femoral pores on the undersurface of their rear limbs. These pores are less developed or absent in females. Females often have well-developed endolymphatic chalk sacs on the sides of their necks. These sacs store calcium, which is needed for egg production. Those eggs can often be seen through the ventral surface of the female's body shortly before they are laid. The hatchlings reach sexual maturity between six and 12 months old. Smaller species may live up to 10 years, whereas the larger species have been reported to live more than 20 years in captivity.

Day geckos inhabit the islands of the south-west part of the Indian Ocean. The exceptions are "Phelsuma andamanense", which is endemic to the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal, and "Phelsuma dubia", which is also found on the East Coast of mainland Africa, although it possibly was introduced there. Most "Phelsumas" species are found in Mauritius and Madagascar. Some species are found on neighbouring island groups, including the Mascarenes, Seychelles, and Comoros. Due to human introduction, they are also often found on some of the Hawaiian Islands, including the Big Island and Kauai, and the state of Florida, where they were introduced as a form of pest control. The different "Phelsuma" species can be found from sea level up to 2,300 meters. Most day geckos are arboreal. They inhabit, amongst others, coconut palms and banana trees, but can also be found near human settlements, in gardens, on fences, houses, and huts. An exception, "Phelsuma barbouri", is a terrestrial species.

Day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates in the wild. They also eat nectar, pollen, and occasionally soft, ripe and sweet fruits such as bananas.

In captivity, such a diet is simulated. Insects which may be used include: (wingless) fruit flies, various flies, wax moths, crickets, small super worms, small butter worms and mealworms. Fruit, which is required a few times a week, may be small pieces of papaya, banana, or other sweet fruit and also commercial gecko nectars.

In 2008 a BBC film crew took footage of a day gecko successfully begging a planthopper for honeydew.

The genus "Phelsuma" was first described in 1825 by the British zoologist John Edward Gray, who named it after the Dutch physician Murk van Phelsum. The genus consists of about 70 known species and subspecies.

Two "Phelsuma" species ("Phelsuma gigas" and "Phelsuma edwardnewtoni") are now considered to be extinct, probably due to the destruction of their environments by human settlers and their domestic animals. Many day gecko species are endangered today because an increasing percentage of their natural habitat, especially tropical forest, is being destroyed by human activity.

"Nota bene": A binomial authority or trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species or subspecies was originally described in a genus other than "Phelsuma".

Coleonyx

Coleonyx is a genus of terrestrial geckos commonly referred to as banded geckos. Species of "Coleonyx" are found in the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central America. They are relatively small lizards, measuring about inches in total length (including tail). They are nocturnal and are found primarily in dry, rocky habitats.

Eublepharis

The genus Eublepharis, of which one known type is the leopard geckos, were first described by the British zoologist John Edward Gray in 1827. The etymology of their name is 'eu' = good (=true) |'blephar' = eyelid, and all have fully functional eyelids. Members of this genus are found in eastern and southwestern Asia where they reside in rocky grassland habitats. These geckos are sturdily built. Their tail is shorter than their snout-vent length and their body is covered with numerous wart-like bumps. The toes do not have adhesive lamellae or membrane ("Eublepharis" cannot climb like their other gecko cousins). "Eublepharis" are crepuscular or nocturnal ground-dwellers. Included in this group is the popular pet gecko: the leopard gecko. It is especially popular in the United States, where there are nearly 3 million captive bred leopard geckos. A common misconception about leopard geckos is that they live in dry, arid deserts, but they are from rocky grasslands in southwestern Asia, including northern India, Afghanistan and Pakistan. They avoid deserts and places with low water.

Leopard geckos hatch at a length of 6.5 to 8.5 cm (2.6 to 3.3 inches) and weighing approximately 3 grams. An adult of this species can reach a length of 20.5 to 27.5 cm (8.1 to 11 inches) and a weight of 54-65 grams. 

Leopard geckos have tough skin around their back, neck and head, well suited to move on rocky terrain in a dry environment. Like all reptiles, they shed this skin periodically to allow for further growth.

Leopard geckos eat only insects. Crickets, mealworms, waxworms, etc.


The members of the "Goniurosaurus kuroiwae" superspecies were formerly considered members of the genus "Eublepharis".

"Eublepharis" can be found throughout Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Northwest India, and Pakistan. They prefer dry, semi-dry, and more arid grassland regions.

Gonatodes is a genus of New World dwarf geckos of the family Sphaerodactylidae.

The majority of the species in the genus "Gonatodes" are diurnally active, scansorial, and sexually dichromatic, with adult body size (snout-vent length) ranging from for known species. 
The diets of the various species of "Gonatodes" are composed mainly of very small arthropods.

Clutch size is one, with most species producing several clutches per year, and some utilizing communal egg-laying sites.

Most species are humid tropical forest dwelling (some in warm lowlands, and others in somewhat cooler montane regions), with relatively fewer species utilizing more open, drier habitats at forest edge, tropical dry seasonal forest and scrub forest. Some species (usually those that use drier natural habitats) are able to utilize even more open human modified environments; in some cases including highly urbanized areas. "Gonatodes" usually spend most of their active hours perched anywhere from ground level to about 0.6 metres above ground (sometimes up to 2 or 3 metres) on vertical or near vertical surfaces of tree trunks, tree stumps, logs and sometimes rocks (as well as on walls and house-posts for those that are able to use human altered environments). They seldom sit exposed to direct strong sunlight (they do not appear to bask), and most seem to prefer shade or less exposure to direct sun light.

Species of "Gonatodes" are found in Central America including southern Mexico, a few Caribbean Islands (including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica and Union Island in St. Vincent and the Grenadines) and the northern part of South America, including Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname, parts of Brazil, Venezuela, the islands of Trinidad and Tobago, and some of the small islands just off the cost of northern South America.

Human mediated introductions have occurred with "Gonatodes caudiscutatus" in the Galapagos Islands and "G. albogularis" in Florida. In addition, some species have been transplanted by human activity to various regions within the general range of the genus where the particular species did not previously exist.

<doc id="323702" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=323702" title="Hemidactylus">
Hemidactylus

Hemidactylus is a genus of the common gecko family, Gekkonidae. It has 161 described species, newfound ones being described every few years. These geckos are found in all the tropical regions of the world, extending into the subtropical parts of Africa and Europe. They excel in colonizing oceanic islands by rafting on flotsam, and are for example found across most of Polynesia. In some archipelagoes, cryptic species complexes are found. Geckos like to live in and out of houses. They have been introduced to Australia.

The species are typically known as house geckos, due to their readiness to adapt to and coexist with humans, and can be easily encountered in human habitations. This genus was originally established by Lorenz Oken in 1817 for the species at that time known as "Hemidactylus tuberculosus", and now described as the tropical house gecko ("Hemidactylus mabouia").

The origin of the genus "Hemidactylus" is still unclear as the higher level phylogeny is not well resolved. Moreover, much of the diversity in this group still remains to be discovered.

A house gecko will usually confine its excretions to one area of a house. This is sometimes considered a nuisance by home owners, and may stain certain surfaces. The feces are approximately five (5) millimeters in length, two (2) millimeters wide, and dark brown (almost black) in color.

The dorsal lepidosis is either uniform or heterogeneous. The pupil of the eye is vertical. Males have pre-anal or femoral pores. Each finger or toe has a slender distal clawed joint, angularly bent and rising from within the extremity of the dilated portion.

The fingers and toes are free, or more or less webbed, and dilated; underneath they bear two rows of lamellae in a pattern resembling a paripinnate compound leaf. This leads to their other and more ambiguous common name, "leaf-toed geckos", used mainly for species from South Asia and its surroundings to prevent confusion with the many "leaf-toed" Gekkota not in "Hemidactylus".
Some members of the genus, such as "H. platyurus", are able to run quadrupedally across water by a partially surface tension-dependent mechanism distinct from the bipedal gait of basilisks.

The following phylogeny is from Pyron, "et al." (2013), and includes 47 "Hemidactylus" species. "Hemidactylus" is a sister group of "Cyrtodactylus".

<doc id="323767" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=323767" title="Uroplatus">
Uroplatus

Uroplatus is a genus of geckos, commonly referred to as leaf-tail geckos or flat-tailed geckos, which are endemic to Madagascar and its coastal islands, such as Nosy Be. They are nocturnal, insectivorous lizards found exclusively in primary and secondary forest.

The generic name, "Uroplatus", is a Latinization of two Greek words: "ourá" (οὐρά) meaning "tail" and "platys" (πλατύς) meaning "flat".

Geckos of the genus "Uroplatus" are nocturnal and arboreal. They range in total length (including tail) from about for "U. giganteus" to for "U. ebenaui". Larger species of "Uroplatus" are distinguished among geckos in having the largest number of marginal teeth among all living amniotes. Other rare apomorphic character states include multiple inscriptional ribs, restriction of autotomy planes, and finger-like diverticula of the lungs.

All "Uroplatus" species have highly cryptic colouration, which acts as camouflage, most being grayish-brown to black or greenish-brown with various markings resembling tree bark. There are two variations of this camouflage: leaf form, and bark form. The leaf form is present in a number of small-bodied species. All other forms blend in well with tree bark upon which they rest during the day. Some of these tree bark forms have developed a flap of skin, running the length of the body, known as a "dermal flap", which they lay against the tree during the day, scattering shadows, and making their outline practically invisible. These geckos bear a resemblance to geckos of the genera "Phyllurus" and "Saltuarius" of Australia. This is an example of convergent evolution.

The skull of "Uroplatus" is strongly ossified, with an extremely high tooth count and incipient secondary palate.

"Uroplatus" geckos are exclusively nocturnal. The larger species spend most of the daylight hours hanging vertically on tree trunks, head down, resting, while the smaller leaf tailed geckos ("U. phantasticus", "U. ebenaui", "U. finiavana", "U. malama", "U. fiera", "U. fotsivava", and "U. kelirambo") spend more time in bushes and small trees imitating twigs and leaves. They are all insectivores.

During their breeding season, female "Uroplatus" lay from 2-4 eggs depending on species and conditions.

"Uroplatus" are found in the herpetology and pet trade, but rarely. Most are threatened by deforestation and habitat loss. The difficulty in diagnosing between species has led to accidental exportation of both threatened and undescribed species.

Habitat destruction and deforestation in Madagascar is the primary threat to the future of "Uroplatus" geckos as well as collection for the pet trade. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) lists all of the "Uroplatus" species on their "Top ten most wanted species list" of animals threatened by illegal wildlife trade, because of it "being captured and sold at alarming rates for the international pet trade". It is a CITES Appendix 2 protected animal.

The genus "Uroplatus" has had a complex taxonomic history. However, the most recent and detailed study suggests there are at least 11 undescribed cryptic species in the genus, several of which have been described since its publication in 2013.

The following 19 species are recognised.

<doc id="323775" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=323775" title="Geckolepis">
Geckolepis

Geckolepis is a genus of geckos, commonly referred to as fish scale geckos, which are endemic to Madagascar and the Comoro Islands. They are nocturnal, arboreal, insectivorous lizards, found in primary and secondary forest, as well as degraded habitats. They are best known for their ability to lose their skin and scales when grasped by a predator.

The scales of "Geckolepis" are imbricated (overlapping) and ossified. Histological studies on the scales were performed as early as 1911 by Wilhelm Josef Schmidt. Schmidt noted the heterogeneity and imbrication of the scales, which makes meristics difficult on "Geckolepis". Schmidt noted that the imbrication of the scales was a result of their folding, essentially being bilayered rather than monolayered. He showed also that the scale centres are ossified, formed from irregular crystals, which he illustrated in some detail. In their micro-CT scans, Scherz et al. found that the scales of "G. megalepis" and other species have the same degree of x-ray attenuation as bone, and concluded that this suggested the presence of osteoderm as well. They noted that, like in Schmidt's illustrations, a zone toward the tip of the scales lacks ossifications as visible in micro-CT scans. Paluh et al. studied the osteoderm of "Geckolepis" cf. "maculata" using micro-CT and histology, and compared it to other geckos known to have osteoderm, namely "Gekko gecko" and "Tarentola mauritanica". They found that the osteoderms differ strongly from those of the other gecko species that possess them, and represent a third independent convergent derivation of osteoderm in geckos. The osteoderm of "Geckolepis" somewhat resembles that of the Gerrhosauridae or 'plated lizards'.

The scales of "Geckolepis" were known to come off already in the 19th century; Alfred Voeltzkow in 1983 described capturing specimens with bundles of cotton to avoid the scales coming off. Once lost, scales are regenerated, and eventually the regenerated scales are indistinguishable from original ones. The mechanism for this scale autotomy and the subsequent regeneration is not well understood, but was studied by C. Schubert and colleagues. These studies showed that it is not only the scales that are shed in the 'dermolytic autotomy' of "Geckolepis", but rather, there is a preformed splitting zone between the integument and the underlying connective tissue. They also showed that the dermolytic process is an active one, wherein a network of myofibroblasts in the splitting zone probably contract, followed by vasoconstriction to minimise blood loss. Their findings were questioned by Aaron M. Bauer and colleagues, but only based on comparative evidence from other geckos, which all have splitting zones within the integument, and not below it. Indeed, no subsequent studies have yet looked at this mechanism again, but there have been repeated calls for such investigation, especially as the regenerative properties may have relevance for human medicine.

The genus "Geckolepis" has difficult taxonomy due to variable pholidosis. Recent taxonomic and genetic investigation have shown that several cryptic species are present in this genus. Recently, Hawlitschek et al. (2016) resurrected "Geckolepis humbloti" from synonymy with "Geckolepis maculata", as a species endemic to the Comoro Islands. In 2017, Scherz et al. (2017) described "G. megalepis" from the limestone pinnacle karst formations of Ankarana National Park—this species has larger scales than all other members of the genus, but it was also identified based on its osteology. The taxonomic identity of "G. maculata" remains uncertain.

Calodactylodes is a genus of lizards, commonly called golden geckos, in the family Gekkonidae (geckos). The genus is distributed in peninsular India and Sri Lanka. Lizards in the genus "Calodactylodes" are primarily distinguished from other lizards by their characteristic, paired flower petal-like skin extensions on their fingers and toes.

The generic name, "Calodactylodes", created in 1928 by Embrik Strand, is a replacement name for Beddome's "Calodactylus". Replacement was necessary because when Richard Henry Beddome created "Calodactylus" in 1870, this name was already preoccupied by a genus of beetles which Émile Blanchard had named "Calodactylus" in 1850.

The following two species are recognized as being valid.


The Indian species, "C. aureus", is found in the Eastern Ghats hill range in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu states. The Sri Lankan species, "C. illingworthorum", is found in the Eastern Province, Sri Lanka.

Both species of "Calodactylodes" live in rock crevices, are nocturnal, insectivorous, and very social, living in colonies of multiple individuals. During breeding seasons, the dominant male acquires a brilliant golden yellow colour all over the body, and hence the common name. Females and young ones are drab brown, camouflaging among the rocks. These geckos are very vocal, and their loud rattling calls are often to be heard inside the dark ravines. They reproduce by laying eggs. Females are communal nesters and many may lay their eggs (often numbering in thousands) together simultaneously in a safe and suitable rock crevice, away from predators' reach.

"Christinus" was first described by Wells and Wellington in 1984, giving the types species as that published as "Diplodactylus marmoratus" Gray 1845. Their later proposal to establish a genus "Ridegekko", based on Boulenger's original description of "Phyllodactylus guentheri" ("C. guentheri"), is not given in later literature. 
The genus has been described as containing two species, the island population and the widespread southern population. The latter, "C. marmoratus", has two or more subspecies in its distribution range. One proposed subspecies, "Christinus marmoratus alexanderi" Storr, has been elevated by some authorities to the rank of species.

Cyrtodactylus

Cyrtodactylus (Greek κυρτος "kurtos" "curved", from κυπτω "kuptō" "to stoop"; δακτυλος "daktulos" "finger, toe") is a diverse genus of Asian geckos, commonly known as bent-toed geckos or bow-fingered geckos. It has at least 250 described species at present, which makes it the largest of all gecko genera.

Instead of possessing dilated digits like other geckos, members of "Cyrtodactylus" have slender, curved toes to which the common names for the genus can be attributed.

The phylogenetic relationships with this genus and the genus "Geckoella" has not been resolved to date. Based on morphology, suggested that it was a subgenus of "Cyrtodactylus" but a phylogenetic study by , though with inadequate sampling of taxa, restored it to generic status once again. All species of "Geckoella" have been placed here pending a more definitive study.

More than 250 species described. In 2019, six new species of the "Cyrtodactylus intermedius" complex were identified in the Cardamom Mountains and Associated Highlands region of Southeast Asia.

Ptenopus

Ptenopus is a small genus of lizards, known commonly as barking geckos, in the family Gekkonidae. The genus is endemic to Southern Africa. There are only three described species in this genus.

The following species and subspecies are recognized as being valid.

"Nota bene": A binomial authority or a trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species or subspecies was originally described in a genus other than "Ptenopus". 

The specific name, "carpi", is in honor of Dutch-born South African amateur naturalist Bernhard Karp (1901–1966).

The specific name, "kochi", is in honor of Austrian-born South African entomologist .

The genus "Ptenopus" is in several ways atypical of the family Gekkonidae. The toes have neither pads nor expanded tips; instead they have well developed claws and they are fringed with comb-like scales that assist in rapid motion over sand, and perhaps in digging. 
<br>The name "Ptenopus" is from classical Greek and means "feather-foot", referring to the fringes on the toes.

In build the body and tail are only moderately plump, roughly cylindrical without special frills. The tail tapers to a point, but as is common among geckos, it commonly has been partly shed by the time the animal is fully grown, and the distal part commonly is a regenerated replacement. The animal is of modest size for a gecko, typically in body length. The head plus tail add about a similar length, so that a typical specimen might measure roughly in total length. As in most geckos, the tail commonly is swollen with fat stores, but not as much so as most species, such as say, in the genera "Chondrodactylus" and "Pachydactylus".

The profile of the head is blunt, the snout being rounded, reminiscent of the genera "Chondrodactylus" and "Pachydactylus". The eyes are prominent and wide-set, sited distinctly far forward over the short muzzle, and they have vertical pupils without the pinholes to be seen in, for example, the pupils of many species of "Pachydactylus". The body and tail are cylindrical and the tail tapers to a point. The scales are small and granular and have no keels. The colour ranges from off-white or mottled yellow to chestnut brown, with irregular blotches and speckles. The ventral scales are generally white, but males of all species and females of "Ptenopus carpi" have yellow throats.

Barking geckos dig burrows up to a metre long. During the day they plug their burrows for protection from heat and predators. The name "barking gecko" refers to the territorial calls of males. During summer males sit at the mouths of their burrows in the dusk and on overcast days, and with only their heads showing, they call "kek-kek-kek" for hours on end. The call of each of the species has its own characteristic pitch. Apart from territorial defence, the calls attract females. A female that has chosen a mate will enter his burrow, and after mating she takes it over. He leaves and digs himself a new burrow. Usually she lays a single egg in such a burrow and leaves soon after. As is typical of geckos, the egg is hard-shelled.

Because of the importance of their burrows in their biology, barking geckos can only live in areas where they can dig their burrows. They depend on sand or silt that is fine enough, and firm enough to dig. Dunes of loose sand will not do, and neither will hard nor stony ground, nor thick grass. They prefer sparsely vegetated sandy soil, or silt in dry riverbeds. In suitable spots, they sometimes congregate densely, with many burrows in a small area. However solitary burrows are not unusual.

At night after rain showers, such as in the weather in which termites undertake their nuptial flights, barking geckos commonly leave their burrows to hunt actively for prey. During the brief season when the termites take to flight, they form an important part of the geckos' nutrition. At other times of the year, the geckos are mainly ambush predators, awaiting prey at the burrow entrance and sallying forth opportunistically.

Barking geckos are endemic to the arid western parts of Southern Africa. <br>"Ptenopus garrulus" has the largest geographic range, from Northern Cape, most of southern Namibia, and the southern half of Botswana, to northwest Limpopo.
<br>"Ptenopus carpi" occurs only in the Namib Desert from the Kuiseb River northwards to about opposite Etosha. <br> "Ptenopus kochi" occurs between the Kuiseb River southwards to Lüderitz.

Ptychozoon

Ptychozoon was a genus of arboreal geckos, endemic to Southeast Asia, known commonly as flying geckos, gliding geckos, or parachute geckos. They all are now placed in the genus Gekko in the family Gekkonidae. The biogeographic history of the genus "Ptychozoon" was deeply nested within that of the genus "Gekko", the center of diversity of which is within Southeast Asia. Since dispersing into Southeast Asian rainforests, "Pytochozoon", like other forest-dwelling vertebrates, adapted to facilitate gliding. All species in the genus "Ptychozoon" are characterized by cryptic coloration and elaborate webs surrounding the neck, limbs, trunk, and tail. These membranes help to conceal the gecko against trees. When the gecko leaps into the air, the flaps are used to generate lift and allow the gecko to control its fall. It can glide up to 200 feet (60 meters). Also it does a swoop at the end of its glide to land softly. A similar adaptation is found in geckos of the genus "Cosymbotus". There were thirteen described species in the genus "Ptychozoon".

The following species were recognized as being valid.

Hoplodactylus

Hoplodactylus is a genus of gecko endemic to New Zealand, one of the seven genera of geckos found only in New Zealand. "Hoplodactylus" comprises two species of large to gigantic brownish lizards, one extinct and one surviving only on predator-free islands.

Species in this genus (now spit into several genera) tend to have rather dull colouration with little variation on a generally brown/grey theme, although mottled greens are seen in some species, notably the forest gecko ("Mokopirirakau granulatus"). The one exception to this rule of general drabness in colouration is the striking "herring boned" colour pattern of green, brown, black and white that is displayed by the "Harlequin Gecko" ("Tukutuku rakiurae").

Although generally species of this genus cannot compete with those of "Naultinus" in terms of their vivid and beautiful colouration, "Hoplodactylus" species do have the ability to subtly change their skin colour pattern to give better camouflage, thus reducing the risk of predation. "In some of the Hoplodactylus species, the ability to change colour provides a supplementary method of thermoregulation"(*1). When basking in cold conditions they can darken their skin to increase the amount of heat absorbed and conversely they can lighten the shades in hot weather to reflect more light and keep cool. All species in this genus have more or less nocturnal activity patterns in contrast to the solely diurnal nature of "Naultinus" species and unlike species in the latter genus, are not purely arboreal and will forage on the ground.

"Hoplodactylus" species do not have "prehensile" tails and are thus generally less reluctant to drop them when disturbed by predators than species in the genus "Naultinus".

Many species of the genus "Hoplodactylus" also have toes that are broader and more expanded than do their relatives in the genus "Naultinus".

The key differences between New Zealand's two endemic gecko genera are summarised in the table below


"Hoplodactylus duvaucelii" is the largest species of gecko remaining in New Zealand, although due to predation by introduced mammals such as the brown rat their range is at present restricted to pest-free offshore islands.

The extinct kawekaweau/Delcourt's giant gecko "Hoplodactylus delcourti" was the largest known gecko in the world. It was first described in 1986, though the only known specimen was collected in the early 19th century but was overlooked in a French museum for more than a century.

Oedura is a genus of medium to large geckos, lizards in the family Diplodactylidae. The genus is endemic to Australia. Species in the genus are referred to by the common name velvet geckos.

Most of the species of "Oedura" occur in northern and eastern Australia, with further isolates in the arid zone (Pilbara, Central Ranges and Flinders Ranges).

Geckos of the genus "Oedura" are mostly arboreal and nocturnal, and have flattened bodies that are distinctly patterned. They are secretive tree or rock dwellers, usually concealing themselves beneath peeling bark or in cracks and crevices. A species found in the Kimberley region, "Oedura filicipoda", is named for the plumose fringing on the toes that may assist in clinging to rocky overhangs. All species are adapted to their dry conditions and can go for months without food or water.

The content of the genus "Oedura" has been reduced by Oliver et al. in 2012, when they transferred four species to the genus "Amalosia" and erected two new monotypic genera, "Hesperoedura" for "Oedura reticulata" and "Nebulifera" for "Oedura robusta".

Phyllurus is a small genus of Australian leaf-tailed geckos. Rarely seen outside their native habitat, they are notable for their highly effective camouflage which is in part aided by the spiny tubercles that cover every body part.

Most member species, except for "P. caudiannulatus", "P. gulbaru" and "P. kabikabi", have very flattened, leaf-shaped tails. Some of these species have recently been reassigned to the genus "Saltuarius". The "Phyllurus" geckos resemble the "Uroplatus" geckos of Madagascar. This is an example of convergent evolution because they are not closely related.

The following species are recognized as being valid.

The northern leaf-tailed gecko (previously "Phyllurus cornutus" , is now placed in the genus "Saltuarius".

"Nota bene": A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than "Phyllurus".

Rhacodactylus

Rhacodactylus is a genus of medium to large geckos of the family Diplodactylidae. All species in this genus are found on the islands that make up New Caledonia.

Genus characteristics include long limbs and toes with well-developed lamellae. Some webbing occurs on the hind limbs and toes. "Rhacodactylus" possess prehensile tails which also have lamellae to assist in climbing. These are for the most part arboreal geckos. "Rhacodactylus" are nocturnal geckos.

The species are egg layers with the exception of "Rhacodactylus trachyrhynchus" and "R. trachycephalus" which gives live birth, a characteristic only otherwise found in New Zealand geckos. They also feed on lizards, more so than any of the family. "Rhacodactylus" geckos are sexually dimorphic, with the males possessing larger preanal pores than the females as well as a distinct hemipenis pocket.

Males tend to be stockier than females with the exception of "R. auriculatus" in which species the males are much slimmer than the females.


A revision of the giant geckos of New Caldonia found weak support for inclusion of some taxa allied to this genus, and these have been assigned to new combinations: 

The species are regarded as charismatic and popular with herpetologists. Details of the behaviour of these geckos in captivity, contrasted with a paucity of field observations, has produced extensive literature on the genus.

Rhynchoedura, also known as the beaked geckos, is a genus of lizards in the family Diplodactylidae endemic to Australia. It includes six species:

The genus was regarded as monotypic, a single species named as "Rhynchoedura ornata" by Albert Günther in 1867. A second species was described in 1985, without widespread recognition, and in 2011 an extensive revision sampling the population across Australia found cryptic species and named four new taxa.

Saltuarius

Saltuarius is a genus of larger Australian geckos, known collectively as leaf-tailed geckos. The genus was created in 1993 to accommodate some former members of the genus "Phyllurus". These geckos appear very similar to the "Uroplatus" geckos native to Madagascar. However, this is a convergent evolution.

The genus name is derived from the Latin word "", meaning "keeper of the forest".

The species in the genus "Saltuarius" inhabit Australia's eastern coastal region, a vegetation composed of rainforests and dry Eucalyptus forests. "Saltuarius cornutus" and "Saltuarius swaini" are arboreal geckos, the remaining species live on rocky outcrops. They all need a high level of relative air humidity. The species from southern regions must hibernate for several months at temperatures varying between and .

These species invariably lay soft-shelled eggs which are buried in humid substrates.

The following seven species are recognized as being valid.

The former "Saltuarius occultus" , the long-necked northern leaf-tailed gecko, is now "Orraya occultus".

Underwoodisaurus

Underwoodisaurus is a small genus of Australian geckos, commonly known with the species "Uvidicolus sphyrurus" as thick-tailed geckos. The species Underwoodisaurus milii is often called the thick-tailed gecko.

The generic name, "Underwoodisaurus", is in honor of British herpetologist .

The genus "Underwoodisaurus" has a complex taxonomic history, but the currently accepted taxonomic concept follows & (2011), with a second species subsequently recognised by & (2011). Reptile systematists nowadays recognise a distinct family, Carphodactylidae, for this and some related genera.

Adults of some species can reach a snout-to-vent length of 80mm. Preanal pores are absent. The feet are generally "bird-like" with long slender digits, and the tail is carrot-shaped. The underside of the body is white, and the dorsal surface ranges from dark purplish-black through reddish-brown to pale fawn, with small white, yellow and black spots in patterns.

A thick tail is generally a sign of good health, although lack of thickness may indicate recent egg-laying.

The genus "Underwoodisaurus" is endemic to Australia. These geckoes are found in a range of habitats including wet coastal heathlands, wet sclerophyll forests, arid scrubland, rocky outcrops and stony hills in eucalypt woodland.

Thick-tailed geckos shelter under leaf litter, around the bases of trees in loose bark, and in crevices.

They emerge in the evenings to hunt in open areas for crickets, cockroaches and huntsman spiders. They eat once every 3–4 days. When they see prey they will stare at it and wag their tails, then pounce. 
When alarmed, the thick-tailed gecko will make a barking sound or hiss. They will also raise their backs. 
One main predator is snakes.

Thick-tailed geckos lay up to 2 eggs and up to 10 clutches per year. The first clutch of eggs is usually infertile. When the female is gravid the eggs are visible through the skin. The eggs take about 65 days to hatch. Their breeding season is roughly July to February.


"Nota bene": A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than "Underwoodisaurus". The species "Uvidicolus sphyrurus" is sometimes placed in the genus "Underwoodisaurus".

<doc id="324813" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324813" title="Bradypodion">
Bradypodion

Bradypodion (meaning "slow-footed" in Greek) is one of six genera of chameleons within the "true" or "typical" chameleons (Family Chamaeleonidae). They are native to southern Africa, and are sometimes collectively called South African dwarf chameleons. Some other small chameleons from eastern and central Africa are occasionally placed herein, but this is probably in error and not followed here. See also Systematics below and "Kinyongia" and "Nadzikambia".
Seventeen species are currently recognized:


Delimitation of "Bradypodion" has been controversial for some time. Most species seem readily distinguishable by morphological characteristics, but for some time the genus was used as a wastebin taxon for smaller chameleons from sub-Saharan Africa with plesiomorphic hemipenises. Alternatively, many of the present species were reduced to subspecies status. This has since been refuted, but several more species seem recognizable judging from morphological and mitochondrial 16S rRNA and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data.

The phylogeny and biogeography of this group is quite consistently resolved. The Cape dwarf chameleon and the Knysna dwarf chameleon (and possibly one new species close to it) are basal lineages with unclear relationships; they seem a bit closer to each other than to any other species, but altogether are quite distant. They occur in isolated ranges in coastal Western Cape and western Eastern Cape provinces. Inhabiting a wide range of habitats, they are (for the genus) large, and have brilliant, predominantly green coloration and long tails - just as in many "Chamaeleo". These characters are plesiomorphic, retained from the genus' ancestor.

The remaining species form a well-supported clade, which in turn can be divided into smaller groups. One consists of forms that radiated on the seawards slopes of the Drakensberg Mountains: the southern Drakensberg dwarf chameleon, the northern Transvaal dwarf chameleon, and what appears to be undescribed species from the Ngome Forest on the southeastern slopes. These are also plesiomorphic in "habitus" and habits.

Another group of taxa occurs from easternmost Eastern Cape to central KwaZulu-Natal provinces, between Gilboa Forest and the Tugela River. These inhabit a wide range of habitat and contain the plesiomorphic Natal Midlands dwarf chameleon from the namesake region, the small black-headed dwarf chameleon which inhabits fynbos and other low forest on slopes of mainly coastal KwaZulu-Natal, and another probable new species from the Gilboa Forest area. These appear to be a quite recent radiation from a single ancestor, and the group requires more research as regards species limits, and geographical demilitation from the Drakensberg dwarf chameleon.

Several largish but short-tailed and cryptic taxa inhabit more arid habitats such as karoo. The Karroo and southern dwarf chameleons seem to have considerable gene flow range from Northern Cape to coastal Eastern Cape provinces. The small and nearly extinct Smith's dwarf chameleon is close to these; it occurs on the escarpment inland from Jeffreys Bay. Less closely related is the Robertson dwarf chameleon, another aridland species which is found in Western Cape province inland from the range of the Cape dwarf chameleon and may be a cryptic species complex, and an undescribed population from the Swartberg Mountains. The last species with aridland apomorphies, the Namaqua dwarf chameleon, is quite distant to the others; it occurs in coastal regions from north of the Cape species through Namaqualand. This is probably still a part of a single radiation which brought about all the aridland taxa, and eventually Smith's dwarf chameleon.

The remaining species are all small inhabitants of forested slopes and fynbos, such as the black-headed and Smith's dwarf chameleons. However, as already indicated by the distinctness of these two, their morphologies seem to be a convergent adaptation. The Kentani and Transkei dwarf chameleons from the east coasts of Eastern Cape may or may not be each other's closest relatives. Setaro's dwarf chameleon from northeastern coastal KwaZulu-Natal is not close to these. The Zululand dwarf chameleon from western uThungulu apparently consists of two or more species, one that may be closer to the preceding, and one that might be an early offshoot of the ancestral Drakensberg stock, and which are distinguishable by morphological and mtDNA characteristics.

In conclusion, of the three basic morphotypes found in this genus, one (bright, long-tailed, large) is plesiomorphic, another (large, short-tailed, drab) apparently only evolved once, and the third (the small, slope-inhabiting forms) are convergent in morphology. The ancestors of "Bradypodion" thus were mid-sized chameleons with vivid color, which settled the Cape region from roughly north-northwestwards. Due to climate changes with fluctuating aridity, the basal lineages inhabiting humid fynbos in the southwest became isolated from each other and from the animals living around the border region between Northern and Eastern Cape and Free State, and Lesotho. The aridland habitat fluctuates in extent during climate shifts, and mountainous habitat becomes fragmented or consolidates accordingly. Consequently, the Drakensberg, the "B. thamnobates"-"B. melanocephalum", and the aridland group, as well as several coastal lineages, diverged and evolved to their present-day ranges and diversity.

Calumma

Calumma is a genus of chameleons endemic and restricted to Madagascar. The species formerly named "Calumma tigris" was transferred to the genus "Archaius" by Townsend et al. when they found that it is more closely related to "Rieppeleon" than to "Calumma".

Four species groups are recognised within the genus "Calumma" (originally proposed by Glaw & Vences in 1994), some of which may be only phenetic, while others are phylogenetically supported:

Contents: "Calumma furcifer, C. gastrotaenia, C. marojezense, C. guillaumeti, C. andringitraense, C. glawi, C. vencesi"

Species characterised by typically green body colouration, sleek body form, and generally no occipital lobes (flaps of skin posterior to the head; present only in "C. glawi") and no rostral appendage (present only in males of "C. furcifer").

Contents: "Calumma cucullatum, C. crypticum, C. amber, C. tsaratananense, C. hafahafa, C. hilleniusi, C. peltierorum, C. malthe, C. brevicorne, C. jejy, C. tsycorne"

Species characterised by distinct occipital lobes and generally a single bony rostral appendage that is larger in males than females.

Contents: "Calumma nasutum, C. fallax, C. gallus, C. guibei, C. boettgeri, C. linotum, C. gehringi, C. uetzi, C. lefona, C. juliae", "C. vatosoa, C. vohibola, C. peyrierasi, C. roaloko"

Species characterised by a soft dermal rostral appendage (generally present in males and absent in females). The following members possess occipital lobes: "C. guibei, C. boettgeri, C. linotum, C. gehringi, C. uetzi, C. lefona, C. roaloko," and "C. juliae." These taxa are collectively referred to as the "C. guibei" species complex. Occipital lobes are absent from all other species. The assignment of "C. peyrierasi" to this group remains a subject of uncertainty.

Contents: "Calumma globifer, C. ambreense, C. oshaughnessyi, C. parsonii, C. capuroni"

Species characterised by large body size, males with paired rostral appendages, and some species with small occipital lobes.

Brookesia

Brookesia is a genus of chameleons, endemic to Madagascar, that range from small to very small in size, and are known collectively as leaf chameleons (though this name also commonly is used for species in the genera "Rieppeleon" and "Rhampholeon"). "Brookesia" includes species considered to be the world's smallest chameleons, and are also among the smallest reptiles. Members of the genus "Brookesia" are largely brown and most are essentially terrestrial. 

A significant percentage of the species in the genus were only identified to science within the last three decades, and a number of species that still have not received a scientific name are known to exist. Most inhabit very small ranges in areas that are difficult to access, and due to their small size and secretive nature, they have been relatively poorly studied compared to their larger relatives.

The generic name "Brookesia" is in honor of British naturalist Joshua Brookes.

Most "Brookesia" are on CITES Appendix II, the only exception being "B. perarmata" on Appendix I (a species also listed as endangered by IUCN). Consequently, a special permit is required to import any of the below species from their native Madagascar, and typically no permit is issued for "B. perarmata".

Acanthosaura

Acanthosaura is a genus of lizards, commonly known as mountain horned dragons or pricklenape agamas, in the family Agamidae. The common name "pricklenape" refers to a row of dorsal spines which runs down the back of the neck. They are arboreal lizards found in Southeast Asia. They are medium-sized, their total length (including tail) ranging from about , depending on species and individual. As the common name "mountain horned dragons" implies, they tend to prefer higher elevation areas with dense vegetation.

Mountain horned dragons are insectivorous, consuming only live food. Common foods in captivity include crickets, earthworms, silkworms, mealworms, moths, roaches, wax worms, and grasshoppers. They require a variety in diet and will often refuse food when offered in excessive redundancy.

Typical "Acanthosaura" feeding behavior is a sit-and-wait style. They will perch off the ground until they spot their prey, which is often down on the ground. A display of aerobatics is not uncommon from "Acanthosaura" species when hunting food. They will eat and hunt fish, but most will not submerge their heads to catch a meal.

Females of the genus "Acanthosaura" lay their first clutch of eggs about four months after mating. They may lay up to four clutches total per year, separated by a month or two.

Mountain horned dragons are popular pets, and readily available in the exotic pet trade. "A. capra" is considered the hardiest and most easily kept species of the genus, and is the most common species found for sale in the United States. While not considered to be difficult to breed in captivity, most specimens available are wild caught.
However, due to captive breeding, more and more captive bred lizards are available.

Species in the genus "Calotes" are native to South Asia, southern China, mainland Southeast Asia and Ambon. Additionally, "C. versicolor" has been introduced to Florida (USA), Borneo, Sulawesi, the Seychelles, Mauritius and Oman. The greatest species richness of the genus is from the Western Ghats, northeast India, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

"Calotes" is distinguished from related genera in having uniform-sized dorsal scales, and lacking a fold of skin extending between the cheek and shoulder, and in having proportionately stronger limbs than "Pseudocalotes". Compared to "Bronchocela", "Calotes" have a proportionately shorter tail and limbs. "Calotes" as we know it today was classified by Moody (1980) prior to which all of the above-mentioned genera were included in this genus.

The genus "Calotes" is still a heterogeneous group that may be divided into the "C. versicolor" and "C. liocephalus" groups. The former occurs through most of South Asia and further east. All species in this group have their dorsal and lateral scales directed upward. The latter is restricted to the southern Western Ghats and Sri Lanka. All species in this group have their scales directed back, or up and down, or down only. Whether further splitting is necessary or whether the groups constitute subgenera of a monophyletic "Calotes" remains to be studied.

Lophognathus is a genus of lizards found in northern Australia extending south to the Murray-Darling Basin, New Guinea, and Tanimbar Islands. The five species are informally described as dragons, as are several genera in the family Agamidae, and closely related to those of "Amphibolurus".

"Lophognathus" species are slender, slightly compressed, agamid lizards that are often found in trees. They occur in a variety of habitat, including sand dunes and arid regions, but frequently near watercourses. Three species are endemic to Australia, "L. burnsi", "L. gilberti" and "L. longirostris"; "L. temporalis" is found in both Australia and New Guinea. The last species, "L. maculilabris", is endemic to the Tanimbar Islands (Timor Laut).

In Australia, these lizards are colloquially known as "Ta Ta" lizards, due to their habit of "waving" after running across hot surfaces.

The first description of a species in the genus "Lophognathus" was by John Edward Gray in 1842. The species he described, "Lophognathus gilberti", was named after English naturalist John Gilbert, the collector of the type specimen.

Male "Phoxophrys" have a tail that is swollen basally and is flattened above, whereas females have a cylindrical tail.

The genus "Phoxophrys" contains the following five species which are recognized as being valid.

"Nota bene": A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than "Phoxophrys".

Phrynocephalus

Phrynocephalus is a genus which includes 44 species of small and medium-sized agamid lizards, commonly called toadhead agamas or toad-headed agamas, that inhabit open arid and semiarid environments of Asia and Eastern Europe. The systematics of this genus are very complicated with many controversial points of view about the unclear phylogeny of this group. All representatives of this genus have adopted the so-called "sit and wait" hunting strategy and they actively use visual orientation when watching for food. In general, the ecological niche and role of "Phrynocephalus" species in lizard communities of arid environments of Asia are poorly studied, but seem to be similar to that of "Phrynosoma, Cophosaurus, Holbrookia, Uta", and "Sceloporus" in the New World, as well as "Moloch" in Australia.

The following 31 species are recognized as being valid.

Physignathus is a genus of large, diurnal, arboreal, agamid lizards from Asia, commonly known as water dragons. This genus name is Greek for "inflated jaw". The single species in this genus is the Chinese water dragon "P. cocincinus". The Australian water dragon was formerly included in "Physignathus" but recently this was placed in a distinct genus "Intellagama" as "Intellagama lesueurii". Water Dragons, especially "P. cocincinus", are sometimes kept as pets.

<doc id="326896" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=326896" title="Pogona">
Pogona

Pogonas are a genus of reptiles containing eight lizard species (though some sources say nine) which are often known by the common name bearded dragons. The name "bearded dragon" refers to the "beard" of the dragon, the underside of the throat, which can turn black for a number of reasons, most often as a result of stress.<ref name="https://beardeddragontank.com/8-reasons-for-your-bearded-dragons-black-beard"></ref> They are a semi-arboreal species, spending significant amounts of time on branches, in bushes, and near human habitation. "Pogona" species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons. They are found throughout much of Australia in a wide range of habitats such as deserts, shrublands and "Eucalyptus" woodlands.

Several species of this genus, especially the central bearded dragon, are often kept as pets. They can also be exhibited in zoos due to their hardy nature and easy care in comparison to other exotic reptiles.

The genus "Pogona" is in the subfamily Amphibolurinae of the lizard family Agamidae. Characteristics include broad, triangular heads and flattened bodies with spiny scales arranged in rows and clusters. These are found on the throat, which can be expanded when threatened, and at the back of the head. These scales are used to scare off predators, yet they are not very sharp. Bearded dragons display a hand-waving gesture to show submission (most often when acknowledging another bearded dragon's territory), and a head-bobbing display to show dominance between dragons. Some have the ability to slightly change colour during rivalry challenges between males, in response to ambient temperature changes such as turning black to absorb heat, and other stimuli. Males grow up to long, and females up to . Bearded dragons also produce a mild venom originating from primitive venom glands. Although generally harmless towards humans, it is effective towards smaller-sized animals.

Bearded dragons originate from deserts in Australia, with the various species occupying slightly overlapping areas of the landmass. They live in the arid and subtropical woodlands, scrublands, savannas, shore areas, and into the great interior deserts. Their range extends throughout the interior of the eastern states to the eastern half of South Australia and southeastern Northern Territory. They are considered to be semi-arboreal and will quite readily climb and bask at height. This is also linked to dominance behaviour and competition for territory/basking areas. They can be found on fallen/broken trees, rocky outcrops and bushes when basking.

Bearded dragons go through a type of hibernation called brumation. Brumation is like hibernation where reptiles go months without eating but they sporadically drink water. Reptiles go dormant in the hottest temperatures, but it differs from brumation during cooler temperatures. When temperatures are extreme, there is a very small range between temperatures that the reptile's bodies can stay active and where their body cannot tolerate the extreme heat and they die. Bearded dragons go through brumation when the temperature goes below 60–70  °F during the night and 75–80  °F during the day for eight to ten hours. When the climate is too hot they will often burrow underground. They will also form more permanent burrows or covered hiding places to use as protection from the climate changes at night and predation.

Adult bearded dragons are very territorial. As they grow, they establish social hierarchies in which displays of aggression and appeasement form a normal part of their social interactions.
A dominant male will adopt a dominant stance and sometimes ready himself for a fight to attack a male aggressor to defend territory, food sources or in competition for a female. Any approaching male will be seen as a challenge for the territory without displaying submissive behaviour. Aggressive males have also been known to attack females who do not display submissive gestures in return.

The bearded dragon comes in many different colors. The beard itself is used for both mating and aggression displays and forms part of a range of gestures and signals through which the dragons have basic levels of communication. Both sexes have a beard, but males display more frequently, especially in courtship rituals. Females also display their beard as a sign of aggression. The beard darkens, sometimes turning jet black, and inflates during the display. The bearded dragon may also open its mouth and gape in addition to inflating its beard to appear more intimidating. Extreme behaviour such as hissing can be observed when threatened with a predator, inflating the body and tilting towards the threat in defense. Bearded dragons have relatively strong jaws but will often only attack as a last resort when threatened outside of competition with their own species.

Head bobbing is another behaviour seen in both females and males; they quickly move their head up and down, often darkening and flaring their beard. Changes in the pace of head bobbing are thought to be a form of communication. Males head bob to impress females, and a male will often have to demonstrate his dominance when attempting to mate before the female will concede. Smaller males will often respond to larger males head bobbing by arm waving, which is a submissive sign. Females will also arm wave to avoid aggression, often in response to a male's head bobbing. Female bearded dragons have been seen lowering themselves towards the ground and intermittently arm waving whilst moving away from a dominant male in an attempt to either appease or escape.

When brumation comes to an end the male bearded dragon goes out to find a mate. A courtship ritual occurs where the male starts bobbing his head, waving his arms, and stomping his feet in front of the female. The male chases the female and will bite the back of her neck and hold on while he gets in position to copulate.

During the breeding period female bearded dragons can store sperm in the oviductal crypts. This allows the female bearded dragon to lay a clutch of 11–30 eggs twice from one mating.

When breeding bearded dragons, the incubation temperature can change the sex of the baby within the egg regardless of its sex chromosomes. If the eggs are incubated at a higher temperature (34 °C/93.2 °F and higher), the hatchlings will be female and when the eggs are incubated at a lower temperature (30 °C/86.0 °F and lower) they will be male.

During the development of an embryo, abnormalities may result in birth defects. These abnormalities might be caused by chromosomal disorders, chemicals, or other genetic or environmental factors.


The following eight species are recognised as being valid.

"Nota bene": A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described under a different binomial.

Bearded dragons are kept as pets. The central bearded dragon is the most common species in captivity, with some smaller species such as "Pogona henrylawsoni" being used as substitutes where there is less housing space available.

Introduced into the U.S. as pets during the 1990s, bearded dragons are a species that have gained much popularity as an exotic pet. This popularity has been sustained, even after Australia banned the sale of its wildlife as pets in the 1960s. 
Generally speaking, the bearded dragon is a solitary animal. Male bearded dragons are usually housed alone, as they will fight with other males and breed with females. Captive adults reach about from head to tail, weigh and live for about 10 to 12 years with good care. They have been known to live up to about 14 years in captivity, and the current world record is 18 years.

Through selective breeding, there are many different versions of the Central Inland Bearded Dragon; these are referred to as “Morphs”.
There are a few main genetic traits, Hypomelanism and Translucents, which refer to traits physically displayed by the dragon. Hypomelanism (or Hypo's) tend to have more vibrant colouration and lighter colours as well as very light brown/see through claws.
Translucents (or Trans) have a slightly opaque quality to their skin, making their colours seem stronger, and also have black eyes. 
There are also “Leatherbacks” (reduced scale texture to give a smoother skin), “Silkbacks” (Highly reduced scale texture and very soft outer skin) and “German Giants” (noticeably larger than your average bearded dragon)
Silkbacks in particular require special care as they have far more delicate skin and as such require different UV and humidity requirements. They also tend to live shorter lifespans.

Added to this there are various patterns, such as “Tiger”, and colour types, such as “Citrus” (yellows and greens), “Oranges” and “Reds”; there are also more extreme morphs that have been bred such as “Witblits” (Light Grey/Smokey), “Paradox" (the colouration has patches where grey/purple patches appear instead of its normal skin colour) and “Zeros” (Smokey Grey with purple tints and almost see-through skin).

Over the years, many different breeders have selective bred certain lines to emphasis these traits and will often name their own such as "Dunner", “Rainbow Tigers”, “Sandfire” or “Fire & Ice”, all with either their own colouration, patterns or physical traits.

Juvenile and baby bearded dragon diets consist mainly of insects, and they require substantial amounts of protein. A juvenile bearded dragon eats insects three times a day on average. After a few feedings the dragon's usual appetite can be determined. Crickets and dubia roaches are the most popular insects fed to bearded dragons, but they can also be fed other insects such as black soldier fly larvae, spiders, locusts, superworms, silkworms, butterworms, fruit flies, grasshoppers and hornworms. Bearded dragons also eat increasing amounts of plant-based food as they grow; adults should have a diet consisting primarily of plant matter, the most important of which are leafy greens. Spring greens, endive, kale, rocket, Chinese leaf and watercress are all suitable vegetables, as are butternut squash, pea shoots, bell peppers and many other plants. It is important to check before feeding something new to a bearded dragon, as some things can be toxic to them or will act to bind calcium in their diet, preventing them from being able to absorb calcium. This diet is also seasonal, meaning that it changes with availability of live prey in the wild. Studies of wild Pogona vitticeps have shown that termites compose over 60% of the stomach contents of those studied. Bearded dragons, like many reptiles, are opportunistic and will binge feed on live food sources where available, preferring live prey over plant matter.

Although bearded dragons are fairly resilient to illness, improper care can potentially fatally hurt a bearded dragon. Some health issues that bearded dragons may have include: metabolic bone disease, atadenovirus, impaction, prolapsation, and parasites. The majority of health issues bearded dragons face in captivity are due to poor diet and inadequate heat and lighting.

Metabolic bone disease (MBD) is a collective term for several common diseases/illnesses that can be fatal for bearded dragons. A main attribute of MBD is weakening of the skeletal structure and possible deformation. It occurs in bearded dragons due to malnutrition or the use of improper lighting, meaning they are unable to properly assimilate calcium from their diet or there isn't enough in their diet. Most bearded dragons in captivity will be fed supplementation and all will need a UVB light to enable them to properly use calcium in their diet. Typical foods that bearded dragons eat, including kale, mustard greens, and collard greens, are high in calcium and should be eaten daily along with other leafy greens and vegetables to have a well balanced diet Bearded dragons require UVB lights to process calcium in their diet. Without processing this calcium, their bodies will use calcium from their bones, therefore weakening them. Symptoms seen in bearded dragons with MBD include bumps in the legs, twitches or tremors, bumps along the spine or tail, a swollen bottom jaw, and jerky movements.

Hypocalcemia occurs when there are low levels of calcium in the bearded dragon's blood. Hypocalcemia is most often tied to metabolic bone disease. Low levels of calcium can result in twitching muscles, or seizures. Hypocalcemia is most often seen in young bearded dragons, as they are slightly more fragile than adults. Maintaining a diet which consists of enough calcium is crucial to avoiding hypocalcemia as well as metabolic bone disease.

Impaction occurs often in bearded dragons when they are fed food that is too big for them. Bearded dragons will try to eat worms or crickets that are too big for them, but this can be extremely harmful. Food should not be bigger than the space between their eyes for a young dragon. Older dragons can generally cope with larger insects but not oversized prey. If a dragon eats food that is too big for it, pressure will be put on its spinal cord during digestion. This pressure can lead to Impaction which can lead to death.

Atadenovirus (ADV), also referred to as adenovirus, is a viral disease that can be deadly. ADV can be spread between reptiles through contact alone. Most juvenile ADV-positive bearded dragons don't live past 90 days. While ADV-positive adults will live longer, they eventually contract liver diseases. Common symptoms of ADV-positive bearded dragons include stunted growth and slow weight gain. Because of their compromised immune systems, ADV-positive bearded dragons may be infected with intestinal parasites.

Bearded dragons require UVB to enable Vitamin D3 synthesis and to prevent illnesses like metabolic bone disease. Vitamin D3 is essential to calcium absorption, with calcium playing a major role in various critical biological functions. Bearded dragons also require UVA; this wavelength stimulates feeding, breeding, basking and overall health.
They also require a basking heat source, most commonly a light emitting source, to provide a basking area. Heat and UV are both vital to the bearded dragons' biological function.

In the wild, a bearded dragon may live up to 12 years, if not eaten as prey.

Pseudocalotes

Pseudocalotes is a genus of agamid lizards endemic to Southeast Asia.

"Pseudocalotes" was disassociated from the genus "Calotes" by Moody (1980). "Pseudocalotes" is distinguished from "Calotes" in having weak limbs, as may be noted in one of the species named "brevipes". It is distinguished from the "C. versicolor" group in having mixed orientation of dorsal scales, and lacking spines on the head. It is distinguished from "Bronchocela" in lacking a cheek skin fold, and in having short weak limbs. "Pseudocalotes" species do not have any enlarged compressed set of scales behind the orbit.

"Pseudocalotes" does not occur west of Sumatra and might occur in the Isthmus of Kra and Myanmar. A specimen was reported from N.E. India in the past though never verified.

Rankinia

Rankinia is a genus containing three species of small agamid reptiles, commonly known as heath dragons, found in Australia.

These dragons occur in heathlands, sandplains, and wooded country in southern regions of Australia. They are pale in colour, usually grey-brown, although males develop a reddish hue in the breeding season. This allows them to blend with their habitat; they are a ground-dwelling species found amid leaf litter and sand. "Rankinia" species are timid in their behaviour, and will only briefly break from the cover of vegetation. Their burrowing behaviour is unique in Australian dragons; they cover all but their snouts with a shuffling action, burying themselves in the sand; this behaviour may help the dragons to regulate their temperature.

Three species are contained by the genus, and subspecies of these have also been described:
Many of the subspecies are restricted to a small range. Their distribution in southwest Australia is represented by two subspecies of "Rankinia adelaidensis"; one at the western coast, another along the southeast coast of the region. A third subspecies, "Rankinia parviceps butleri" is found in a small range near Shark Bay and Dirk Hartog Island.

<doc id="326904" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=326904" title="Salea">
Salea

Salea is a genus of arboreal, slow-moving, diurnal, insectivorous, egg-laying agamid lizards endemic to the Western Ghats of South India. It has two species, each inhabiting very high mountainous tracts of the Western Ghats in the Shola forest ecosystems.

These lizards rely on their camouflage to escape from predators and to stalk prey. When detected or approached, many turn around twigs or freeze motionlessly to evade notice.

Albert Günther, in his treatise "The Reptiles of British India", described "Salea" as follows:

The tympanum naked. Back and sides covered with strongly keeled scales of moderate size; several larger scales are intermixed with the others on the side; the scales form longitudinal series, and their tips arc directed backwards; bead without any spines. A crest on the back; gular sac: none. Tail slightly compressed at the base, with keeled scales below, which arc almost as broad as long. The head is tetrahedral, covered with small irregular shields above, which are nearly as large as the labials. Nostrils lateral, in the hinder part of a small shield. "Canthus rostralis" is very distinct; superciliary edge not prominent; eye of moderate size; tympanum as large as the eye. The trunk is slightly compressed, and covered with scales of moderate size which are sharply keeled and acutely pointed, the keels forming continuous longitudinal lines; the ventral and gular scales are similar in shape and size to those on the sides. There arc three larger scales, separate from one another, and placed in the same longitudinal line somewhat below the middle of the sides. Throat without pouch or fold; dorsal crest more or less developed. Tail long, tapering, slightly compressed at the base, uniformly covered with rhombic keeled scales, those at its lower side having very strong keels. The limbs are well developed; the fourth hind toe is not much longer than the third.

There are only two confirmed species of Salea. 

The Palakkad Gap is believed to have played a significant role in causing speciation of these lizards on these mountain tops.

A doubtful 'third' taxon "Salea gularis" is often associated with this genus.

Sitana is a genus of lizards, collectively known as the fan-throated lizards, from the family Agamidae. They are found in Nepal, India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The genus comprises thirteen species, including several recently discovered species, such as two new species from Sri Lanka. In 2016, a new genus named "Sarada" was erected, consisting of one former "Sitana" species and two newly described ones. "Sarada" is the sister genus of "Sitana". Together they form a clade which sister group is "Otocryptis".

"Sitana" are small to medium-sized lizards. They are ground dwellers, primarily eating insects but also mollusks and plant seeds.

Males measure and females in snout–vent length. Males have prominent dewlaps which are used in communication during the breeding season. The dewlap may be small to large, depending on the species. Females lack the dewlap.

The genus "Tympanocryptis" has the following characters. The tympanum is hidden. The body is depressed, and it is covered dorsally with heterogeneous scales. There is no dorsal crest. There is no gular sac, but a strong transverse gular fold is present. The tail is round in cross section. There is a preanal pore on each side, which sometimes is absent in females. In most species there are no femoral pores, "Tympanocryptis tetraporophora" being an exception.

The following 17 species are recognized as being valid.


Several members of the "T. lineata" species complex (namely the Canberra population of "T. lineata, T. mccartneyi", "T. osbornei", and "T. pinguicolla") are referred to as the "grassland earless dragons", being the only members of the family Agamidae to be restricted to natural temperate grasslands. These species are found at higher altitudes and in regions that have cooler temperatures than any other earless dragon, where they prefer sites with both taller tussock and shorter grasses. The species were formerly considered different isolated populations of "T. pinguicolla", until a 2019 study found the Canberra population to actually be an isolated eastern population of "T. lineata" and the Cooma and Bathurst populations to represent distinct species, and thus restricted the definition of "T. pinguicolla" to refer to only the possibly-extinct Victoria population.

The grassland earless dragons lay 3-6 eggs in late spring or early summer. Their young hatch in late summer (possibly disperse soon after hatching), grow to adult size rapidly (by late autumn-early winter), mate the following spring, and often die within one year of birth. They can reach the age of 5 within captivity.

All of the grassland earless dragons are highly endangered due to the heavy destruction and conversion of the temperate grasslands, of which less than 1% are said to remain. Overgrazing poses one of the most significant threats to them, especially when rocks are disturbed. These species are rarely found outside native temperate grasslands, and does not adapt well to changed environments, primarily due to the lack of food diversity found outside their native habitat. "T. pinguicolla" may already be extinct due to the heavy degradation that grasslands have received in Victoria, with the last known confirmed sighting being made in 1969.

According to herpetologist Lyn S. Nelson, "Observations indicate that arthropod burrows, surface rocks, or other similar refuge sites may be necessary for the continued persistence of populations of dragons, by providing thermal refugia." They are known to hide within abandoned arthropod burrows and underneath rocky outcrops in order to lay eggs and protect themselves from predators. Soil disturbance, such as ploughing or compaction, might also result in destruction of the essential arthropod burrows and possibly a reduction in the abundance, at least in the short-term, of burrow forming arthropods. A radio-tracking study found that "burrows excavated by arthropods are an important resource for grassland earless dragons, with individuals having one or two home burrows around which they maintained home ranges of between 925 m and 4768 m." According to Nelson, they "[m]ay survive short-term disturbance from fire." 

In early January 2014, media reported that researchers Professor Stephen Sarre and Dr Lisa Doucette from the University of Canberra's Institute for Applied Ecology had succeeded in breeding the Canberran "T. lineata" in captivity, and had also hatched eggs gathered from field studies, with around 60 hatchlings being born. In June 2011, Professor Sarre's team won a four-year funding grant from the Australian Research Council to research and potentially save the species from extinction, and find a cause for the species recent collapse in numbers, thought to be associated with 10 years of drought in the species' range. In 2019, ecologist Brett Howard from the ACT Parks and Conservation Service said that "grassland earless dragons are at risk of extinction in the near future even though much has been done to improve their survival chances in the past five years." He then listed the threats posed to this species, saying "this species has suffered declines in recent decades likely due to a combination of drought, overgrazing and climate change.”

<doc id="326914" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=326914" title="Uromastyx">
Uromastyx

Uromastyx is a genus of African and Asian agamid lizards, the member species of which are commonly called spiny-tailed lizards, uromastyces, mastigures, or dabb lizards. Lizards in the genus "Uromastyx" are primarily herbivorous, but occasionally eat insects and other small animals, especially young lizards. They spend most of their waking hours basking in the sun, hiding in underground chambers at daytime or when danger appears. They tend to establish themselves in hilly, rocky areas with good shelter and accessible vegetation.

The generic name ("Uromastyx") is derived from the Ancient Greek words "ourá" (οὐρά) meaning "tail" and "-mastix" (μάστιξ) meaning "whip" or "scourge", after the thick-spiked tail characteristic of all "Uromastyx" species.

The following species are in the genus "Uromastyx". Three additional species were formerly placed in this genus, but have been moved to their own genus, "Saara".



Their size ranges from ("U. macfadyeni") to or more ("U. aegyptia"). Hatchlings or neonates are usually no more than in length. Like many reptiles, these lizards' colors change according to the temperature; during cool weather they appear dull and dark but the colors become lighter in warm weather, especially when basking; the darker pigmentation allows their skin to absorb sunlight more effectively.

Their spiked tail is muscular and heavy, and can be swung at an attacker with great velocity, usually accompanied by hissing and an open-mouthed display of (small) teeth. Uromastyxes generally sleep in their burrows with their tails closest to the opening, in order to thwart intruders.

"Uromastyx" inhabit a range stretching through most of North and Northeast Africa, the Middle East, ranging as far east as Iran. Species found further east are now placed in the genus "Saara". "Uromastyx" occur at elevations from sea level to well over . They are regularly eaten, and sold in produce markets, by local peoples. "Uromastyx" tend to bask in areas with surface temperatures of over .

A female "Uromastyx" can lay anywhere from 5 to 40 eggs, depending on age and species. Eggs are laid approximately 30 days following copulation with an incubation time of 70–80 days. The neonates weigh and are about snout to vent length. They rapidly gain weight during the first few weeks following hatching.

A field study in Algeria concluded that Moroccan spiny-tailed lizards add approximately of total growth each year until around the age of 8–9 years.

Wild female uromastyx are smaller and less colorful than males. For example, "U. (dispar) maliensis" females are often light tan with black dorsal spots, while males are mostly bright yellow with mottled black markings. Females also tend to have shorter claws. In captivity female "U. (dispar) maliensis" tend to mimic males in color. Maliensis are, therefore, reputably difficult to breed in captivity.

These lizards acquire most of the water they need from the vegetation they ingest. In the wild they generally eat any surrounding vegetation. When hatching, baby uromastyx eat their own mother's feces as their first meal before heading off to find a more sustainable food source. 

Captive uromastyxs' diets should be largely herbivorous, consisting primarily of endive, dandelion greens, bok choy, escarole, and most ground growing vegetables with little to no sugar, or of course an appropriate type of store-bought vegetarian lizard food. Some lettuces have almost no nutritive value. The lighter, whiter lettuce is not as nutritionally effective as the darker green lettuce. It is very important to avoid spinach, chard and flowering kale in the diets of all reptiles, since the oxalates in spinach prevent the uptake of calcium into the bloodstream. However, a special UVB bulb must be used in order for them to absorb the calcium from the gut. They can consume de-thorned cacti with their powerful jaws, especially if they need water. The lizards' food can be dusted with a calcium and a uromastyx designed supplement to help prevent health problems. While young uromastyx, like young iguanas, do eat some insects in order to gain access to the added nutrients while they are rapidly growing, the high levels of protein may cause liver damage in adults. These animals are primarily herbivores, as stated above, and so it is generally felt that they should only be fed plant matter. In the wild, adult Malis have been reported to eat insects at certain times of the year, when it is hot and their only food source available would be insects.

"Uromastyx maliensis", known as "ḍabb" () by peninsular Arabs, is consumed as food by the Bedouin populations of the Arabian peninsula, mainly those residing in the interior regions of Saudi Arabia. This lizard is considered a "bedouin delicacy". It is recorded that when an "Uromastyx" was brought to the Prophet Muhammad by Bedouins, the Prophet did not eat the lizard but Muslims were not prohibited by him from consuming it, thus the Prophet's companion Khalid bin Walid consumed the lizard.

Historically, captive "Uromastyx" had a poor survival rate, due to a lack of understanding of their dietary and environmental needs. In recent years, knowledge has significantly increased, and appropriate diet and care has led to survival rates and longevity approaching and perhaps surpassing those in the wild.

The Mali Uromastyx ("Uromastyx (dispar) maliensis") is considered an ideal species of Uromastyx to choose as a pet because they readily adapt to a captive environment. Another species that adapts to captivity well, and comes in "red" and "yellow", is "Uromastyx geyri", commonly called the Saharan Uromastyx. The red version is marketed as a red Niger Uromastyx but the yellow version is marketed as a yellow Niger Uromastyx. Artificial UVB/UVA light and vitamin supplements must be balanced with proper food and nutrition, UVB light is required for calcium absorption from the gut. Most commercially available UVB lights lose efficiency after 6 months and need to be replaced. Proper enclosures can be costly, as these are roaming animals with large space needs for their size, combined with the need to provide heat and ultraviolet light. Though the lizards bask at very high temperatures, there must be a temperature gradient within the enclosure allowing them to cool off away from the heat lamps. A cooling-down period over winter months can trigger the breeding response when temperatures rise in the spring. The temporary slowing-down of their metabolisms also lengthens the animals' lifespans.

Uromastyx are removed from the wild in an unregulated manner for the pet and medicinal trade in Morocco, despite their protected status in the country. Conditions of the animals while being sold is often extremely poor and overcrowding is common.

"Uromastyx" are burrowing lizards, and need substrate deep enough to burrow in, or a low structure under which to hide. In the wild, these lizards' burrows can reach in length.

Brachylophus

The genus Brachylophus consists of four extant iguanid species native to the islands of Fiji and a giant extinct species from Tonga in the South West Pacific. One of the extant species, "B. fasciatus", is also present on Tonga, where it has apparently been introduced by humans.

The name, "Brachylophus", is derived from two Greek words: brachys (βραχύς) meaning "short" and lophos (λόφος) meaning "crest" or "plume", denoting the short spiny crests found along the backs of these species.

"Brachylophus" species are the most geographically isolated iguanas in the world. Their closest extant relatives (the genera "Amblyrhynchus", "Conolophus", "Ctenosaura", "Cyclura", "Iguana" and "Sauromalus") are present in primarily tropical regions of the Americas and islands in the Galápagos and Lesser and Greater Antilles. Several of these genera are adapted to xeric biomes. The location of members of "Brachylophus", so distant from all other known extant or extinct iguanids, has long presented a biogeographical enigma.

These iguanas have been hypothesized to have evolved from New World iguanas that rafted west across the Pacific Ocean with the aid of the South Equatorial Current. While a rafting voyage of four months or more might seem implausible, the ancestors of "Brachylophus" may have been preadapted for such a journey by having water requirements that can be satisfied by food alone, as well as comparatively long egg incubation periods.

An alternative hypothesis to account for this biogeographical puzzle, based in part on an estimated divergence date of 50 million years ago, is that these species are the descendants of a more widespread but now extinct lineage of Old World iguanids that migrated overland from the New World to Asia or Australia, and then dispersed by some combination of continental drift, rafting and/or land bridges to their present remote location. However, no other fossil or extant species of this putative lineage have been found to date in Southeast Asia, Australasia or the western Pacific outside of Fiji and Tonga.
The extant species are:
Historically, only the first two were recognized, but "B. bulabula" ("bulabula" is the Fijian word for "healthy" or "flourishing") was described in the central regions of Fiji by a team led by a scientist from the Australian National University in 2008. Detailed genetic and morphological analyses were made to conclude that "B. bulabula" represents a third species. In 2017, "B. gau" was described as a new species from Gau Island.

A giant Tongan species, "Brachylophus gibbonsi", similar in size and build to an iguana of the genus "Cyclura" once existed on Lifuka, islands in the Ha‘apai group and Tongatapu but became extinct in prehistoric times due to predation by humans and their domestic animals. An even larger extinct iguana of the separate genus "Lapitiguana" was formerly present on Fiji.

Ctenosaura

Ctenosaura is a lizard genus commonly known as spinytail iguanas or ctenosaurs. The genus is part of the large lizard family, Iguanidae and is native to Mexico and Central America. The name is derived from two Greek words: ctenos (κτενός), meaning "comb" (referring to the comblike spines on the lizard's back and tail), and saura (σαύρα), meaning "lizard".

The species range in size (total length, including the tail) from about to well over . The distinctive feature of this genus is the presence of enlarged, spiny scales on the tail.

Ctenosaurs are generally omnivorous, feeding on fruits, flowers, foliage, and small animals.

"C. similis" and "C. quinquecarinata" are popular as pets.

At least two species, "Ctenosaura pectinata" and "Ctenosaura similis", have been introduced into southern areas of Texas and Florida.

The world record sprint speed for lizards (21.5 miles/h or 34.6 km/h) was attained by the Costa Rican spiny-tailed iguana, hence the nickname "Iguana" from the jungle guard Andrés Pmorado ("Ctenosaura similis").

The genus "Ctenosaura" represents the most diverse group of iguanas with 13 currently recognized species and at least two unrecognized species. These species inhabit lowland dry forests, below elevation, on both coasts of Mexico and Central America. All species of "Ctenosaura" fall within one of seven clades. Distributions of these clades fall geographically within well established areas. Closely related species show allopatry whereas species from divergent clades show sympatry.

<doc id="334376" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=334376" title="Curly-tailed lizard">
Curly-tailed lizard

The curly-tailed lizards belong to the family Leiocephalidae. One of the defining features of these lizards is that their tail often curls over. They were previously regarded as members of subfamily Leiocephalinae within the family Tropiduridae. There are presently 29 known species, all in the genus "Leiocephalus".

The curly-tailed lizards are native to the West Indies, with the extant (living) species in the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, Cayman Islands, Cuba, Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and nearby small islands. Additionally, "Leiocephalus carinatus" and "Leiocephalus schreibersii" have been introduced to Florida.

The curly-tailed lizards vary in size depending on species, but typically are approximately in snout-to-vent length. These lizards have no femoral pores, pterygoid teeth, or palatine teeth. Additionally, these lizards are observed to have overlapping scales.

The curly-tailed lizards mostly forage on arthropods like insects, but also commonly take flowers and fruits. Large individuals will eat small vertebrates, including anoles.

As suggested by their name, most species of this family often lift their tail and curl it. This is done both when a potential predator is present and when not present, although in some curly-tailed lizard species it increases when one is present. It shows the fitness of the lizard to a would-be predator and—in the case of an attack—draws attention to the tail, which increases the lizard's chance of escaping. Although it has been suggested that it also functions as a territorial display, studies have been unable to find support for this, as the tail curling does not change when another member of the same species is present.

The conservation status of the species in this family varies greatly. Several species, for example "Leiocephalus carinatus", are common and widespread. Others are rare and highly threatened, especially those restricted to a single small island or a single location on a larger island, like the critically endangered "Leiocephalus (barahonensis) altavelensis" from Alto Velo Island and critically endangered "Leiocephalus onaneyi" from Guantánamo Province in Cuba. Primary threats to their survival are habitat loss (for example, expanding agriculture, charcoal production and grazing goats) and introduced predators (for example, small Indian mongoose). Several species are already extinct. Some of these are only known from fossil or subfossil remains and became extinct in the Pleistocene or pre-Columbian era, but others survived into recent history. Three species, "Leiocephalus endomychus", "Leiocephalus pratensis" and "Leiocephalus rhutidira", have not been seen since the 1960s and 1970s and are recognized as critically endangered, possibly extinct, by the IUCN. They are among the "most wanted" EDGE species.

Lizards of this family are diurnal and mostly inhabit fairly open habitats in a generally well-studied part of the world. Consequently, the majority of the species and subspecies already were scientifically described several decades ago. In 2016, the first new curly-tailed lizard since the early 1980s was described. The species was found in the coastal dunes of Bahía de las Calderas in the southwestern Dominican Republic. This species differs from the rest within Leiocephalidae in that its bony parietal table is U-shaped versus V-shaped, the males have 3-4 enlarged post-postcloacal scales versus 2, and there are specific sexual dimorphism trails.

The following species and subspecies, listed alphabetically by scientific name, are recognized as being valid by the Reptile Database.

Its Malagasy relatives are the iguanians of the genus "Oplurus".

Two species of "Chalarodon" exist:
Members of this genus inhabit semi-arid to arid regions and almost entirely open, or very sparsely vegetated habitats with sandy soil in southern, western, and south eastern Madagascar.

The Madagascar sand lizards are insectivores. In addition to insects, sometimes plants are ingested, particularly in the form of leaves and roots.

During the mating season, males defend territories with threat displays and combat. Copulation is very brief, and females lay pairs of eggs between December and March.

Fringe-toed lizard

Fringe-toed lizards are lizards of the genus Uma in the family Phrynosomatidae, native to deserts of North America. They are adapted for life in sandy deserts with fringe-like scales on their hind toes hence their common name.

Lizards of the genus "Uma" have a brown and tan coloration that helps them to blend in with the sand. The dorsal surface has a velvety texture with intricate markings. In addition, they also have prominent elongated scales which form a fringe on the sides of their hind toes. These fringes aid with traction and speed, and help the lizard avoid sinking into loose, sandy dunes.

Fringe-toed lizards also possess upper jaws which overlap the lower ones, preventing the intrusion of sand particles, and nostrils that can be closed at will. Flaps also close against the ear openings when moving through sand, and the upper and lower eyelids have interlocking scales that prevent sand from getting into the eyes.

Fringe-toed lizards range throughout southeast California and southwest Arizona, and extend into northwest Sonora and northeast Baja California.

Lizards of the genus "Uma" are found in low desert areas having fine, loose sand.

Fringe-toed lizards primarily eat insects, including ants, beetles, grasshoppers, and caterpillars. Flower buds, stems, leaves and seeds of plants are also eaten.

Lizards of the genus "Uma" bury themselves underground in the winter. They sleep in their burrows, and use their burrows for protection from predators and extreme temperatures.

<doc id="334400" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=334400" title="Side-blotched lizard">
Side-blotched lizard

Side-blotched lizards are lizards of the genus Uta. They are some of the most abundant and commonly observed lizards in the deserts of western North America, known for cycling between three colorized breeding patterns and is best described in the common side-blotched lizard. They commonly grow to six inches including the tail, with the males normally being the larger sex. Males often have bright throat colors.

These lizards are prey for many desert species. Snakes, larger lizards, and birds all make formidable predators to side-blotched lizards. Larger lizard species, such as collared, leopard, and spiny lizards, and roadrunners are the main predators. In turn, the side-blotched lizards eat arthropods, such as insects, spiders, and occasionally scorpions.

As a result of their high predation rate, these lizards are very prolific breeders. From April to June they breed, with the young emerging as early as late May. These inch-long young appear all through the summer, and into September.

The diploid chromosome number in most if not all species is 34, consisting of 12 macro- and 22 microchromosomes.

Side-blotched lizards are notable for having the highest number of distinct male and female morphs within a species: three male and two female. They show a diversity of behaviors associated with reproduction, which are often referred to as "alternative reproductive tactics".

Orange-throated males are "ultra-dominant, high testosterone", who establish large territories and control areas that contain multiple females. Yellow stripe-throated males ("sneakers") do not defend a territory, but cluster on the fringes of orange-throated lizard territories, and mate with the females on those territories while the orange-throat is absent, as the territory to defend is large. Blue-throated males are less aggressive and guard only one female; they can fend off the yellow stripe-throated males but cannot withstand attacks by orange-throated males.

Orange-throated females lay many small eggs and are very territorial. Yellow-throated females lay fewer, larger eggs, and are more tolerant of each other.

This is called the rock paper scissors effect, borrowed from the name of the playground game, because the outcome of the mating success shows that one morph of the lizard takes advantage over another but not over the third.

The orange and blue-throated males can sometimes be seen approaching a human "intruder". One speculation is that he could be giving the female(s) a chance to escape, but whether he is defending the female has not been documented. Another speculation is that he is highly motivated to engage whenever he sees movement on his territory, which he may be interpreting as a possible intruding male, or another female.

The systematics and phylogeny of the side-blotched lizards is very confusing, with many local forms and morphs having been described as full species. Following the 1997 review of Upton & Murphy which included new data from mtDNA cytochrome "b" and ATPase 6 sequences, the following species can be recognized pending further research:


"Uta stellata" and "U. concinna" are now usually considered subspecies of "U. stansburiana". "U. encantadae", "U. lowei", and "U. tumidarostra" might be subspecies of a distinct species (Las Encantadas side-blotched lizard), instead. Similarly, "U. auriculata" and "U. clarionensis" might be subspecies of a single species, the Revillagigedo side-blotched lizard.

The specific name, "lowei", is in honor of American herpetologist Charles Herbert Lowe.

<doc id="334401" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=334401" title="Anolis">
Anolis

Anolis is a genus of anoles (), iguanian lizards in the family Dactyloidae, native to the Americas. With more than 425 species, it represents the world's most species-rich amniote tetrapod genus, although it has been proposed that many of these should be moved to other genera, in which case only about 45 "Anolis" species remain. Previously, it was classified under the family Polychrotidae that contained all the anoles as well as "Polychrus", but recent studies place it under Dactyloidae.

This very large genus displays considerable paraphyly, but phylogenetic analysis suggests a number of subgroups or clades. Whether these clades are best recognized as subgenera within "Anolis" or separate genera remains a matter of dispute. 

If the clades are recognized as full genera, about 45 species remain in "Anolis", with the remaining moved to "Audantia" (9 species), "Chamaelinorops" (7 species), "Ctenonotus" (more than 40 species), "Dactyloa" ( 95 species), "Deiroptyx" (almost 35 species), "Norops" ( 190 species) and "Xiphosurus" ( 15 species). Some of these can be further subdivided. For example, "Phenacosaurus" was often listed as a full genus in the past, but it is a subclade within "Dactyloa" ("Dactyloa heteroderma" species group). Among the subgroups within "Anolis" are: 


In 2011 the green (or Carolina) anole ("Anolis carolinensis") became the first reptile to have its complete genome published.

Closely related, recently diverged anole lizards exhibited more divergence in thermal biology than in morphology. These anole lizards are thought to have the same structural niche and have similarities in their size and shape. However they inhabited different climatic niches in which there was variability in temperature and openness of the environment. This suggests that thermal physiology is more associated with recently diverged anole lizards.

"Anolis" lizards are some of the best examples of both adaptive radiation and convergent evolution. Populations of lizards on isolated islands diverge to occupy separate ecological niches, mostly in terms of the location within the vegetation where they forage (such as in the crown of trees vs. the trunk vs. underlying shrubs). These divergences in habitat are accompanied by morphological changes primarily related to moving on the substrate diameter they most frequently encounter, with twig ecomorphs having short limbs, while trunk ecomorphs have long limbs.

In addition, these patterns repeat on numerous islands, with animals in similar habitats converging on similar body forms repeatedly. This demonstrates adaptive radiation can actually be predictable based on habitat encountered, and experimental introductions onto formerly lizard-free islands have proven "Anolis" evolution can be predicted.

After appearing on each of the four Greater Antillean Islands about 50 million years ago, "Anolis" lizards spread on each island to occupy niches in the island's trees. Some living in the tree canopy area, others low on the tree trunk near the ground; others in the mid-trunk area, others on twigs. Each new species developed its own distinct body type, called an ecomorph, adapted to the tree niche where it lived. Together the different species occupied their various niches in the trees as a "community". A study of lizard fossils trapped in amber shows that the lizard communities have existed for about 20 million years or more. Four modern ecomorph body types, trunk-crown, trunk-ground, trunk and twig are represented in the amber fossils study. Close comparison of the lizard fossils with their descendants alive today in the Caribbean shows the lizards have changed little in the millions of years.

The anolis lizards that are less susceptible to predation are those with a dewlap that has both the scales and the skin in between match the expected pale gray or white like color of its ventral surface.

<doc id="334402" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=334402" title="Norops">
Norops

Norops is the proposed genus for more than 150 species of anole lizards traditionally classified in the genus "Anolis". They are native to Mexico, South and Central America, and the West Indies. Depending on the exact species, adults have a snout-to-vent of between about , ranging from the small five-striped grass anole to the Jamaican giant anole.

The first recognition of this group happened in 1959–1960 when it was proposed that "Anolis" could be split into two groups, the so-called "alpha anoles" and "beta anoles". The former comprised most anole subgroups, while the latter essentially equalled "Norops". The "beta anoles" form a monophyletic group, but the "alpha anoles" do not. In 1986, the "beta anoles" were recognized as a genus, "Norops", while the "alpha anoles" were split into multiple genera (some of which had already been proposed earlier) based primarily on skeletal characters. This was adopted by some (including many scientists working with reptiles in Central America) and rejected by others (including many scientists in the West Indies), who continues placing all in "Anolis". Later studies confirmed that "Norops" was monophyletic, but a few of the other genera proposed in 1986 were not. A resolution to this was proposed in 2012 when "Anolis" was split into eight genera, including "Norops". This move was criticized, especially because some considered the change unnecessary when it was possible to maintain a "status quo" by keeping all anoles in the genus "Anolis". Later studies have confirmed that the genera proposed in 2012 essentially are monophyletic, but prefer to only treat them as clades within "Anolis".

There are three primary subclades within "Norops": The "N. auratus" group (""Draconura"") alone contains about 150 species, including the vast majority of anoles from Mexico and Central America, but also some from South America (as far south as Paraguay) and nearby small islands. The two remaining groups have far fewer species and are native to the West Indies. The "N. sagrei" group (""Trachypilus"") contains almost 20 species from Cuba and nearby small islands, as well as the Bahamas, Cayman Islands and Swan Island. The "N. valencienni" group (""Placopsis"") contains less than 10 species from Jamaica and Grand Cayman. Among these, the brown anole has been widely introduced to regions outside its native range, both in the Americas (including Florida and Texas) and other continents. The Graham's anole has been introduced to Bermuda.

"Norops" includes the following species:

Whether "Norops" is classified as a clade or a genus, most taxonomists have agreed on what morphological characteristics warrant the placement of a species inside the group. Etheridge classified his beta anoles as species that shared the certain aspects of vertebral morphology; Nicholson "et al." went further by defining "Norops" as species that shared the following specific aspects of skeletal morphology:


There is remarkable morphological variation within this clade, even relative to other clades in "Anolis"; however most "Norops" species share a set of similar characteristics that are readily observable even to the untrained eye; they are usually small to mid-size anoles, though a few species such as "Anolis (Norops) garmani" can grow much larger. They typically have robust bodies and stout, blunt heads; they exist in a variety of ecomorphs.

Microlophus

Microlophus is a genus of tropidurid lizards native to South America. There are around twenty recognized species and six of these are endemic to the Galápagos Islands where they are popularly known as lava lizards (they are sometimes placed in "Tropidurus" instead). The remaining, which often are called Pacific iguanas, are found in the Andes and along the Pacific coasts of Chile, Peru, and Ecuador.

The distribution of the lava lizards and their variations in shape, colour and behaviour show the phenomenon of adaptive radiation so typical of the inhabitants of this archipelago. One species occurs on all the central and western islands, which were perhaps connected during periods of lower sea levels, while one species each occurs on six other more peripheral islands. All have most likely evolved from a single ancestral species. However, as usual for Tropiduridae they can change their colour individually to some extent, and members of the same species occurring in different habitats also show colour differences. Thus animals living mainly on dark lava are darker than ones which live in lighter, sandy environments.

Tropidurus

Tropidurus is a genus of reptiles. The genus "Tropidurus" includes many species of Neotropical ground lizards (family Tropiduridae). "Tropidurus" is the type genus of the family Tropiduridae.

Species in the genus "Tropidurus" are found on the South American mainland, especially in the Amazon Rainforest but also in more arid regions.

There is no widely used common name solely for species of the genus "Tropidurus". In their native range they are simply called "iguanas" as are most similar animals. If anything, the Brazilian term calango is used to particularly refer to lizards of the genus "Tropidurus".

The genus "Tropidurus" contains 30 described species, but new ones continue to be discovered. An additional seven species—the Galápagos lava lizards endemic to the Galápagos Islands—are sometimes placed here too, but more commonly separated in the genus "Microlophus" instead. Similarly, the green thornytail iguana and tropical thorny iguana are now often separated in the minor but probably distinct "Uracentron" lineage instead. In this article, these two genera are kept separate, while Platynotus", "Strobilurus, and Tapinurus are included in "Tropidurus".

Males and females of all "Tropidurus" species are marked differently. The male is usually much larger than the female, and its body is more brightly coloured and distinctly patterned. The average size of "Tropidurus" lizards varies greatly from habitat to habitat as does the pattern of body markings. Markings vary considerably, even among individuals of the same species. Like many lizards, they show changes of colour with mood and temperature.

<doc id="335197" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=335197" title="Cordylus">
Cordylus

The genus Cordylus (Sauria: Cordylidae) includes a wide variety of small- to medium-sized spiny lizards from Africa, collectively called girdle-tailed or girdled lizards. All are diurnal and ovoviviparous (live-bearing, without shelled eggs). Most species are rupicolous (rock-dwelling), while a few species are arboreal or live in burrows. They defend themselves with osteoderms (flat bony plates in the skin) and by quickly retreating into rock crevices or burrows. Many species live in groups and males defend territories.

Cordylids are generally listed under CITES Appendix II. They are not necessarily threatened with extinction, but trade is controlled to prevent overexploitation. Some species of "Cordylus" have limited ranges and may be threatened with habitat destruction or over collecting for the pet trade.

Broadley (2006) recognized 47 species in the genus "Cordylus", including eight species originally placed in the genus "Pseudocordylus" ("P. fasciatus", "P. langi", "P. melanotus", "P. microlepidotus", "P. nebulosus", "P. spinosus", "P. subviridis", and "P. transvaalensis") and "Hemicordylus capensis". The greatest diversity of cordylids is in South Africa, with a few species found in Angola and eastern Africa as far north as Ethiopia. Other members of the Cordylidae are the genera "Chamaesaura" (a group of legless lizards from southern and eastern Africa) and "Platysaurus". The sister group of Cordylidae is the plated lizards, family Gerrhosauridae.

In 2011, a study based on the molecular phylogeny of the family suggested several species traditionally included in "Cordylus" should be moved to other genera: "Hemicordylus" (for "capensis" and "nebulosus"), "Karusasaurus" (for "jordani" and "polyzonus"), "Namazonurus" (for "campbelli", "lawrenci", "namaquensis", "peersi" and "pustulatus"), "Ninurta" (for "coeruleopunctatus"), "Ouroborus" (for "cataphractus") and "Smaug" (for "breyeri", "giganteus", "mossambicus", "regius", "vandami" and "warreni"). This classification is supported by the "Reptile Database" where 22 species remain in "Cordylus".

Ablepharus

Ablepharus is a genus of skinks that contains the common snake-eyed skinks. Both their scientific and common names refer to the fact that their eyelids have fused to a translucent capsule; as in snakes, they thus are physically incapable of blinking. They are small lizards and prefer to live in the leaf litter of dry fields and hills. Their scales give them a very shiny, bronze appearance with a characteristically dark stripe down the sides of their bodies. They prey on small insects and other small mollusks.

The scales on all "Ablepharus" species are shiny and bronze in appearance. Also, a very characteristic bronze stripe runs the length of the dorsal surface of the body. They have short, weak front legs, which contribute to their moving in a serpentine-like manner. In general, females are longer and weigh more than their male counterparts. "Ablepharus" species have thick tails relative to their body sizes and lengths. Fully mature "Ablepharus" species can reach a total length (including tail) of up to . On average, both males and females reach a total length of up to about .

As a whole, "Ablepharus" skinks are generally shy creatures. They tend to bask in the sunlight during the daytime and become more active as dusk and darkness approach. They make their homes in rocky areas with leaf litter and little soil.

The geographic range of the common snake-eyed skink spans from southern European countries to northern African countries; also, some species are native to southeast Asia. While most of the species in the genus prefer remaining low to the ground and in drier environments, some species may be found in damper habitats up to 2,000 m above sea level.

Analysis of the stomach contents of certain "Ablepharus" species has led to the conclusion that common snake-eyed skinks are typically generalist predators. They mainly feed on small arthropods, mollusks, and small snails.

In captivity, common snake-eyed skinks are known to survive up to three and a half years; in the wild, where they are preyed upon, they live about two and a half years. Upon reaching reproductive maturity, the female snake-eyed skink lays between two and four eggs at a time; these eggs will then take at least 9 weeks to hatch. Hatchlings typically measure around 3.5 cm long. About two years are needed for the hatchlings to reach reproductive maturity.

<doc id="341176" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=341176" title="Cryptoblepharus">
Cryptoblepharus

Cryptoblepharus is a genus of skinks (family Scincidae)

A genus established in 1834 by the zoologist Arend Friedrich August Wiegmann.
The type species of the genus was not nominated by the author, but this was assigned to "Ablepharus poecilipleurus" Wiegmann, 1834 in a revision by Leonhard Stejneger published in 1899.
An emendation to the name as "Cryptoblepharis" by J. T. Cocteau in 1836 is considered a synonym, as is "Petia", the name published by John Edward Gray in 1839 without a type or description.

They occupy a fairly basal position among the "Eugongylus" group.

"Cryptoblepharus" species, some of which are often seen in urban environments, are commonly named as fence skinks, or by characteristics such as their lack of eyelids, snake-eyed skinks, or as shining-skinks for their glossy skins.

A genus of Scincidae, small bodied species that lack eyelids, are pentadactyl, and have shiny scales. They are able to move rapidly and with great agility, snatching insects from the air and climbing vertical surfaces with ease. They are often observed basking in the sun and disappearing to a hole or crevice in response to a perceived threat.
Females may share an site to deposit their eggs, the species returning annually to lay a small clutch.

There are a large number of species, with a distribution range across many continents; they are the most widespread genus of the scincid family. Species are found at the east coast of Africa and on Madagascar in a western Indian Ocean range that is isolated from the species found in a region that includes Australia, Indonesia, New Guinea and the Pacific area. Outlying from the Pacific region are species found at three areas on the west coast of South America.
The species are often associated with vertical, often rocky microhabitats and other niches, foraging and residing on surfaces that lack available water. Cliffs and rocks are typical abodes, sandstone near shorelines in a common habitat for some species, as well as trees in forest environments, and they are known to occur at ground level to forage or commute to another location or in environments that lack this habitat. The species may be locally common to abundant, in numbers up to twenty or thirty at a cliff, rock pile or other favoured site.

All species are oviparous, each female laying several eggs, and sexes are strongly dimorphic, the female distinguished by larger overall size with proportionally shorter head and legs. Detailed aspects of the reproduction activity are poorly known, especially the secretive manner in which the female places the eggs. Several sites of "Cryptoblepharus" species have been located, the include within the inner chambers of ant plants in New Guinea, ant inhabited species of Rubiaceae which also contained the broods of several females.
The ability to occupy vertical environs is favoured by the fences and brick walls of urbanisation, where clusters of eggs have also occasionally been discovered within the cavities, and glimpses of them basking in the sun are frequently made before they rapidly flee any disturbance. When seen on a tree, the arboreal species will continually circle to the opposite side to evade a possible threat.

Feeding is probably opportunistic, any arthropod that is small enough to consume, which is known to include spiders, ants and termites. Trails of winged ants have been observed as feeding opportunities, and some species are recorded seizing dead insects being carried by a line of worker ants. Juvenile fish are also known to be eaten.
These skink are a source of food to a number of predators, but which species are able to capture them is also poorly surveyed. An individual has been observed as prey to a centipede, albeit when both were trapped ("C. cygnatus"), and they are a known prey item of other lizards, such as the pygopod "Lialis burtonis".
A revision of Australasian species, published in two papers in 2007, compared morphological and molecular phylogenies and concluded that there was unrecognised diversity within the genus.
The author, Paul Horner of the Northern Territory Museum, published revised systematics that sampled widely distributed populations in the Australian region, with small samples of taxa from other regions, to identify twenty five taxa in Australia, another thirteen in the southwest of the Indian oceanic area, and a further twenty four in the Indo-Pacific, listing 62 taxonomic descriptions of the genus in total.

Ctenotus is a genus of skinks (family Scincidae). The genus belongs to a clade in the "Sphenomorphus" group which contains such genera as "Anomalopus" and the close relatives "Eulamprus" and "Gnypetoscincus".

Lizards in the genus "Ctenotus" are commonly called comb-eared skinks, a reference to the scales aligned near the ear. "Ctenotus" lizards are able to move very quickly, disappearing whilst being observed. They are highly active in their habits, foraging amongst a diverse range of habitat.

The members of the genus "Ctenotus" are widely distributed, in all states of Australia, and are especially diverse in arid regions and the tropical north, accounting for 10–20% of the lizard species. Around a quarter of lizards found in one area of the Great Sandy Desert are "Ctenotus" skinks, 11 of the 40 species. A single dune may have up to six species of "Ctenotus". The Southwest Australian region contains 23 species. The size ranges from very small to moderately large, being similarly varied in body types from slender to stout. The diversity of forms allows species to occupy different niches, often in the same locality.

"Ctenotus" is the most diverse reptile genus in Australia, with approximately 100 member species. Identification to the rank of species is regarded as difficult, and the largest lizard genus is also one of the most poorly understood.

Egernia

Egernia is a genus of skinks (family Scincidae) that occurs in Australia. These skinks are ecologically diverse omnivores that inhabit a wide range of habitats. However, in the loose delimitation (which incorporates about 30 species) the genus is not monophyletic but an evolutionary grade, as has long been suspected due to its lack of characteristic apomorphies.

Some of the skinks traditionally placed in "Egernia" appear to be among the most intelligent squamates. They have been shown to be able to distinguish between relatives and unrelated conspecifics, and can recognize relatives individually. Several species form monogamous pair-bonds. Most of these species belong to "Egernia sensu stricto", and similar behaviour is also known in the related Solomon Islands skink ("Corucia zebrata"). The latter means that the high intelligence and social skills are probably plesiomorphic for the "Egernia" genus-group as a whole, and that the solitary species appear to have evolved towards being less intelligent and social again. It may still be, however, that the intelligent behaviour is a homoplasy that evolved several times in the "Egernia" genus-group; the fact that "Corucia" is a monotypic and rather distinct genus makes it impossible to decide at present.

It is the namesake genus of the "Egernia" genus-group, which also includes the Solomon Islands skink ("Corucia"), "Cyclodomorphus" and the blue-tongued skinks ("Tiliqua"). In some older works, it is considered closely related to "Mabuya", but even among the subfamily Lygosominae this genus does not seem to be particularly closely related and would—were the genus-groups treated at the rarely used rank of infrafamily—certainly constitute an infrafamily of its own. On the other hand, the enigmatic crocodile skinks ("Tribolonotus") might be a very basal member of the "Egernia" genus-group.

The genus "Egernia" proper, as well as the other lineages, appear to be of Miocene—probably Early Miocene—origin, meaning they radiated at least 15, maybe 20 million years ago (mya). There are fossils of "Egernia"-like Lygosominae from around the Oligocene-Miocene boundary 23 mya, but these cannot be assigned to the present genus with certainty. Rather, they appear to be basal members of the "Egernia" genus-group, still very plesiomorphic Lygosominae with a habitus similar to "Mabuya".

Mid-sized to large skinks (adult snout-vent length 100–240 mm) with a bulky, usually somewhat flattened body and small eyes. 24–46 rows of midbody scales; dorsal scales smooth, ridged, keeled or spiny (the tail is often notably spiny). The nasal scale has a postnarial groove; the subocular scale row is incomplete. Eyelids similar in colour to the adjacent scales.

"Nota bene": A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than "Egernia".

Cladistic analysis of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4, 12S rRNA, "c-mos" and β-fibrinogen intron 7 DNA sequence data delimits 3 clades, "Bellatorias", "Liopholis", and "Lissolepis" in "Egernia sensu lato", which are best regarded as separate genera — as had already been often proposed in former times, as early as the 19th century.

Eumeces

The genus Eumeces (family Scincidae) comprises four African to Middle-Eastern skink species.

Recently two taxonomic revisions have been made regarding the 19th century genus "Eumeces". They both resulted in similar results; the genus is paraphyletic and must be "sliced up" into several different genera. Griffith "et al." (2000) proposed that the type species for "Eumeces", "E. pavimentatus", which is considered by many to be a subspecies of "Eumeces schneiderii", should be changed to "Lacerta fasciata", so that the genus name "Eumeces" would stay with the most species-rich clade. However, this petition has not been verified by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Schimtz "et al." argued that Griffith "et al." violated the Code and rejected the proposal on good grounds. Thus only the African species of the "Eumeces schneiderii" group belong to the genus "Eumeces".

Within "Eumeces" the following species are recognized:

The genus "Lampropholis" was previously found to belong to a clade with the genera "Niveoscincus", "Leiolopisma" and others of the "Eugongylus" group within Lygosominae. They are found mainly in Indonesia and Australia. For similar skinks see genera "Bassiana", "Pseudemoia", and "Niveoscincus".

Garden skinks feed on larger invertebrates, including crickets, moths, slaters, earthworms, flies, grubs and caterpillars, grasshoppers, cockroaches, earwigs, slugs, dandelions, small spiders, chaparras, ladybeetles and many other small insects, which makes them a very helpful animal around the garden. They can also feed on fruit and vegetables, but the vegetables have to be cooked for the skink to be able to eat it. Skinks especially love bananas and strawberries etc. (no citrus fruit). Garden skinks rely purely on the movement of their prey when hunting. When hunting, the skinks will either hide and wait for prey to come by or actively pursue it (this depends on how hungry they are). Once they have caught their prey, they shake it around vigorously to kill it before swallowing it whole. Once they have had one meal, they begin to actively pursue prey for a short while with their newfound energy. Skinks only need one prey item per 4 or 5 days, thus, making it an ideal pet for small children. They can eat worms if you drain the soil out of them with salt water because worms are too high in soil for them.

The variation ranges from short-bodied forms with large legs bearing five toes, to elongate forms completely lacking legs. The body length of the lizards is . Their locomotion is linked to their body shape. The shorter skinks with prominent limbs travel on the surface; the longer skinks with reduced legs tend to burrow more. A phylogenetic tree of "Lerista", derived from DNA analysis, reveals that limb loss has happened multiple times within this group. Limb loss has occurred relatively recently, in the past 3.6 million years or so.

All the members look more or less similar and are drab dark brown to blackish in complexion with paler undersides. This poorly known groups of lizards are diurnal, insectivorous, terrestrial to semi fossorial in habits. They inhabit deep leaf-litter and grasslands in montane forests and rainforests.

Palatine and pterygoid bones in contact on the median line of the palate, which is toothless;palatine notch small, far behind, corresponding to the posterior notch of the tongue. Teeth conical. Eyelids well developed, scaly. Ear-opening distinct. Nostril pierced in a single nasal; no supranasals; prefrontals small or coalesced; frontoparietals and interparietal distinct. Limbs well developed, anterior with 4, posterior with 5 digits; claws completely retractile into a large compressed sheath formed of one large scale cleft beneath.

All species in this genus are endemic to the Western Ghats hill-tracts of southwestern India. Currently these skinks have been recorded from the southern and central Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka states. Hill ranges such as Travancore hills, High Ranges, Anaimalai, Nilgiris, Palni Hills, Coorg, Canara and Goa Ghats have been known to harbour these lizards.

<doc id="343870" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=343870" title="Gallotia">
Gallotia

The genus Gallotia are the lacertids (wall lizards) of the Canary Islands. This genus consists of a group that has been evolving there ever since the first islands emerged from the sea over 20 million years ago. The endemic species and subspecies of this group have a number of characteristics that make them quite special within their family (Lacertidae); their only close relatives are the sandrunner lizards ("Psammodromus") of the western Mediterranean region. "Gallotia" are characteristic for eating significant quantities of plants, and for several lineages having evolved insular gigantism.

This genus can be broadly divided into two groups - lineages originating from the colonization of the earliest Canary Islands of Lanzarote, Fuerteventura and Gran Canaria, probably between 10-20 million years ago, and a lineage that colonised the younger western islands probably less than 10 million years. ago (Cox et al., 2010). Both lineages contain large and small species.

MtDNA analyses indicate that Lanzarote and Fuerteventura were colonized first and this led to the small body-sized "G.atlantica" which is present today (Cox et al., 2010). Gran Canaria was the next island to have been colonized from Lanzarote/Fuerteventura, giving rise to the large body-sized species, "G. stehlini" (Cox et al., 2010). Finally, the clade that colonized the younger western islands was likely to have originated from Lanzarote/Fuerteventura. This western island clade diverged into two groups, all of which colonized Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro, leading to 1) a medium-bodied (e.g., "G. caesaris" from El Hierro) and 2) a large bodied "giant" species (e.g., "G. simonyi" from El Hierro) on each of these islands (note that "G. intermedia" from Tenerife belongs to the "giant" group, but present-day individuals are not that large). The giant species now exist, at best, in small relict populations, while "G. auritae" may be extinct on La Palma. (These patterns are based on analyses of mtDNA.) It is possible that remains of extinct giant forms will eventually be discovered on Fuerteventura & Lanzarote.

Prehistoric remains were assigned to the taxa "G. goliath" and "G. maxima", the former supposedly occurring on several islands, the latter only on Tenerife. It was eventually determined, however, that "G. maxima" is a junior synonym of "G. goliath", and that the latter was very close to "G. simonyi"; supposed "goliath" specimens from El Hierro, La Gomera, and La Palma are probably just extremely large individuals of, respectively, "G. simonyi", "G. bravoana", and "G. auaritae" (Barahona "et al." 2000). However, a mummified giant specimen from Tenerife yielded ancient DNA remains, and by analysis of this, it was concluded that "G. goliath" is a valid species that probably was restricted to Tenerife, and apparently was closer to "G. intermedia" than to "G. simonyi" (Maca-Meyer "et al." 2003).

Though lizards of the genus "Acanthodactylus" prefer dry and sparsely vegetated regions, they are not strictly tied to an arid terrain; so it is not uncommon to come across them in various environments.

Members of the genus "Acanthodactylus" possess the following combination of traits:

Darevskia

Darevskia is a genus of wall lizards of the family Lacertidae living in the Caucasus, Iran and Turkey in forest and grassy habitats with numerous rock outcrops. Among rock lizards, 7 parthenogenetic species are known.

These are small lizards with a body length of 50–85 mm and with about two times longer tail. The body is usually flattened, the head is pointed in shape and in most species flattened in a vertical plane, which allows lizards to hide in narrow crevices between stones and rocks. Rock lizards have relatively long legs with special calluses on the inner surfaces of the paws and sharp claws, thanks to which they quickly move along the vertical rough surfaces of rocks and stones.

The color of rock lizards varies from different tones of green to sand. Females are usually colored paler than males. On the dorsal side of the body, rock lizards have an occipital stripe composed of a set of black or brown spots and a wide line of the lizard's main color, and dark patterns on the sides of the body. In some species, blue or violet spots with white circles in the center and / or monotonous blue-violet spots at the junction of the abdominal scutes with trunk scales are located on the anterior third of the body. Most types of rock lizards are characterized by a diverse color of the abdominal side of the body, ranging from various shades of pink, red and orange to yellow and green.

The generic name, "Darevskia", is in honor of Russian herpetologist Ilya Sergeyevich Darevsky.

In 1830, Professor of Kazan University E. A. Eversman (1794-1860) made an expedition to the North Caucasus, as a result of which he described two new species: a meadow lizard (Lacerta praticola (Eversman 1834)) and a rock lizard (Lacerta saxicola (Eversman 1834)). At that time, European scientists did not recognize the independence of the species L. saxicola, considering it as part of the European L. muralis (Laurenti 1768). But at the beginning of the XX century between the two zoologists Mecheli (1862–1953) and Boulanger (1858–1937) there was a lengthy discussion about the taxonomic position of L. saxicola, which was resolved in favor of the former, and L. saxicola and subspecies were further considered separately from L. muralis. For several decades, scientists from different countries studied the monophyletic group of rock lizards independently, highlighting new subspecies, simplifying some taxa and describing new species. It was on this group of lizards that the phenomenon of parthenogenesis in amniotic vertebrates was first discovered by the Russian zoologist I. S. Darevsky (1924-2009), who also made a significant contribution to understanding the ecology, systematics, and morphology of rock lizards. And in 1997, the Spanish scientist Arribas named the genus of rock lizards Darevskia and identified the type species D. saxicola.

According to Arribas (1997), the genus Darevskia includes four groups (clades), combining species by origin and kinship: “raddei”, “rudis”, “saxicola” and “caucasica”. Subsequently, three more clades were identified: “praticola”, “chlorogaster”, and “defilippii”. In total, the genus includes 34 species, 7 of which breed parthenogenetically, and 22 subspecies.

The following species are recognized as being valid.

"Nota bene": A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than "Darevskia".

Rock lizards are common in Abkhazia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Iran, Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia (Adygea, Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, Krasnodar Territory, Republic of Crimea, North Ossetia-Alania, Stavropol Territory and Chechnya) , in Turkey and South Ossetia. It is worth noting that the boundaries of the range of some species are not reliably known, but the expected areas of their encounters coincide with the already indicated distribution sites for the whole genus

Rock lizards are found in various high-altitude zones from 0 to 3000 meters above sea level and occupy a variety of landscapes: mountain-steppe, forest-steppe, mountain meadow, mountain forest, anthropogenic and coastal. By confinement to one or another habitat, they can be conditionally divided into several groups:

1) Lizards living in the forest, according to the occupied microreliefs, are divided into: adhering to rock outcrops (D. raddei, D. brauneri) and independent of them, able to live in habitats in which there are no rocks, using rodent burrows as shelters, deciduous litter, cavities in trees and bark (e.g. D. chlorogaster, D. armeniaca).

2) Inhabitants in areas of bedrock outcrops and clayey cliffs in alpine and subalpine meadows. As shelters, they often use rodent burrows, cavities between stones and cracks in the rocks. These habitats are adhered to by D. alpine and D. mixta, D. armeniaca and D. valentini.

3) Rock lizards of dry and moderately dry landscapes (alpine steppes) of rocks and their feet on slopes with dry-loving shrubbery and grassy vegetation, road slopes. Such habitats have a large number of crevices and voids serving as shelters for lizards. Such species are found in such landscapes as: D. rudis, D. portschinski, D. daghestanica, D. raddei, D. saxicola.

4) Occupying anthropogenic habitats: an abandoned building, walls in cities, abandoned temples, monasteries, etc., where their number often exceeds that in natural habitats. For example, D. armeniaca, D. lindholmi, D. dahli.

Rock lizards are found at heights of 0 - 3000 m above sea level. Zonal and geographical distribution is determined by the amount of precipitation, average annual temperature, duration of the adverse season, and exposure of the slope. For example, D. daghestanica on the southern slope of the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range (South Ossetia) is distributed at altitudes of 1500-1800 meters above sea level, and on the northern slopes (Dagestan) - 50 - 2100 meters above sea level.

Rock lizards feed on various invertebrates with a body size from a few millimeters to 4 cm: spiders, dipterous, lepidoptera, hymenoptera, cockroaches, orthoptera, semi-rigid-winged, coleoptera, wood lice, worms, slugs, marine and freshwater amphipods, caddis flies, chironomids and sometimes parts of plants.. Also, particular cases of cannibalism were recorded when adults ate juvenile individuals.

Despite the diversity of the food supply, rock lizards can develop preferences for feeding invertebrates of a certain group (for example, flying forms of ants), which is caused by seasonal changes in the availability or abundance of this type of prey. Even after a significant reduction in the density of invertebrates of this group, lizards continue to hunt for some time in the presence of more accessible food objects.

Rock lizards are extremely rare on their own, usually forming settlements. The population density of parthenogenetic rock lizards can vary in a wider range than that of bisexual species: up to 200 individuals per 1 km of the route in unisexual species and up to 80 individuals in bisexual species, which is explained by the fact that parthenogenetic species are less aggressive and have a high population growth rate.

Rock lizards are characterized by complex and diverse social systems, which, in particular, are characterized by stable long-term friendly relations between the male and the female and territorial or hierarchical relations between individuals of the same sex.

The basis of the settlements of bisexual rock lizards are sedentary males and females with individual sites, often overlapping. In a number of species, some males possess territories protected from other males. The territories of males never overlap, but their centers of activity, primarily associated with basking, coincide with the centers of activity of females that live within their territories.

The study of the social behavior and spatial structure of rock lizard populations has been the subject of a number of scientific papers published based on the results of many years of research

The seasonal activity of rock lizards is determined by temperature indicators and, therefore, species living at different heights differ in terms of exit from wintering shelters, mating period, laying of eggs, hatching of young individuals and time of leaving for wintering. Around the end of February until the end of May, exit from wintering shelters occurs, and the active period is from 6 - 7 months (in the mountains) and up to 9 - 10 months (in the valleys and on the seashore). During this period, mature individuals mate, and females lay eggs. Hibernation takes place from late September to mid November.

The beginning and end of the daily activity of the lizard is determined by the lighting conditions within the individual area, and in some individuals it can start early in the morning, while individuals living on the slopes of the northern exposure or in deep forest valleys are active for several hours in the middle of the day [4]. After heating (basking), the body temperature of the lizard reaches about 30 - 34 ° C, and it begins a routine activity aimed at supporting the body . Late in the evening, when the heat subsides, the animals return to the basking places and stay there for some time, after which they go to their night shelters.

Rock lizards reach maturity in the second (females) and third (males) year of life with a total life expectancy of up to 13 years. Mating of some types of rock lizards occurs after the first molt, approximately 3-5 weeks after leaving wintering (D. brauneri), in others, immediately after leaving wintering shelter (D. valentini). Egg laying begins in the second half of June and lasts until early August. In clutch usually 2 to 7 eggs. The incubation period lasts approximately 55 - 65 days. Young animals with a body length of about 25 mm are born in late summer.

Separation of the genus Darevskia from the subfamily Lacertinae occurred approximately 12-16 million years ago, in the middle of the Miocene. Presumably, the ancestral form of the genus Darevskia penetrated the territory of the Western Caucasus in the Middle Miocene or in the Middle Pliocene, when there was a land connection between Asia Minor and the Balkans.

The genus of rock lizards has 7 parthenogenetic species: D. armeniaca, D. bendimahiensis, D. dahli, D. rostombekovi, D. sapphirina, D. unisexualis and D. uzzelli, resulting from the hybridization of males and females of different bisexual species. Moreover, D. valentini and D. portschinskii always enter as paternal species, and D. mixta, D. nairensis, D. raddei always enter as maternal species. From the point of view of the classical concept of a species, homosexual taxa cannot be assigned a species status due to the lack of exchange of genetic material between individuals within the same population. However, on the basis of morphological and cytogenetic characters, they are assigned a species rank.

The appearance of parthenogenetic species is usually associated with the last, Wurm glaciation. Parthenogenetic rock lizards appeared about 10 thousand years ago when, due to the formation of mountain glaciers, the habitats of the parent bisexual species were disturbed, which led to the overlap of their ranges and the hybridogenic formation of parthenogenetic individuals better adapted to the conditions of short summers and long winters. Due to the doubled reproduction rate and successful resettlement, same-sex populations later began to exist independently of the parent species.

Hybridization occurs in places where the ranges of parthenogenetic and bisexual species overlap, resulting in the appearance of triploid sterile females and a small number of males, with changes in the reproductive system (malfunctions in the formation of reproductive products, hermaphroditism). Nevertheless, presumably, these males are able to give offspring, which leads to the appearance of tetraploid hybrids. Sometimes males emerge from unfertilized eggs laid by parthenogenetic females. Like males of hybrid origin, they have reproductive disorders, which may not interfere with their offspring. A small amount of parthenogenetic female males emerging from clutches is explained by frequently occurring mutations incompatible with life.

Despite the fact that as a result of parthenogenesis, individuals are born that receive hereditary material only from the mother’s body, a small intraspecific genetic diversity has been revealed due to mutational processes, genetic instability and the appearance of same-sex species as a result of repeated and independent crossing of parental species among themselves.

<doc id="343880" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=343880" title="Gastropholis">
Gastropholis

Gastropholis is a genus of Equatorial African lacertid lizards of the family Lacertidae which is distributed in southern Liberia, Ivory Coast and Ghana, western Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Democratic Republic of Congo, eastern Kenya, Tanzania and south to northeastern Mozambique.

"Gastropholis" is derived from the ancient Greek words "gaster" (γαστήρ) which means "belly, stomach" and, "pholis" (φολῐ́ς), a "horny scale of a reptile". The common name of these lizards is Keel-bellied Lizards.

Not much is known but all species of this genus are diurnal, arboreal and often secretive. They inhabit forests, woodland and thicket of coastal plains from sea level to 2000 m altitude. Usually they live high up in the trees 10 m or more above ground level and hide in holes or under loose bark. For sun-basking and feeding (insects and other arthropods, also smaller lizards) they move on branches using their prehensile tails as balancing organs.

Eggs are laid in moist tree holes. "Gastropholis prasina" is known to produce clutches of five-ten eggs. At 26-29 °C incubation temperature the eggs hatched after 61 days.

"Gastropholis" shares with the other genera of Equatorial African lacertids (EAL; "Adolfus", "Congolacerta", "Holaspis") the consistently absent parietal foramen, the parietal scale extending to the edge of the parietal table and a single postnasal scale.

The species of "Gastropholis" are characterized by a high ventral scale count (10-14 rows, other EAL only 6 rows transversely), keeled ventrals (smooth in all other EAL), and a long prehensile tail. "Gastropholis" species are the largest of the EAL clade with adult snout-vent lengths of 80–110 mm.
They are well adapted for climbing with their long limbs, hooked claws and long tails. For a key to the species of "Gastropholis" see Arnold (1989).

Four species are recognized:

<doc id="343881" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=343881" title="Holaspis">
Holaspis

Holaspis is a genus of equatorial African lizards in the family Lacertidae. These lizards are capable of gliding flight for distances of 30 meters (98 feet).

The New Latin word ""Holaspis" " is derived from the Greek words ""aspis"", ἀσπίς (= a buckler, or round shield) and ""holos"", ὅλος, ὅλως (= whole, all, complete). It refers to the head scalation with frontoparietal and occipital scales all fused.

In morphology-based parsimony and compatibility analyses (1989) recognized a clade called the "Equatorial African group" including "Adolfus", "Gastropholis", and "Holaspis". In all lacertids of this clade the parietal foramen is consistently absent, the parietal scale extends to the edge of the parietal table, and the postnasal scale is single.
In "Holaspis" the head and body are very depressed, frontoparietal and occipital scales are all fused to shields, the tail is depressed with lateral fringes of scales, and the third and fourth toes of the forefoot are fused for nearly their entire joint. There are two longitudinal rows of smooth broad band-like scales down the vertebral line of the back and on the tail. The ventral scales are smooth.
The collar is composed of 9 to 15 small scales. 16 to 24 femoral pores are present, more developed in males. Maximum total length (including tail) in both species is , and maximum snout-vent-length (SVL) is . There is no sexual dimorphism in SVL, but males have larger heads and their tail base is wider.

Dorsally the ground colour is black. On the head from the tip of the snout to the nape of the neck there is a yellow to yellow greenish median line. On each side of the back outside the large dorsal scales there runs a turquoise to sky blue longitudinal stripe which fuses on the tail base. From there it travels as a clear blue stripe partly interrupted onto the tip of the tail. 
The pattern of the flanks differs in the two species: In "H. guentheri" there are two yellowish brown to greyish lines on the flanks while in "H. laevis" there runs only one broader yellowish brown to red brown or usually beige stripe from the tip of the snout to the hind limb. The wide tail scales on the sides are yellow to orange-coloured.

The number of light or dark stripes is the only known external morphological difference between the two species. As Arnold (1989) wrote:
H. guentheri: "A dark vertebral stripe on body and three dark stripes on each side".
H. laevis: "A dark vertebral stripe and two dark stripes on each side".

Ventrally the lizards are coloured yellow or orange to greenish-orange, partly with a mother-of-pearl shimmer. Males are often more brightly coloured. Juveniles resemble their parents but the coloured dorsal stripes are narrower and less intensely coloured. Ventrally the juveniles are pitch-black in contrast to the adults.

"Holaspis" are diurnal, arboreal, extremely agil lacertids and able to move on vertical and overhanging surfaces with body and tail pressed closely to the surface. They live on larger trees at least above the forest floor in primary forest, man-influenzed areas and even in Eucalyptus forest with smooth bark but are not found in closed forest. The serrated tail is considered as an additional tree climbing adaption to increase grip.

They are active hunters of small insects and other arthropods like ants, grasshoppers and spiders, often investigating crevices in which they also frequently hide.

Not much is known about the reproduction in nature. More than one clutch/year is produced. Females lay two eggs under loose bark or in leaf litter. Specimen from northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo laid eggs in June and females from Nyasaland caught on 3 August held two well developed eggs.

The species of "Holaspis" are unique among lacertids in being capable of gliding flight between trees up to 30 m distance. Adaptions for gliding are the flat body and tail, the fused fingers and their low body mass. Their bones are packed full of air spaces, making the lizard's skeleton feather light for gliding.

They are less specialized for flight than species of the agamid genus "Draco" or gekkonid genus "Ptychozoon".

"Holaspis" species are occasionally kept as pets. But "Holaspis guentheri" and "H. laevis" are often confused in pet trade or generally named "H. guentheri" because "H. laevis" was formerly only a subspecies of "H. guentheri". Nearly all "Holaspis" in the pet trade are "H. laevis". For discrimination of the two species see "Description". Captive breeding resulted in an increase of information on the biology of "Holaspis".

Two species are recognized as being valid. Formerly "H. laevis" was a subspecies of "H. guentheri".

Latastia

Latastia is a genus of lizards of the family Lacertidae. Species of this genus are distributed in Africa (Egypt, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Cameroon, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Zambia, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Tanzania) but one subspecies ("Latastia longicaudata andersonii") lives in Yemen. Collectively, they are known as long-tailed lizards.

Jacques von Bedriaga named this genus in honor of French herpetologist Fernand Lataste.

Species of "Latastia" are medium to large-sized lacertids with long cylindrical tails. The unregenerated tail is up to 3.2 times longer than head and body. Eyes with movable lids. The nostril is surrounded by 3-5 scales and usually reaches the first supralabial. The collar is well marked. Ventral plates smooth and in 6 longitudinal series (sometimes 8-10 with outer plates small). The dorsal scales are homogenous, small and granular or imbricate. There are no expanded scales along the mid-back line as in "Philochortus". Femoral pores are present on the inside of the thighs, more prominent in males. Tail base in males much broader than in females.

Most long-tailed lizards of the genus "Latastia" inhabit well vegetated sandy or gravelly plains and large wadis in western and eastern Africa. They can be found in semidesert scrubland and deciduous "Acacia"-"Commiphora" bushland where scrubby undergrowth is plentiful, in moist savanna and high grassland or in millet fields. "Latastia boscai boscai" and "L. b. burii" are known to occur in stony and rocky localities. Species of "Latastia" are distributed from sea level to 2000 m altitude.
They are diurnal, heliophilous and terrestrial, extremely wary fast-running lacertids which wander over large territories but forage mostly within vegetation cover during the heat of the day. They dart out into the sun to capture insects and other arthropods, after which they retreat into shady areas beneath bushes (thermoregulation). All species lay eggs but clutch details are known only for "L. longicaudata". The population in Senegal ("L. l. longicaudata") produces clutches of 5-7 eggs between July and September while females of "L. l. revoili" in southeastern Kenya lay only 3-4 eggs/clutch. Hatchlings appear during the wet season.

The genus is composed of 10 recognized species. Subspecies are described for "Latastia boscai", "L. doriai", and "L. longicaudata".

Philochortus is a genus of lizards of the family Lacertidae. Species of this genus are distributed in Egypt, Algeria, Libya, Mali, Niger, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia, Kenya, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia.

"Philochortus" means grass-loving (Greek: "philos" = friend, "chortos" = grass). The common name of "Philochortus" species is therefore grass-loving lizards, or shield-backed ground lizards because of their typical back scalation and terrestrial habitat.

Species of "Philochortus" are medium to large-sized lacertids with long cylindrical tails. The unregenerated tail is up to 3.25 times longer than head and body. Eyes with movable lids. The nostril is pierced between two shields and usually bordered by the first supralabial or narrowly separated from it. The collar is well marked. The ventral plates are smooth, feebly imbricate and arranged in 6 longitudinal series. The dorsal scales are smooth or keeled. Back with 2 to 6 longitudinal series of enlarged plate-like scales along the dorsal mid-line. This is the main difference to "Latastia". Femoral pores are present on the inside of the thighs, more prominent in males. Tail base in males much broader than in females.

The natural history of all species of "Philochortus" is only poorly known. Many of the species inhabit semiarid, arid or hyperarid regions, mountainous areas as well as plains from sea level up to 1500 m altitude ("P. neumanni" ). Most species prefer sparsely vegetated, open and sandy or fairly rocky localities ("P. neumanni" ) and can be found in "Acacia"-"Commiphora" deciduous bushland and semidesert bushland vegetation types. But "P. zolii" and "P. neumanni" can be found also in marginal unattended cultivated areas with "Desmostachya bipinnata" grass and other scrub and well vegetated natural habitats.

The species of "Philochortus" are diurnal, sun-loving active predators on insects and other arthropods, egg-laying and terrestrial but "P. zolii" is an avid climber. The long stiff tail is aiding in balance on vegetation. They dig burrows in the soil below clumps of grasses or small bushes.

Pseuderemias is a genus of lizards of the family Lacertidae. Common names for the genus are false sand lizards or racerunners.

Species of this genus are distributed from southeastern Egypt (Gebel Elba region) along coastal regions of the Red Sea in Sudan to Eritrea, eastern Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia and northern Kenya. The center of the diversification of this genus is Somalia.

"Pseuderemias" are small to medium-sized dorso-laterally compressed lacertids with very narrow snouts. Each nostrils is surrounded by four nasal scales and is not reached by the first supralabial. The upper head shields are smooth, rugose or pitted. The eyes have movable lids. There is no vertebral series of enlarged scales down the middle of the back, the dorsal scales are roughly homogenous. A collar is present. The ventral scales are smooth and arranged in six to ten longitudinal rows. The toes are strongly compressed and the subdigital lamellae are keeled. The tail is long, up to three times as long as head and body. Femoral pores are present.

The ground colour is greyish or light brown to brownish red, brick red, dark brown or almost black. On the back there are usually some creme or whitish stripes and/or dots which are arranged in longitudinal lines. Some species like "P. erythrosticta" lack stripes and are spotted with dark dots. Hatchlings are generally more intensely striped than adults.

Only one species ("P. mucronata") reaches north to Egypt and inhabits along the Red Sea coastal dunes and sandy plains with fairly good vegetation cover. Other species are distributed in low-lying, arid Somali-Masai "Acacia"-"Commiphora" deciduous bushland and semi-desert shrubland vegetation in eastern Africa.

<doc id="343908" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=343908" title="Heloderma">
Heloderma

Heloderma, or beaded lizards, are large, stocky, slow-moving reptiles that prefer semi-arid climates. Their tails are short and used as fat storage organs. They are covered with small, non-overlapping, bead-like scales, with osteoderms on the undersides of their bodies. All species are dark in color, with yellowish or pinkish markings. "Heloderma" is the only living genus of the family Helodermatidae.

Beaded lizards are venomous. Venom glands are located in their lower jaws, unlike snakes' venom glands, which are located in their upper jaws. Also, unlike snakes, beaded lizards lack the musculature to inject venom. The venom is typically used only in defense, rather than in subduing prey, and the lizard must chew its victim to work the venom into the flesh. Venom glands are believed to have evolved early in the lineage leading to the modern helodermatids, as their presence is indicated even in the 65-million-year-old fossil genus "Paraderma". Venom production among lizards was long thought to be unique to this genus, but researchers studying venom production have proposed many others also produce some venom, all placed in the clade Toxicofera, which includes all snakes and 13 other families of lizards. However, except for snakes, helodermatids, and possibly varanids, envenomation is not considered medically significant for humans.

Helodermatids are carnivorous, preying on rodents and other small mammals, and eating the eggs of birds and reptiles. They are oviparous, laying large clutches of eggs.

Family Helodermatidae

Members of the genus "Heloderma" have many extinct relatives in the Helodermatidae whose evolutionary history may be traced back to the Cretaceous period, such as "Estesia". The genus "Heloderma" has existed since the Miocene, when "H. texana" lived, and fragments of osteoderms from the Gila monster have been found in late Pleistocene (8,000-10,000 years ago) deposits near Las Vegas, Nevada. Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the beaded lizards and the Gila monster appear closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia, and Australia, the wide geographical separation and unique features not found in the varanids indicates they are better placed in a separate family.

The type species is "Heloderma horridum", which was first described in 1829 by Arend Weigmann. Although he originally assigned it the generic name "Trachyderma", he changed it to "Heloderma" six months later, which means "studded skin", from the Ancient Greek words "hêlos" (ηλος)—the head of a nail or stud—and "derma" (δερμα), meaning skin.

"H. horridum", "H. exasperatum", and "H. suspectum" are frequently found in captivity and are well represented in zoos throughout much of the world. They are often bred for the exotic pet trade and can command high prices. The other two species of "Heloderma", "H. alvarezi" and "H. charlesbogerti", are extremely rare, and only a few captive specimens are known.

Cnemidophorus

Cnemidophorus is a genus of lizards in the family Teiidae. Species in the genus "Cnemidophorus" are commonly referred to as whiptail lizards or racerunners. The genus is endemic to South America, Central America, and the West Indies.

Reeder et al. (2002) re-examined the nomenclature for the genus "Cnemidophorus" ("sensu lato") and split it into the two genera "Aspidoscelis" and "Cnemidophorus" ("sensu stricto"). A further split by Harvey et al. (2012) added the genera "Ameivula" and "Contomastix".

The name "Cnemidophorus" literally means "greave-wearing", from the Ancient Greek ' (combining form of ', "greave", a leg armor) and "" ("bearer").

In some of the "Cnemidophorus" species, there are no males, and they reproduce through parthenogenesis. This is well known in bees and aphids, but is very rare in vertebrates. Those species without males are now known to originate through hybridization, or interspecific breeding. Occasionally, a mating between a female of one species and a male of another produces a parthenogen, a female that is able to produce viable eggs that are genetically identical to her own cells. The lizards that hatch from these eggs are thus also parthenogens that can again produce identical eggs, resulting in an asexual, clonal population. Parthenogenetic species resulting from a single hybridization are diploid (that is, they have two sets of chromosomes just as sexual species do), but sometimes these females mate with other males, producing offspring which are triploid (that is, they have three sets of chromosomes, or 50% more than equivalent sexual species; see polyploidy). Over 30% of the genus "Cnemidophorus" are parthenogenic.

The genus "Cnemidophorus" ("sensu stricto") contains the following species which are recognized as being valid.
"Nota bene": A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than "Cnemidophorus".

<doc id="346919" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=346919" title="Dracaena (lizard)">
Dracaena (lizard)

The genus Dracaena (romanized form of the Ancient Greek δράκαινα - "drakaina", "female dragon"), also called caiman lizards or water tegu, is in the teiid family, along with tegus and ameivas. Caiman lizards are found in South America in Ecuador, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru and Brazil. These semiaquatic lizards spend a lot of time in the water and inhabit marshes, streams and flooded forests. Caiman lizards often bask on branches overhanging the water.

Listed alphabetically.

The caiman lizard is built similarly to its cousin the tegu, with a large heavy set body and short but powerful limbs. Its head is bulky and often a red or orange color. Their jaws are heavily muscular to help aid in eating its normal prey of snails, crawfish and fresh water clams. It also has a few adaptations that help it in its watery habitat. It has a long, laterally flattened tail, similar to its name sake, the yacare caiman. The long tail helps the caiman lizard to successfully swim and dive. It also has a clear third eyelid which is thought to act like a pair of goggles underwater.

The coloration of the northern caiman lizard ("Dracaena guianensis") is very similar to that of a crocodile. It is typically a bright green with slight dark green banding. The Paraguayan caiman lizards ("Dracaena paraguayensis") are typically much more drab, with gray bodies and heads. There are tough raised scutes along the dorsal portion of the back. These give the caiman lizard a crocodilian appearance, and help to provide some protection against predators. 
These lizards can become up to long and weigh up to .

Caiman lizards are kept in private collections, but they are not yet kept in large numbers due to their tendency to only accept snails, and their high price. Additionally, caiman lizards are arboreal, aquatic, and burrowing, so suitable enclosures are usually only made by zoos. Caiman lizards born in captivity have been known to take a variety of food items, including snails, fish, cat food, and crustaceans. Their temperament is comparable to that of a tegu.

Tupinambis

Tupinambis is a lizard genus which belongs to the family Teiidae, and contains eight described species. These large lizards are commonly referred to as tegus (teiús in Portuguese); "T. merianae" (Argentine black and white tegu), "T. rufescens" (red tegu), and "T. teguixin" (gold tegu) are popular in the pet trade. They are primarily found in South America, although "T. teguixin" also occurs in Panama. 

In 2012 a number of tegu species were reclassified from "Tupinambis" to the previously used genus "Salvator". The newly proposed classification comes from a restructuring of the family Teiidae based upon the study of 137 morphological characteristics. The new classification is as follows: "Salvator duseni" (yellow tegu), "Salvator rufescens" (red tegu), "Salvator merianae" (black and white tegu), "Tupinambis teguixin" (gold tegu), "Tupinambis longilineus" (Rhondonia tegu), "Tupinambis palustris" (swamp tegu), "Tupinambis quadrilineatus" (four-lined tegu).

"Tupinambis" lizards are called teiú in Portuguese. The lizards are also called tishiriú in the extinct Tuxá language of 
Bahia, Brazil, and dzižuảsu in the extinct Potiguara language of Pernambuco, Brazil.

As with many other animals from tropical South America (e.g. the Cariamae), "Tupinambis" owes its scientific name to the pioneering accounts given by Piso & Marcgrave in their "Historia Naturalis Brasiliae" (1648). However, a misinterpretation (by Linnaeus) of the Latin text occurred, which reads "TEIVGVACV [...] Tupinambis", 'to the Tupinambá [Indians] TEIVGVACU'. "Tupinambis" was merely a metalinguistic term meaning 'to/for the Tupinambá,' whereas the intended, indigenous name for the animal was "teiú-guaçú" [lizard-big], lit. 'big lizard'.

"Tupinambis" have heterodont dentition consisting of four different types of teeth. Incisor-type—tricuspid—teeth reside at the tip of the mouth. Recurved canine-type teeth occur further back on the tooth row. Behind those reside a separate set of incisor-like teeth (though flattened in a perpendicular plane to the first set of incisors). The rearmost teeth are blunt, rounded, peg-shaped teeth. The rearmost two tooth classes only occur in sexually mature individuals thus indicating an ontogenetic shift in tooth morphology. Along with changes in tooth type, the frequency of each tooth type also changes with ontogeny, without an overall changes in tooth count (approximately 70 teeth). Rather than increase tooth count, the teeth themselves increase in size as the jaw grows from hatchling to adult. This ontogenetic shift in tooth morphology suggests a shift in diet with age, however few dietary studies have been done to support this claim and limited stomach content observations do not show much variability between hatchlings and juveniles.

Species listed alphabetically by specific name.


Mitochondrial DNA analysis indicates a deep divergence between a northern clade (containing "T. teguixin", "T. palustris", and "T. quadrilineatus") and a southern clade (containing "T. duseni".). The northern and southern clades are morphologically distinct, with the northern clade possessing a single pair of loreal scales between the eye and the nostril and a smooth texture to the scales on the body, and the southern clade possessing two pairs of loreal scales and a bumpy texture to the scales on the body. At least one recent review of the morphology of the family Teiidae has placed the tegus of the southern clade in the genus "Salvator." Subsequent studies support the paraphyletic status of "Tupinambis", though further research will be necessary to determine if the split will gain wider acceptance among the herpetological community. Comparative analysis of hemipenial anatomy also provides support for the split between "Tupinambis" and "Salvator".

Tegus probably originated sometime during the Cenozoic era. "Tupinambis" fossils from Argentina date back to the late-Miocene period. Fossils of the extinct tegu "Paradracaena" can be found in earlier Miocene deposits.

Anguis

Slowworms (also called blindworms) are a small genus (Anguis) of snake-like legless lizards in the family Anguidae. The genus has two living species, the common slowworm and the Peloponnese slowworm and up to three fossil species.

Slowworms are typically grey-brown, with the females having a coppery sheen and two lateral black stripes, and the males displaying electric blue spots, particularly in the breeding season. They give birth to live young, which are about long at birth and generally have golden stripes.

Slowworms are slow-moving and can be easily caught, which has given rise to the folk etymology that the "slow" in slowworm is the same as the English adjective slow; the actual origin is a proto-Germanic root which simply means "slowworm". Like many lizards, slowworms can shed their tails to distract predators. The tail regrows, but never fully. Principal predators are birds, badgers, hedgehogs, foxes and domestic cats.

The average British slowworm can grow to 45 cm when fully mature and weigh about 100 g, females being slightly larger than the males. The tail makes up around half its length, but is indistinguishable from the body. It has been recorded to live for up to 30 years in wild, and the record age for a slowworm in captivity is 54 years (Copenhagen Zoo).

The specific name "fragilis" (fragile) comes from the tendency of this species to shed its own tail, when threatened by predators, or if handled too roughly (caudal autotomy).

Although slowworms much resemble snakes, and are often mistaken for such, they are actually lizards that have lost their limbs completely with evolution.

Slowworms can be distinguished from snakes by several features: their eyelids, which snakes lack entirely; their small ear openings, which again snakes lack; and their tongues, which are notched in the centre rather than completely forked like a snake's.

Slowworms live in any habitat that is warm and protected, such as woodland, grassland, and heathland; they are frequently found in garden compost heaps. They range across most of Europe, and into parts of Asia, but they are restricted to temperate and humid habitats. They hibernate from October to February/March, both communally and solitarily, and sometimes share hibernating sites with other reptiles.

Slowworms have grooved teeth which allow them to grab and swallow whole their soft invertebrate prey, such as slugs, hairless caterpillars, other insects, spiders, and earthworms. Snails are usually avoided, except when they are still very young and the shell can be broken easily.

Slowworms are protected in the United Kingdom and Poland.

<doc id="347835" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=347835" title="Ophisaurus">
Ophisaurus

Ophisaurus (from the Greek 'snake-lizard') is a genus of superficially snake-like lizards in the family Anguidae. Although most species have no legs, their head shapes, movable eyelids, and external ear openings identify them as lizards. A few species have very small, stub-like legs near their rear vents. These are vestigial organs, meaning they once served an evolved purpose but are no longer used. They reach lengths of up to , but about two-thirds of this is the tail. Glass lizards feed on insects, spiders, other small reptiles, and young rodents. Their diets are limited by their inability to unhinge their jaws. Some glass lizards give birth to live young but most lay eggs.

They are so-named because their tails are easily broken; like many lizards, they have the ability to deter predation by dropping off part of the tail, which can break into several pieces, like glass. The tail remains mobile, distracting the predator, while the lizard becomes motionless, allowing eventual escape. This serious loss of body mass requires a considerable effort to replace, and can take years to do so. Despite this ability, the new tail is usually smaller than the original.

Their diets consist primarily of arthropods, with larger animals eating snails and small mammals.

The genus "Ophisaurus" ("sensu lato") contains the following species:
